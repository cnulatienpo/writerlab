1. Decision — Low Potency
Vignette:
Mickey stands in front of the vending machine, eyeing the two sodas left: grape or orange. He always picks grape, but today, for no reason at all, he punches the orange button. The can clatters down. He cracks it open, takes a sip, and shrugs. Not bad.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
That’s right! This is a classic low-potency decision. Mickey’s choice is almost automatic—he picks orange instead of grape for once, but nothing meaningful is at stake. He doesn’t agonize, there’s no emotional buildup, and the outcome barely matters; if he hates the orange soda, he’ll just finish it or toss it out. These sorts of choices—routine, casual, and nearly inconsequential—are everywhere in life and stories. They don’t move the plot, reshape character, or signal a turning point. Instead, they help ground scenes in realism or reveal tiny quirks in behavior. If the story ended here, nothing important would change for Mickey or anyone else.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. A medium-potency decision means the choice comes with some risk or personal significance—a moment where the character hesitates, weighs options, and acts even though there’s something meaningful at stake. In this vignette, Mickey’s decision to pick orange is totally casual. There’s no pressure, no visible risk, no sign he’s venturing out of his comfort zone in a way that might matter later. Look for scenes where the character’s choice affects their day, reputation, or relationships if you want true medium potency.

If you select HIGH:
Nope. A high-potency decision would be dramatic and possibly life-altering: think quitting a job, ending a relationship, confessing a secret, or risking something that can’t be undone. There’d be hesitation, tension, or even dread—and the story would change course in a big way. Mickey’s soda pick is about as low-stakes as it gets. No matter what happens, his world stays exactly the same.

2. Desire — Low Potency
Vignette:
Wendy wandered through the bookstore, dragging her fingers along the dusty spines. She wasn’t looking for anything in particular—maybe just something to pass the time before the bus. A display of cheap paperbacks caught her eye. A romance novel with a cartoonish cover, nothing like what she’d normally read. She picked it up, flipped a few pages, and grinned at a corny line. Did she want it? Not really. But as she carried it to the register, she thought, maybe she just wanted something new, even if it was silly—a small distraction, nothing more, nothing less.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
Correct! This is a textbook low-potency desire. Wendy’s interest in the book is casual and passing. She’s not desperate to have it, not aching or anxious, not even planning to read it for a deep reason—she just wants a distraction while waiting for the bus. There’s no emotional urgency or risk of loss; if the book disappeared, her day would go on unchanged. Low-potency desires help fill out characters and make them feel human—they show the small wants and impulses that make up everyday life, not the obsessions or needs that drive a story forward.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium-potency desires are the ones that motivate a character to act with purpose—there’s usually something at stake or an emotion attached (wanting to reconnect, to prove themselves, or to take a risk). Here, Wendy’s “want” is barely a want at all; she’s mostly curious and a little bored. If you want to spot medium-potency desires, look for longing, meaningful risks, or personal consequences.

If you select HIGH:
No. High-potency desires are the kind that consume a character: burning obsessions, powerful hungers, or desperate needs. In those scenes, everything else falls away, and the character would give up almost anything to satisfy the desire. Wendy’s barely aware she wants the book at all, and if she lost it, she wouldn’t care. That’s what makes this low potency.

3. Desire — Medium Potency
Vignette:
Jonah scrolled through old photos on his phone—friends at the lake, arms around each other, faces sunburned and wild. He hesitated, thumb hovering over Casey’s number. They hadn’t talked since the fallout, but the urge to fix things kept buzzing in his chest. Maybe tonight, maybe now, he’d send a message and risk the silence that might follow. More than anything, he just wanted his friend back, even if it meant swallowing his pride.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
Exactly right! This is medium-potency desire in action. Jonah really wants something—his friend back—and that desire drives him to consider taking a risk (reaching out, risking rejection, swallowing his pride). The stakes are emotional and personal; this longing could change his mood or their relationship, but it won’t reshape his life or identity completely. Medium desires push characters out of comfort and toward vulnerability, but they don’t always result in drastic or irreversible consequences. These moments are the heart of much drama and friendship in fiction.

If you select LOW:
Not quite. Low-potency desires are background wants, fleeting impulses, or things a character wouldn’t miss if they never got them. Here, Jonah’s need isn’t trivial; it nags at him, shapes his thoughts, and prompts hesitation. If the outcome mattered less, if he was just a little nostalgic, it would be low. But this is more than that.

If you select HIGH:
No. High-potency desires are obsessive or desperate—the character would do almost anything, maybe cross a line or risk everything, to satisfy the urge. In this scene, Jonah’s desire is meaningful and a bit risky, but it’s not all-consuming or life-defining. He could live without Casey, even if it would hurt.

4. Desire — High Potency
Vignette:
Allison stared at the glowing hospital monitor. She pressed her forehead to the glass, whispering his name. If sheer wanting could bring someone back, he’d be awake already. Her world had shrunk to this room, this hope, this impossible hunger for a miracle—she would give anything just to see him open his eyes.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
That’s it! This is high-potency desire at its most intense. Allison’s need is desperate, urgent, and eclipses everything else. She would give up anything—her whole world is narrowed down to a single wish. In high-potency desire, the stakes are everything: the character’s happiness, purpose, or sense of self hangs in the balance. These are the moments that drive stories forward, force characters to act, or even break them down. Allison’s longing is all-consuming, making this a textbook example.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium-potency desires matter and may cause characters to take risks or feel exposed, but they don’t consume everything. If Allison could have shrugged and gone home, or if this desire was just for comfort, it would be medium. Here, it’s the kind of need that makes you ache to read or write.

If you select LOW:
No. Low-potency desires are background, nearly optional, and easy to forget. Allison’s desire is the only thing in her world right now—she’s desperate for a miracle, not just passing time or chasing distraction.

Vignette:
From Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen:

“Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter. The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground... Her mind was busily forming her own wishes as to the comfort and elegance of the house, but it was only a faint and idle curiosity—nothing more than the pleasure of seeing something new.”

Cited: Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice, Chapter 43 (1813, public domain)

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
Exactly! This is a low-potency desire. Elizabeth’s interest is described as “a faint and idle curiosity”—she’s not even sure she really wants anything. It’s simply the light pleasure of seeing something unfamiliar. If the visit had been canceled, she would have gone on with her life unchanged. Low-potency desires are the passing daydreams, idle wishes, or small curiosities that fill up real life but don’t steer the story. These help set tone, mood, or setting, but they don’t create real tension or risk. It’s not about need or longing; it’s just an “it would be nice” kind of feeling.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium-potency desire would give Elizabeth a want strong enough to prompt her to act, take a chance, or risk embarrassment. Maybe she’d scheme for a better view, or wish so deeply for the house that it shaped her next choice. But here, her “desire” is just a little flutter of interest.

If you select HIGH:
No. High-potency desire means obsession, desperation, or aching need—something Elizabeth simply doesn’t feel here. The difference is night and day: high-potency wants drive a character’s every move. This is just mild curiosity.

Vignette:
From Great Expectations by Charles Dickens:

"I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me, than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection... Estella, to the last hour of my life, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good in me, part of the evil..."

Cited: Charles Dickens, Great Expectations, Chapter 44 (1861, public domain)

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
Absolutely! This is high-potency desire at its most intense and destructive. Pip’s longing for Estella is obsessive and self-defeating—he loves her despite knowing it hurts him, despite knowing it will never be returned the way he wants. This kind of desire shapes his entire identity and colors his world view. In stories, high-potency desire isn’t just a plot point, it’s the fuel for everything a character does, often leading to heartbreak, transformation, or disaster. Pip’s words make it clear: he can’t stop, no matter how much it hurts him.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium-potency desire is important and often motivates real risk, but it’s not consuming. Pip’s feeling isn’t just about wanting Estella—it’s about needing her so deeply that his whole life is shaped by it. Medium would be if he longed for her but could still move on.

If you select LOW:
No. Low-potency desire is a passing fancy or a want that doesn’t hurt to lose. Pip’s is an obsession—he’d give up happiness, peace, and maybe even self-respect for her. That’s the definition of high potency.

7. Stakes — Low Potency
Vignette:
Marcus stared at the microwave, waiting for his popcorn to finish. If he pulled the bag out too soon, it’d be half kernels; wait too long, it’d burn. He hovered by the beep, finger poised to stop it. Not life or death, but no one likes burnt popcorn for movie night.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
That’s right! The stakes here are incredibly low. The only thing Marcus risks is whether his popcorn comes out perfect or disappointing. The outcome is minor—a small comfort or annoyance, not something that would shape his night, let alone his life. Low stakes are about inconvenience, comfort, or pride, not relationships, safety, or dreams. These moments add realism and sometimes humor, but they don’t create drama.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium stakes would mean Marcus risks more: maybe impressing a guest, salvaging a date, or avoiding a small but real embarrassment. Here, the risk is limited to his own snack.

If you select HIGH:
Nope. High stakes would make this a crisis—maybe the popcorn is for a contest or is all he has to eat. Nothing like that is true here. This is as low stakes as it gets: popcorn for movie night.

8. Stakes — Medium Potency
Vignette:
Nina checked her email for the third time, heart thumping. The audition callback list was going out today. If her name wasn’t there, she’d spend another year in this cramped apartment, waiting tables and watching her friends land roles she only dreamed of... If she made it, everything could change. If not, it was back to square one.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
Correct! These are medium-level stakes: important to Nina’s hopes and sense of self, but not life-or-death. If she gets the callback, her career might start—if not, she’s stuck in the same grind, dealing with disappointment and frustration. Medium stakes mean something real is at risk (dreams, reputation, happiness), but there’s room to recover and try again. In many stories, medium stakes create tension and growth, as the character pushes against resistance but won’t be destroyed by failure.

If you select LOW:
Not quite. Low stakes would mean Nina just feels a little sad if she doesn’t get the callback, with no real effect on her life. Here, there’s anxiety, longing, and a sense that this opportunity matters.

If you select HIGH:
No. High stakes would put something irreplaceable or existential at risk—safety, family, love, or a unique chance. Nina has other chances, and her world won’t collapse, but her dream feels a little further away.

Vignette:
“I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself... I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not mad—as I am now... There I plant my foot.”

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
Yes—this is as high-stakes as it gets. Jane is risking everything: her love, her home, her future, and even her sanity, all to remain true to herself. If she walks away, she loses her comfort, the man she loves, and perhaps her place in society. If she stays, she loses her self-respect and identity. These are the stakes that define a character forever—there is no easy way back, and the consequences are profound. In classic literature, these moments make or break a hero. Jane’s choice here is the heart of the whole novel.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium stakes are about something meaningful (like an opportunity or reputation), but Jane is putting her whole self on the line. If she chose wrongly, her life would be fundamentally changed.

If you select LOW:
No. Low stakes are annoyances or discomforts, the things you can shrug off later. Jane’s “planting her foot” means she may lose everything but her soul. That’s as high as stakes can go.

10. Stakes — Low Potency (Public Domain)
Vignette:
"We got out the boat and went for a bathe before breakfast, and then we set to work to get breakfast. We wanted to clean the kettle, but we could not find anything to clean it with. George suggested sand. We went and got some sand, but it was rather moist, and stuck to the kettle. Then George suggested that we should scrape it out with a stick. Harris said he thought it would be just as easy to clean it with a stone. So George went out and got a large flint, and began to hammer at the inside of the kettle with it, and at every blow he gave he knocked in a little bit of the kettle.

We had made up our minds to have some tea, so we washed out the kettle as best we could, filled it with water, and put it on to boil. But no tea had we. We all searched our pockets and bags for the tea. At last, Harris unearthed a paper parcel, and we sighed with relief. We had tea after all."

Cited: Jerome K. Jerome, Three Men in a Boat, Chapter 5 (1889, public domain)

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
Absolutely correct. This is a prime example of low-potency stakes. Take a step back and ask: what’s really at risk here? Nothing crucial, nothing emotional, nothing lasting. The group faces the small, comic inconvenience of possibly missing out on their morning tea. At most, they’ll be slightly annoyed or disappointed—but their friendship, future, and happiness are untouched. Even if things go badly, it’s a story to laugh about later. The whole episode is played for humor, using exaggerated fuss over something trivial, which is a common way writers inject realism and levity into stories. When you see characters puzzling over everyday mishaps—missing tea, burnt toast, a lost sock—the stakes are usually low. No one’s self-worth, dreams, or relationships are on the line; it’s just a hiccup in the day.

How to spot it: Look for scenes where “failure” results in a momentary annoyance, but life rolls on. The characters are not forced to change, and there’s no real tension. The mood is often light or comic, and the solution, when found, brings relief but not transformation.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium stakes would mean something real is at risk—an opportunity, reputation, or maybe a relationship. Here, the worst outcome is a breakfast without tea. The group feels relieved when the tea is found, but they would have carried on if they hadn’t found it. If you find yourself thinking, “Well, this is annoying, but I’ll get over it,” you’re likely looking at low rather than medium stakes.

If you select HIGH:
No. High stakes transform characters or worlds—failure can mean loss of love, identity, freedom, or even life. In this scene, no such outcomes are possible. The kettle’s state and the tea’s location make for funny banter, not real risk. If you sense that the tension is fleeting and everyone can laugh about it, the stakes are low.

11. Stakes — Medium Potency
Vignette:
Sylvia glanced at the clock—five minutes left in the exam. Sweat beaded on her forehead as she reread the final question, the one she couldn’t afford to miss. Passing meant keeping her scholarship and her spot on the team; failing would mean awkward calls home, maybe a part-time job, maybe not returning next semester. She erased another shaky answer, mind racing with half-remembered formulas. All around her, pencils scratched and chairs creaked. The pressure pressed in, heavier than she’d expected. When the teacher called time, Sylvia scribbled her best guess and handed in the test, hoping it was enough.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
Perfect—this is a classic medium-stakes scenario. Sylvia faces the real possibility of her life changing, but it’s not life or death, and she isn’t about to lose herself. The outcome matters—a failed exam could mean losing her scholarship, having tough conversations with her family, and even changing her living situation or future plans. Still, there’s room to recover, try again, or find another path. Medium stakes drive personal tension and create relatable drama: a sense of urgency that gets the reader’s heart pounding, but not a total disaster. This is the bread and butter of contemporary and coming-of-age fiction, where what’s at risk is big enough to change a character’s circumstances but not so big that it defines their destiny.

How to spot it: Ask if the character could bounce back with effort, even if things go wrong. Do the stakes hit home—reputation, opportunity, pride, or security—without changing the very core of who they are? Does the character’s world feel like it might shrink, but not disappear, if they fail? That’s medium.

If you select LOW:
Not quite. Low stakes wouldn’t make Sylvia sweat. If failing meant little more than embarrassment or a single missed opportunity with no real fallout, the tension wouldn’t be here. In this vignette, the outcome affects her finances, her athletics, her future, and her relationship with her family. That’s too much to call “low.”

If you select HIGH:
No. High stakes mean an existential risk—loss of self, irreplaceable love, safety, or a single shot at something that will never come again. Sylvia’s situation is stressful, but she has other options. Even if things go badly, her life isn’t over—she can recover and rebuild. That’s what keeps the stakes at medium.

12. Conflict — Low Potency (Public Domain)
Vignette:
"Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged."

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
Spot on! This is a textbook low-potency conflict. Tom is facing a task he hates—whitewashing a huge fence. The conflict here is mostly internal: he’s annoyed, discouraged, and overwhelmed by the sheer size of the job. But nothing essential is at risk. If Tom quits, the worst consequence is a scolding or missing out on fun. The moment is filled with sighs and melodrama, but it’s ordinary, everyday frustration—not a crisis or a showdown. These conflicts make stories feel grounded and relatable, letting readers see characters struggle with the little obstacles and moods that pepper real life.

How to spot it:
Look for a conflict where the only casualty is mood or motivation—no real relationships, futures, or reputations are in danger. Low conflicts often reveal character (Tom’s laziness and creativity) and set up bigger problems, but on their own, they’re just blips.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium conflicts create tension between characters or with systems: arguments, rivalries, rules that push back, or situations where the outcome really matters to the character. Here, Tom is alone, wrestling with boredom and work, not another person or a real loss.

If you select HIGH:
No. High-potency conflict is about survival, betrayal, violence, or moments when everything could be lost. Tom’s only fighting his own gloom and a fence. That’s as low as it gets in fiction.

13. Conflict — Medium Potency
Vignette:
The meeting room fell silent as Rosa slid her proposal across the table. Evan, arms crossed, shook his head. “We’ve already tried it your way,” he muttered. Their manager glanced between them, tension rising. Rosa clenched her jaw—this wasn’t just a disagreement; it was her chance to prove herself.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
Exactly! This is a strong example of medium-potency conflict. The tension is visible—two coworkers at odds over a proposal, under the eye of a manager. There’s more than annoyance at stake: Rosa is fighting to prove herself, and the outcome could affect her reputation, self-esteem, and future opportunities at work. The conflict is personal and social, not just internal. Medium conflicts drive the story forward by challenging characters’ goals, beliefs, and relationships. There’s no immediate danger or betrayal, but the friction is real and the risk is meaningful.

How to spot it:
Ask: Is this a “push comes to shove” moment? Is someone’s pride, opportunity, or standing at risk? Do characters have to make choices about how to respond? If yes, you’re in medium territory.

If you select LOW:
Not quite. Low conflict would mean a quick spat or a minor irritation—something that passes quickly and leaves no mark. Here, Rosa’s chance to prove herself is at stake, and the tension hangs in the air, shaping what comes next.

If you select HIGH:
No. High conflict means threats, betrayals, or losses that could change everything. In this room, no one is in physical danger, and the relationships can recover. The risk is personal, but not life-altering.

14. Conflict — High Potency
Vignette:
Lightning flashed as Lena pressed herself against the locked door, fists pounding. On the other side, her brother shouted for her to let him in, but she shook her head, tears streaming. Downstairs, footsteps thundered up the stairs—the intruder was close. Lena’s heart hammered as she fumbled with the key, desperate to save them both. Her brother’s voice broke, pleading, “Please, Lena!” The door wouldn’t budge. She had seconds to choose—risk it all, or lose everything.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
Absolutely—this is high-potency conflict in full force. Every second counts, and the consequences are dire: life or death, safety or disaster. Lena is up against an immediate, external threat (the intruder), but also torn by her brother’s pleas and her own fear. The choices she makes in this moment will define her and could result in irreversible loss. High-conflict scenes usually involve danger, betrayal, or a crisis that puts everything—relationships, identity, or existence—on the line. The tension is nearly unbearable because the stakes are total: win or lose, the world won’t be the same.

How to spot it:
If you feel a knot in your stomach reading or writing it—if you wonder what you would do in that split second, with no good choices—this is high conflict. Everything is at risk, and the character may have to act against their own wishes, values, or heart.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium conflict is heated and meaningful, but not catastrophic. If Lena and her brother were arguing about chores or college, it would be medium. Here, lives are at risk and there’s no easy way out.

If you select LOW:
No. Low conflict is about frustration, inconvenience, or mild tension. Nothing in this moment is small—the pressure, the danger, and the stakes are overwhelming.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
Exactly right—this is a low-potency conflict. The Queen’s bizarre declaration is more farce than fight: the tension comes from absurdity, not actual danger. Alice isn’t facing harm or betrayal—she’s confronting nonsense, and while it’s annoying, it doesn’t seriously threaten her. Low conflicts like this serve to create mood, satirize authority, or amuse the reader. They show a character up against a petty rule or an illogical obstacle—nothing that will leave a scar. To spot low conflict, look for situations where the stakes are negligible and the mood is playful, satirical, or routine rather than tense or threatening.

If you select MEDIUM:
Choosing medium for this one isn’t quite right, but it’s easy to see why. Medium conflict involves real pushback or emotional charge—perhaps an argument where someone’s pride, reputation, or plans are at risk, or a standoff that will shape how characters see each other. Here, the Queen is being ridiculous, but Alice isn’t deeply invested, afraid, or likely to suffer any lasting harm from the exchange. If the scene included a threat to her safety or standing, or if Alice cared desperately about the outcome, the conflict would rise to medium.

If you select HIGH:
Selecting high means you’re expecting danger, betrayal, or something irreversible on the line—this isn’t one of those moments. High conflict shakes the world: someone’s future, identity, or survival is at stake, with emotional weight to match. In Wonderland, many moments feel “off,” but unless Alice is actually threatened (which does happen elsewhere), the mood is playful and odd, not desperate or dire. If there’s no chance of permanent loss or a fundamental change in the character, it’s not high.

Vignette:
Jo’s temper was decidedly tried this morning, for she was late and in a hurry... snatching the book, she ran off without waiting to hear Amy’s loud lamentations and repeated demands for her property... Amy set her small mind to work on the mischief to which she had been prompted by Jo’s disrespect.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
Exactly—this is medium-potency conflict. Jo and Amy’s clash is heated and meaningful. The stakes are higher than mere inconvenience: pride, respect, and the dynamic between sisters are on the line. There’s clear pushback, emotional fallout, and consequences that last beyond the moment (Amy’s plans for mischief, Jo’s rush, the echo of anger). Medium conflict often involves personal relationships—people we care about, situations that matter, or arguments that reveal character. It’s not just about being annoyed; it’s about being changed, at least a little. To spot medium conflict, look for moments when characters butt heads or struggle over something important to them, even if it isn’t life-changing.

If you select LOW:
This scene goes deeper than low-potency conflict. While it starts with an everyday mistake (the wrong book), the argument escalates. Amy’s feelings are hurt, Jo is angry, and there’s a sense that the relationship takes a hit, even temporarily. Low conflict would resolve quickly, with no lasting emotion or change. Here, you can feel the tension between them, and it promises to shape what they do next. When a scene leaves emotional marks, even small ones, it’s more than low.

If you select HIGH:
Calling this high-potency conflict overstates the risk and emotional weight. High conflict in fiction means the possibility of losing something irreplaceable—love, safety, or self. Even though Jo and Amy are upset, there’s no threat of permanent estrangement, physical danger, or a break they can’t heal. This is a fight, not a fracture: their bond will recover, and no one is in peril. Save “high” for moments where the outcome could reshape the characters’ world forever.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
That’s right—this is a low-potency decision. Huck makes his choice casually, without hesitation or risk. The decision barely shifts the plot or his life: if he changed his mind, nothing meaningful would be lost or gained. Low-potency decisions like this pepper real life and fiction alike, helping build rhythm and normalcy. Look for choices where the character acts on a whim, by habit, or without consequences. These moments set the stage for bigger moves but don’t demand courage, reflection, or sacrifice.

If you select MEDIUM:
Choosing medium is understandable but not quite a fit here. Medium decisions matter to the character, causing tension or requiring them to weigh options. If Huck were torn between risking his safety or betraying a friend, the scene would shift to medium. Instead, his choice is offhand—he just feels like finding Jim. No pulse-quickening stakes or inner struggle is present. For medium, look for hesitation, emotional risk, or the sense that a relationship or opportunity could be lost.

If you select HIGH:
Labeling this high suggests a dramatic turning point, a moment with no return. Huck’s simple plan isn’t risky or transformative. High-potency decisions force characters to gamble with what they value most—love, safety, or their own identity. Here, Huck’s just planning his day, with no fear or dread in sight. Unless a decision threatens to change a life, it’s not high.

Vignette:
Monica paused outside the thrift store, paycheck in hand. The jacket in the window—red leather, wild and gaudy—called to her. She bit her lip. Buy it, and ramen for a week. Walk away, and regret it forever. With a nervous laugh, she went inside, reaching for the hanger.

Quiz:

High

Medium

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
Exactly. This is a medium-potency decision. Monica’s choice isn’t life-or-death, but it’s loaded with emotion and risk: buying the jacket means sacrifice and a whole week of cheap food; not buying means missing out on something that excites her. She hesitates and weighs the cost—hallmarks of medium potency. These choices shape how characters feel about themselves and their future, even if they don’t alter their entire world. Watch for scenes where the choice lingers in the character’s mind and has real, personal consequences, even if they’re not permanent.

If you select LOW:
Not quite. Low-potency decisions require little thought or risk. If Monica could have bought the jacket without a second thought, or if she didn’t care either way, it would be low. Here, she’s torn—her decision comes with discomfort and the possibility of regret. If you see a character forced to pause and wrestle with options, you’re likely in medium territory.

If you select HIGH:
Choosing high would mean seeing this decision as life-altering or irreversible. While Monica’s choice is meaningful, it won’t define her fate or change her core self. High-potency decisions are the kind you can’t undo—ending a relationship, quitting a job, confessing a secret that could ruin everything. Buying a jacket, even a special one, doesn’t have that power.

Vignette:
“Once more,” said Marner, “do you want to stay with me, or would you like to go with that lady?” ... “I want to stay with you, father,” said Eppie, with trembling lips... The decision was made, and its weight settled over the room.

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
Correct—this is a high-potency decision, one that changes everything. Eppie’s choice is no everyday moment or small risk. She’s being asked to pick between two families, two futures—one filled with wealth and social standing, the other with the only love she’s ever known. The consequences are lifelong and permanent. The story, and the lives of everyone in the room, will never be the same. High-potency decisions carry the weight of identity, loyalty, and selfhood: the kind of crossroads people remember forever. In literature and life, these are the decisions that define us, and the tension in this scene is a direct result of what’s at stake.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium-potency decisions have emotional risk or require sacrifice, but don’t rewrite a character’s life. If Eppie were just choosing a school or a place to live for the summer, this would be medium. Instead, her answer determines her family, her sense of belonging, and her future. When the outcome of a choice will echo forever, the potency is high. Watch for scenes where no matter what the character picks, nothing can ever go back to how it was.

If you select LOW:
Low isn’t right for this scene. Low-potency decisions are casual or minor—small choices a character could make and forget, with no big consequences. Eppie’s choice isn’t just about the present moment; it will shape the rest of her life. If the atmosphere is charged, the adults are anxious, and the future is on the line, you’re far above low.

20. Decision — Low Potency (Original, 100 words)
Vignette:
Avery stood at the crosswalk, sneakers tapping out an anxious beat. On one side: the same old route to work, predictable and dull. On the other: a side street she’d never walked, with ivy-tangled fences and unfamiliar faces. She hesitated, coffee cooling in her hand. Why not? It was just a different way to the same job. Still, her stomach fluttered as she stepped off the curb, turning left instead of right for once. The morning air felt different, and as she walked past sunlit porches and chattering sparrows, Avery wondered what else she might do differently, just for today.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
That’s it—this is low-potency all the way. Avery’s choice is small and experimental, the kind of harmless risk that most people take from time to time. Nothing important is on the line. There’s no threat of loss or deep transformation; she’s just curious about a different street. Low-potency decisions like this make characters feel real and present in the world, giving us a taste of how even little changes can shift a mood or a day, but not a life. To spot these moments, look for choices that are all about the now, with no ripple effect beyond the next cup of coffee.

If you select MEDIUM:
Medium would require the choice to have some emotional or practical risk—a fear of missing out, a chance to meet someone, or the possibility of embarrassment or regret. Avery’s route is new, but her life will be unchanged at the end of it. If there’s no need for her to weigh the options beyond mild curiosity, and if nothing will truly be gained or lost, it’s not medium.

If you select HIGH:
Nope. High-potency decisions change the character’s future or identity. If Avery’s new route took her to a city she’d never seen again, or led her to a life-changing encounter, maybe. Here, the risk is zero and the outcome is trivial. High-potency is all about major forks in the road—not strolls down side streets.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
Right! This is a classic high-potency decision—choosing love and loyalty over wealth and comfort, knowing there’s no going back. The character is risking everything for her own truth: leaving riches and the safety of privilege for emotional fulfillment, or maybe even survival. These moments define the character’s arc, marking the boundary between what they could have and what they truly value. In stories, these high-stakes decisions test a character’s courage and reshape their life. You can spot high-potency when a decision demands that a character give up comfort, security, or even their old self for what matters most.

If you select MEDIUM:
This isn’t quite medium. Medium-potency would mean the choice has consequences, but nothing this big—maybe risking embarrassment, comfort, or social standing, but not survival or the loss of love. The difference here is the all-or-nothing stakes: she leaves behind an easy life for something deeper, possibly at great cost. If you see a decision where “everything changes” depending on the answer, you’re probably dealing with high potency.

If you select LOW:
Low falls short here. Low-potency decisions are about the ordinary—what to eat, which book to read, which way to walk. This decision is all heart and sacrifice; it costs her something she’ll never get back. When you see “leave it all behind,” you can bet the stakes are high.

22. Change — Low Potency (Public Domain, 10 words)

“He began to whistle. It was his new habit.”

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
You got it—this is a low-potency change. Tom’s new habit, whistling, is a small shift in behavior that doesn’t shake up his life or his relationships. These little changes help make characters feel alive and believable: the way a person might start drinking coffee in the mornings or picking up a new catchphrase. There’s no risk, no drama, no one else affected. Low-potency change adds texture to the story world without altering its course. If the character could drop this habit tomorrow and be the same person, you’re looking at low.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium-potency change means a clear, meaningful shift: the character makes a decision, or their behavior starts affecting others. Tom’s new habit doesn’t matter to anyone and isn’t the result of a choice with consequences. When the change is significant but not world-altering, it’s medium; here, it’s just background.

If you select HIGH:
High is a stretch here. High-potency change is about transformation: a character’s identity, beliefs, or relationships get turned upside down. Tom’s whistling is just a detail—no one’s world is rocked, not even his. If everything stays the same except for a little habit, it’s low.

23. Change — Medium Potency (Public Domain, ~200 words)
Vignette:
“Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her former assertions. Sufficient proof of her change of sentiment appeared on the very day of Mr. Knightley’s return... That evening, Emma walked alone in the garden, feeling the difference in her heart and the world around her. She found herself wishing for what she once denied. She smiled at the stars, knowing life was shifting quietly, and she was not afraid.”
Cited: Jane Austen, Emma, Volume III, Chapter XIII (1815, public domain, condensed)

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
Exactly—this is medium-potency change. Emma’s shift is clearly noticeable: her feelings about Mr. Knightley have evolved, and she recognizes a new warmth in herself. This change matters to her story and her emotional world—it affects her actions and the way she relates to others. However, it isn’t a total reinvention or a dramatic reversal. Medium changes often build gradually, with characters realizing they’ve outgrown old beliefs or are ready for something new. You can spot medium potency when a change prompts characters to act differently or approach life in a new way, but doesn’t erase who they were or demand a complete transformation.

If you select LOW:
Not quite. Low-potency changes are the tiny, everyday shifts—a new habit, a passing mood, or a minor preference. If Emma’s only difference was a momentary smile or an idle thought, it would be low. Here, though, her feelings for Mr. Knightley genuinely alter how she behaves and what she wants. It’s a personal, meaningful change that influences the course of her story. When you see a character moving beyond the surface and letting their new perspective shape their world, it’s more than low.

If you select HIGH:
This doesn’t reach high. High-potency change means a character’s identity, values, or life path are fundamentally and irrevocably altered. If Emma were renouncing her old life entirely, breaking off from her community, or being “born again” in spirit, that would be high. Here, she grows and softens, but stays herself—a medium shift, not a seismic one. Look for big, permanent ruptures to call something high potency.

Vignette:
“Gregory turned and walked away from the house for the last time, the keys cold in his hand. He looked back only once. Everything he’d known—family, fortune, even his name—was finished. In their place, a hard-won freedom, strange and raw, grew inside him as he disappeared into the city.”

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
Absolutely—this is high-potency change. Gregory leaves behind his entire old life: family, fortune, and even identity. It’s not just a mood shift or a new routine; it’s a rupture with the past and a leap into the unknown. High-potency change always feels irreversible—the character can’t go back, even if they wanted to. Their relationships, circumstances, and sense of self are all transformed. In stories, these moments mark new beginnings, endings, or rebirths, and often close one chapter while opening another. When a change leaves someone unrecognizable to their old self or community, it’s high.

If you select MEDIUM:
This is bigger than medium. Medium-potency change affects how a character thinks, feels, or behaves, but doesn’t wipe the slate clean. If Gregory were just moving houses, or reconciling with an old friend, that would be medium. Here, the break is total: his old world is gone, and his future will be nothing like his past. If you sense the character has crossed a line with no return, the potency is high.

If you select LOW:
Low can’t capture the scale of this moment. Low-potency change is about tiny, incremental adjustments—small habits, a slightly different outlook, or a temporary feeling. Gregory’s transformation is existential; it leaves everything before it behind. High-potency change is the moment in a story you remember long after, because nothing is ever the same again.

25. Change — Low Potency (Public Domain, 175 words)
Vignette:
“Mrs. March came quietly in, and stood beside her, saying nothing. Amy felt comforted, though she didn’t know why. Presently she put her hand in her mother’s, and said softly, ‘I’m glad you came. I was feeling cross and selfish, and I wanted to be alone; but I think I should like to stay with you now.’
Mrs. March drew her close, and, with a smile, said, ‘My dear, you are growing up.’
Amy nestled against her, feeling peaceful for the first time all day. Nothing remarkable had happened—no grand apologies or confessions—but something inside Amy shifted. She no longer wanted to shut everyone out or cling to her small grievances. She simply sat with her mother, the quiet room warming her heart.
Later, as Amy watched the sunset, she realized she hadn’t thought about herself for a whole hour. It felt new, and good. She smiled, thinking, ‘Perhaps I am changing, after all.’”

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
That’s right—this is low-potency change. Amy’s shift is internal and gentle: she goes from sulking to a quiet, peaceful connection with her mother. There’s no big declaration, no dramatic fallout, and nothing permanent at stake. These moments are subtle, often unnoticed by other characters, and mostly just make life a bit smoother for the person experiencing them. Low-potency change is about the small, sometimes fleeting ways people grow or soften—an hour of kindness, a moment of perspective. If a character could easily return to their old self with a change in circumstance, you’re seeing a low-potency change.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium-potency change leaves a mark that lasts longer and shapes future choices. If Amy’s new mood led her to act differently for weeks, or to mend a rift, that would move it to medium. Here, it’s a brief shift in mood and attitude—a relief for her and a warm moment for the story, but not something that will rewrite who she is.

If you select HIGH:
No, this isn’t high. High-potency change rewrites the character’s story or sense of self. Amy’s shift is quiet and easily reversed—if something else upset her tomorrow, she might slip right back into her old habits. High-potency is for the big transformations: losing faith, changing sides, starting a new life. This is a small, honest step forward.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
You’re spot on—this is high-potency change, distilled to its essence. The phrase “born again” isn’t just about a new habit or mood; it’s about a complete transformation. In this context, the character’s old life, beliefs, and identity are left behind, replaced by something utterly new. These moments are rare and powerful in fiction, marking the true climax of a story or a character’s arc. If you see language like “born again,” “never the same,” or “a new life begins,” you’re looking at the highest level of change.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium-potency change might mean a character thinks differently or acts with new purpose, but they’re still fundamentally themselves. Here, “born again” means total renewal, as if the character has become someone else—something medium potency just doesn’t cover. If the language is this absolute, the change is high.

If you select LOW:
This isn’t low. Low-potency change is about a shift in mood or a small tweak to daily life. “He is born again” is too powerful and sweeping for that: everything before is erased, and everything after is new. That’s as high-potency as change gets.

27. Desire — Low Potency (Public Domain, 200 words)
Vignette:
“Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.
With delight she turned her eyes to the house, and scarcely dared lift them as they approached. Her mind was busily forming her own wishes as to the comfort and elegance of the house, but it was only a faint and idle curiosity—nothing more than the pleasure of seeing something new.”
Cited: Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice, Chapter 43 (1813, public domain, condensed)

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
Absolutely right—this is a low-potency desire. Elizabeth is experiencing curiosity and a soft pleasure at the newness and beauty of her surroundings. She’s not burning with longing or even forming a plan to get what she wants. Her wish is almost daydream-like—if she never visited again or if nothing came of the visit, it wouldn’t trouble her. In stories, low-potency desire is used to show a character’s openness to experience or their capacity for appreciation, but it doesn’t steer the plot or put anything at risk. You can spot these scenes by looking for wants that are quickly forgotten or that don’t demand action from the character.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium-potency desire is when a character is motivated to act or take a risk because of what they want. Elizabeth is only passively forming “faint and idle” wishes; she’s not weighing options, planning a move, or suffering any kind of longing. If her interest became a hope that moved her to do or say something, then the desire would rise to medium.

If you select HIGH:
This isn’t high at all. High-potency desire is an obsession—a longing that overrides caution or sense, that drives the character to chase what they want even at real risk. Elizabeth is simply enjoying the view, not fighting to possess the house or changing her life over it. If the desire can be shrugged off with a new distraction, it’s low.

"I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me, than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection... Estella, to the last hour of my life, you cannot choose but remain part of my character..."

Quiz:

High

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
That’s it—this is pure high-potency desire. Pip’s love for Estella is unreasoning, all-consuming, and persistent even in the face of pain, disappointment, and logic. His longing is so deep it becomes part of his identity, shaping who he is and how he sees the world. High-potency desire is always obsessive: it doesn’t matter if the object is attainable or even healthy. This kind of want drives stories forward, leading to both triumph and disaster. If a character would trade anything or endure anything just for a chance to fulfill this desire, you’re seeing high potency.

If you select MEDIUM:
This isn’t medium. Medium-potency desire motivates action and comes with risk, but it doesn’t devour the character or define their being. Pip’s attachment is beyond longing or hope; it becomes almost a curse. If you sense a desire is hurting the character as much as helping them, and it persists no matter what, you’re well into high-potency territory.

If you select LOW:
Definitely not low. Low-potency desire is about fleeting wants or simple pleasures—a character might like or enjoy something, but they’ll move on quickly. Pip’s obsession with Estella lingers for years, shaping the story itself. When desire is this persistent and self-defeating, it’s always high.

Vignette:
Marcus stared at the microwave, waiting for his popcorn to finish. If he pulled the bag out too soon, it’d be half kernels; wait too long, it’d burn. He hovered by the beep, finger poised to stop it. Not life or death, but no one likes burnt popcorn for movie night.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
Correct—this is the definition of low-potency stakes. The only thing Marcus stands to lose is a perfect snack. It’s a small annoyance at worst, not something that will ruin his evening, reputation, or relationships. In fiction, low-stakes moments are often used to show the everyday world, provide comic relief, or slow down the pace before higher-stakes scenes. When a character’s only risk is a minor inconvenience or discomfort, it’s low. Look for scenes where even failure is easily shrugged off, and nothing lasting is at risk.

If you select MEDIUM:
Medium stakes would mean Marcus is risking something more significant—maybe impressing a guest, making a date go well, or needing the popcorn as his only food. Here, it’s just about popcorn, not his pride or well-being. If the tension is all about comfort or minor pleasure, it’s still low.

If you select HIGH:
This isn’t high by any stretch. High stakes would be life-altering: loss of home, love, or self. Here, Marcus faces the trivial worry of burnt popcorn—hardly a crisis. When the worst-case scenario is a snack that’s a little disappointing, you’re nowhere near high.

30. Stakes — Medium Potency (Original, 100 words)
Vignette:
Nina checked her email for the third time, heart thumping. The audition callback list was going out today. If her name wasn’t there, she’d spend another year in this cramped apartment, waiting tables and watching her friends land roles she only dreamed of. She paced, rehearsing lines just in case, but her confidence wavered—what if her performance wasn’t strong enough, what if she’d blown her only chance? The phone buzzed. Nina stared at the screen, weighing whether to check or keep hoping a little longer. If she made it, everything could change. If not, it was back to square one.

Quiz:

High

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
That’s right—these are medium-potency stakes. Nina is facing a real risk: her future, ambitions, and sense of progress are at stake. If she misses out, it hurts—she has to wait, work, and watch others get ahead. But her life isn’t over, and she has other chances. Medium stakes are about opportunities, dreams, and pride—things that matter deeply, but aren’t absolute. They create relatable tension and drive much of everyday drama. If the worst that can happen is disappointment or another cycle of struggle, but not total ruin, it’s medium.

If you select LOW:
Not quite. Low stakes wouldn’t make Nina anxious. If the audition was just for fun, or she could easily try again tomorrow, there wouldn’t be much to lose. Here, Nina’s future feels tied to this outcome—there’s pressure, hope, and real potential for setback, but not disaster.

If you select HIGH:
This isn’t high. High stakes mean life-changing or one-time opportunities, with no way back—losing a loved one, being exiled, or risking your own identity. Nina’s dreams might be delayed, but her world is still open. The sense of hope, risk, and disappointment is strong, but not total.

31. Stakes — High Potency (Public Domain, ~200 words)
Vignette:
“I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man. I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not mad—as I am now. Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth? They have a worth—so I have always believed; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane—quite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by; there I plant my foot.”

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
Absolutely correct—this is as high-potency as stakes get. Jane faces the risk of losing everything: her principles, her sense of self, her future, and her moral integrity. She is standing on the edge of ruin, emotionally and spiritually, forced to choose between love and conscience. What she decides will determine who she becomes; the cost of failure is the loss of herself. High stakes like this mean a character is confronting choices or risks that change their life, their relationships, and their very soul. Look for moments where the stakes reach the level of identity, survival, or what it means to be true to oneself. When a decision threatens to destroy or redefine the character’s world, you’re looking at high stakes.

If you select MEDIUM:
This isn’t medium. Medium stakes would mean Jane was risking reputation, comfort, or opportunity, but not her sense of self or her core beliefs. Here, if she fails, she loses everything that makes her Jane Eyre: her values, her dignity, her entire future. If the cost is so great that nothing else matters, and the consequences are permanent, it’s high. Medium stakes are high tension but allow for recovery—this moment does not.

If you select LOW:
Not at all. Low stakes are about small annoyances or minor risks—a ruined evening, a social embarrassment, or a bit of lost comfort. In this scene, Jane is weighing her whole future against her deepest principles. The pressure is so intense that even Jane wonders if she’s lost her mind. If the outcome will change someone’s life forever, it can never be low.

"We got out the boat and went for a bathe before breakfast, and then we set to work to get breakfast. We wanted to clean the kettle, but we could not find anything to clean it with. George suggested sand. We went and got some sand, but it was rather moist, and stuck to the kettle. Then George suggested that we should scrape it out with a stick. Harris said he thought it would be just as easy to clean it with a stone. So George went out and got a large flint, and began to hammer at the inside of the kettle with it, and at every blow he gave he knocked in a little bit of the kettle.

We had made up our minds to have some tea, so we washed out the kettle as best we could, filled it with water, and put it on to boil. But no tea had we. We all searched our pockets and bags for the tea. At last, Harris unearthed a paper parcel, and we sighed with relief. We had tea after all."

Quiz:

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
That’s right—this is low-potency stakes. The worst that can happen is breakfast without tea, a dirty kettle, and some comedic frustration. No one’s safety, future, or sense of self is on the line. The mood is light, and the “stakes” are mostly about convenience and comfort. Low-potency stakes keep the story grounded in everyday life and let characters be funny or relatable without the pressure of disaster. Look for these moments where the cost of failure is nothing more than a minor inconvenience and where everyone will soon be laughing about the whole mess.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium stakes would mean a risk to reputation, future opportunities, or a goal that matters in a lasting way. Here, the only risk is a less-than-perfect breakfast, which might be annoying but won’t haunt anyone. If the worst-case scenario is “try again later” or “be mildly annoyed,” it’s still low.

If you select HIGH:
No way. High stakes threaten a character’s future, reputation, love, or even life. There is nothing permanent at risk in this comic scramble for tea. If the only thing on the line is comfort or convenience, you’re nowhere near high.

33. Stakes — Medium Potency (Original, 100 words)
Vignette:
Sylvia glanced at the clock—five minutes left in the exam. Sweat beaded on her forehead as she reread the final question, the one she couldn’t afford to miss. Passing meant keeping her scholarship and her spot on the team; failing would mean awkward calls home, maybe a part-time job, maybe not returning next semester. She erased another shaky answer, mind racing with half-remembered formulas. All around her, pencils scratched and chairs creaked. The pressure pressed in, heavier than she’d expected. When the teacher called time, Sylvia scribbled her best guess and handed in the test, hoping it was enough.

Quiz:

High

Medium

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
Yes—this is classic medium-potency stakes. Sylvia’s entire semester, and maybe her sense of achievement, rests on her performance, but the outcome won’t end her story. She’s risking her scholarship and future plans, which matters deeply, but even if she fails, she has options to rebuild or try again. Medium stakes are all about important opportunities or moments of pressure—there’s a real cost, but it’s not catastrophic. If the situation keeps a character up at night, but won’t destroy them if it goes badly, you’re seeing medium potency.

If you select LOW:
Not quite. Low stakes are about mild inconvenience or brief frustration—a failed quiz, not a make-or-break exam. Here, the result will shape Sylvia’s path for months or years, even if it isn’t final. If the tension is strong, the consequences linger, and the future is changed but not erased, you’re above low.

If you select HIGH:
This doesn’t reach high. High stakes would mean Sylvia could lose her entire future or her sense of self—life-changing, irreversible consequences. Here, she might need to regroup or find a new plan, but her world won’t collapse. Medium stakes matter deeply, but they’re not all-or-nothing.

Vignette:
"Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged."

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
Exactly right—this is low-potency conflict. Tom’s only opponent is the fence and his own boredom. He’s not fighting with another character or struggling to save something that matters deeply. The consequence of failure is mild: maybe he gets in a little trouble, maybe he just stays bored. Low-potency conflict is about the small frustrations and personal struggles that make characters relatable and stories feel lived-in. When the problem is just a chore, a mood, or a routine hassle—and the outcome won’t change much—it’s low.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium conflict requires more at stake: an argument, a rivalry, a real risk of emotional fallout or loss. Tom isn’t clashing with anyone except his own mood and the monotony of work. If his struggle were with a person or if the outcome would change his day in a lasting way, you’d be at medium.

If you select HIGH:
No way. High conflict is about serious threats—betrayal, danger, a crisis where much is at risk. Tom’s situation is irritating but harmless. If you sense the character can walk away unchanged or just slightly annoyed, you’re nowhere near high.

35. Conflict — Medium Potency (Original, 50 words)
Vignette:
The meeting room fell silent as Rosa slid her proposal across the table. Evan, arms crossed, shook his head. “We’ve already tried it your way,” he muttered. Their manager glanced between them, tension rising. Rosa clenched her jaw—this wasn’t just a disagreement; it was her chance to prove herself.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
That’s it—medium-potency conflict. There’s tension, risk, and the chance of real fallout: Rosa’s standing in the team, her pride, and maybe her career trajectory are on the line. The clash isn’t a fight for survival, but it could change how she’s seen or what opportunities she gets. Medium conflict often means characters are pitted against each other or against systems, with consequences that matter but don’t destroy. If the scene’s tension is sharp and can leave lasting marks on relationships or reputation, but not irreparable ones, you’re in the medium zone.

If you select LOW:
Not quite. Low conflict would be a quick, inconsequential disagreement—something both sides forget by lunchtime. Here, the mood and risk are heavier: Rosa has something to prove, and the outcome could shape her path at work. If the tension is more than a momentary blip, you’ve moved past low.

If you select HIGH:
No. High conflict is about do-or-die moments, betrayal, or the threat of loss you can’t come back from. While this scene matters, it’s not life-altering. No one’s safety, freedom, or essential relationships are at stake. Save high for moments when everything could collapse.

36. Conflict — High Potency (Original, 75 words)
Vignette:
Lightning flashed as Lena pressed herself against the locked door, fists pounding. On the other side, her brother shouted for her to let him in, but she shook her head, tears streaming. Downstairs, footsteps thundered up the stairs—the intruder was close. Lena’s heart hammered as she fumbled with the key, desperate to save them both. Her brother’s voice broke, pleading, “Please, Lena!” The door wouldn’t budge. She had seconds to choose—risk it all, or lose everything.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
Absolutely—this is high-potency conflict. Lena’s choices here could lead to disaster or salvation, with lives hanging in the balance. There’s no safe way out, only desperate decisions with permanent consequences. High conflict always feels urgent and irreversible: the stakes are so high that characters are forced to act under pressure, often against their own wishes. Look for scenes where everything—their safety, family, or future—rides on the outcome, and every second matters. That’s high.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium conflict would have risk and tension, but not this level of danger or emotional agony. If Lena and her brother were just arguing, or if the threat was manageable, it would be medium. Here, the crisis is existential—someone could be lost, and trust might never recover.

If you select LOW:
No. Low conflict is about mild obstacles or frustration, where the worst outcome is disappointment. Here, the fear is overwhelming, and the cost of failure could change their lives forever. When you see panic, danger, and split-second choices, you’re deep in high territory.

“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
Exactly—this is low-potency conflict. The Queen’s words are absurd and exasperating, but not actually dangerous to Alice in this moment. The scene is comical and illogical, with no real consequences for anyone. Low conflicts like this often lampoon authority or highlight the weirdness of a world, but the risk is zero. If the outcome doesn’t matter and everyone will move on unchanged, it’s low.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium conflict would be a real clash with consequences—someone’s feelings, reputation, or pride on the line. Here, the Queen is being ridiculous, but Alice isn’t suffering more than momentary irritation. The whole thing is played for laughs, not for tension.

If you select HIGH:
Nope. High conflict is about catastrophe or betrayal, with deep losses at stake. Here, nothing is truly at risk. If the scene would be just as funny with a different punchline, it’s not high.

38. Conflict — Medium Potency (Public Domain, 200 words)
Vignette:
Jo’s temper was decidedly tried this morning, for she was late and in a hurry. In her haste she caught up Amy’s lesson-book instead of her own, and was well on her way to school before she discovered the mistake. She turned back, and ran home for it. Meeting Amy in the hall, she asked for the book.
“You can’t have it,” said Amy, sulkily.
“Why not?”
“I want to use it myself.”
“But I’m late, and I can’t wait.”
“I’ll give it to you by and by.”
“No, you won’t,” returned Jo, angrily; and, snatching the book, she ran off without waiting to hear Amy’s loud lamentations and repeated demands for her property.
“You’ll be sorry for this, Jo March!” Amy called after her, as Jo hurried away. But Jo was not sorry, and did not see Amy’s face, as she turned away from the gate, and, returning home, set her small mind to work on the mischief to which she had been prompted by Jo’s disrespect.
Cited: Louisa May Alcott, Little Women, Chapter 8 (1868, public domain)

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
That’s correct—this is a medium-potency conflict. Jo and Amy’s fight is more than an annoyance: there’s pride, hurt, and the potential for the relationship to suffer, at least for a while. They aren’t just frustrated—they’re angry, and the fallout will last past the moment. Medium conflict usually happens between people who care about each other, and the risk is to the relationship, self-respect, or reputation. If a quarrel could change how characters feel or act for days, not just minutes, it’s medium.

If you select LOW:
Not quite. Low conflict would be an argument that ends with a shrug or a joke—something soon forgotten. Here, Amy is plotting mischief, Jo is upset, and there are real emotions at stake. If a clash leads to lingering tension or shapes what happens next, it’s beyond low.

If you select HIGH:
No. High conflict would be betrayal, danger, or a loss that changes everything. Jo and Amy will get over this eventually, and no one is truly threatened. High is reserved for moments that can’t be undone, not even by time or forgiveness.

“I think I’ll go out, and look for Jim.”
Cited: Mark Twain, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Chapter 8 (1884, public domain)

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
You’re right—this is a low-potency decision. Huck simply decides to go looking for his friend, with no risk or big feelings attached. He’s not struggling, weighing options, or risking anything important; he’s just acting on impulse or routine. In fiction, low-potency decisions move the day along without really moving the story. They show us the normal life of a character, but if you took them out, the character wouldn’t change and the stakes wouldn’t rise. If a character could do something else instead and it wouldn’t matter, you’re looking at a low decision.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium potency would mean Huck is hesitating or that the outcome matters—maybe there’s something at risk, or he’ll have to face someone or something if he acts. Here, he’s just following a whim, without fear or hope for a big payoff. Look for emotional or practical consequences to bump a decision up to medium.

If you select HIGH:
No. High-potency decisions shape the rest of a story. If Huck’s choice here would change his life forever or break a bond, that would be high. Instead, this is about curiosity or routine, not transformation or risk. Save high for when a decision closes doors or changes a life.

40. Decision — Medium Potency (Original, 50 words)
Vignette:
Monica paused outside the thrift store, paycheck in hand. The jacket in the window—red leather, wild and gaudy—called to her. She bit her lip. Buy it, and ramen for a week. Walk away, and regret it forever. With a nervous laugh, she went inside, reaching for the hanger.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
That’s right—this is medium-potency. Monica is making a choice that actually matters to her, even if it’s not life-changing. She feels the risk and the possible regret, and she has to weigh her options: pleasure now, or comfort later. Medium decisions often involve discomfort or small sacrifices, and they shape how a character sees themselves. If a decision could sting, haunt, or change how someone acts for a while, but not forever, it’s medium. Look for hesitation and the feeling that the outcome will echo, even if just for a week.

If you select LOW:
Not quite. Low would mean Monica just buys the jacket or walks away with no emotional weight, and the day goes on unchanged. Here, she’s torn, which means the choice matters. If you sense the character could shrug it off instantly, it’s low. But any real dilemma pushes it up.

If you select HIGH:
No. High-potency would mean Monica’s whole life, identity, or relationships could change because of her decision—leaving home, quitting a job, telling a secret that can’t be untold. Here, the biggest risk is discomfort and a small regret, not an existential shift.

Vignette:
“Once more,” said Marner, “do you want to stay with me, or would you like to go with that lady?” ... “I want to stay with you, father,” said Eppie, with trembling lips... The decision was made, and its weight settled over the room.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
Exactly—this is high-potency. Eppie is being asked to choose between two lives: her true family, love, and poverty, or comfort and wealth with strangers. The decision will shape the rest of her story and can’t be taken back. When a choice alters someone’s identity, future, and relationships all at once, you’re in the high zone. High-potency decisions are rare and dramatic; they force a character to define who they are and what matters most, even if the cost is everything else. Look for scenes where a choice echoes forever—where nothing will ever be the same after.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium would mean there’s discomfort or risk, but Eppie could recover or find another path if she changed her mind. Here, there’s no way back. If the choice will haunt or reshape her for life, it’s high, not medium.

If you select LOW:
No. Low would be about a minor preference, not a life-altering crossroad. Eppie’s answer matters for everyone in the room, and it can’t be unmade. If the character’s future hangs in the balance, you’re not dealing with low.

42. Decision — Low Potency (Original, 100 words)
Vignette:
Avery stood at the crosswalk, sneakers tapping out an anxious beat. On one side: the same old route to work, predictable and dull. On the other: a side street she’d never walked, with ivy-tangled fences and unfamiliar faces. She hesitated, coffee cooling in her hand. Why not? It was just a different way to the same job. Still, her stomach fluttered as she stepped off the curb, turning left instead of right for once. The morning air felt different, and as she walked past sunlit porches and chattering sparrows, Avery wondered what else she might do differently, just for today.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
You got it—this is low-potency. Avery’s choice is about curiosity and a tiny bit of rebellion, but the risk is zero. Her destination, her safety, and her relationships are unchanged; only the scenery shifts. These little choices add color and texture to a character’s day but don’t move the plot or put anything important at risk. Look for moments where the outcome is just a new view or a small pleasure, and you’ll find low-potency decisions.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium would mean Avery had something to lose or gain—maybe she’s risking being late, or hopes to meet someone, or feels genuine fear. Here, it’s a mood, not a dilemma. The world is the same before and after.

If you select HIGH:
No. High is for decisions that change a life or close doors forever. If Avery’s turn would lead her to a different job, a loss, or a major discovery, maybe. But here, it’s just a different sidewalk.

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
Absolutely. This is a high-potency moment: the character is choosing between material comfort and true belonging, between the heart and survival. The choice is defining and can never be reversed. High-potency decisions force a character to sacrifice something irreplaceable for what they believe or love most. Look for language that shows a leap into the unknown or a cost that can never be regained—when a character leaves comfort for love, or stands by their values against all odds, it’s always high.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium would mean some risk or regret, but the core of the character remains untouched. Here, the character gives up everything for something bigger—there’s no going back. The story hinges on this choice.

If you select LOW:
No. Low-potency is for everyday picks, not the crossroads of the soul. This decision will be remembered for a lifetime, not just a day.

44. Change — Low Potency (Public Domain, 10 words)
Vignette:
“He began to whistle. It was his new habit.”
Cited: Mark Twain, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Chapter 2 (1876, public domain)

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
Correct—this is the very definition of a low-potency change. Tom’s shift is small and entirely personal. Picking up a habit like whistling might add flavor to his character, but it doesn’t alter his life or relationships in any lasting way. No one’s future is affected, and if Tom stopped whistling tomorrow, the story and his sense of self would remain intact. In fiction, low-potency change often looks like adopting a new phrase, a morning routine, or a tiny adjustment in attitude—something background, gentle, and quickly replaced if forgotten. These changes are real, but their impact is fleeting and usually unnoticed by others.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium-potency change is about a more noticeable shift in behavior or feeling—something that affects how a character interacts with the world or others. If Tom’s new habit had grown from a personal revelation, or if it altered his relationships or choices for days to come, you’d be looking at medium. Here, the act of whistling is just that: an act, not a transformation. The stakes are too low, the effect too light. In stories, medium change often leads to new decisions, conversations, or patterns. Tom’s shift is too minor to qualify.

If you select HIGH:
No, this isn’t high. High-potency change is radical: it’s about complete reinvention, dramatic loss, or a new self rising from the ashes of the old. If Tom had gone from trickster to hero, or sworn off his mischief forever, maybe—those are shifts you can’t take back. But a new habit, easily picked up and dropped, is barely a ripple. In fiction, high change transforms not just what a character does, but who they are at their core.

Vignette:
“Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her former assertions. Sufficient proof of her change of sentiment appeared on the very day of Mr. Knightley’s return... That evening, Emma walked alone in the garden, feeling the difference in her heart and the world around her. She found herself wishing for what she once denied. She smiled at the stars, knowing life was shifting quietly, and she was not afraid.”
Cited: Jane Austen, Emma, Volume III, Chapter XIII (1815, public domain, condensed)

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select MEDIUM (Correct):
That’s right—this is medium-potency change. Emma’s shift is real and substantial: her feelings for Mr. Knightley change how she sees herself and her world. It affects her behavior and her interactions; it’s not just a fleeting mood. Medium-potency change means a new way of thinking, acting, or feeling—enough to influence choices, relationships, or self-perception, but not enough to leave the old life behind entirely. These moments are turning points that stick, but don’t wipe out everything that came before. In stories, medium change is the foundation of arcs and growth: a character softens, forgives, stands up for themselves, or admits a truth they once denied. The effect is ongoing, visible, and significant.

If you select LOW:
Not quite. Low change is for passing moods or new habits—a detail that comes and goes, not a true transformation. Here, Emma’s change in sentiment is meaningful enough to shift the story’s direction and her relationships. She recognizes it, feels it, and acts on it, which makes it more than a passing fancy. If a change has a ripple effect that lasts or affects other characters, it’s rarely low. Medium changes stick and matter.

If you select HIGH:
No, this isn’t high-potency. High means total reinvention or an irreversible leap—Emma would have to become almost unrecognizable, rejecting her old world entirely. While her growth is essential, she’s still herself, just changed for the better. High change leaves no trace of the old self; here, we see a gentler, truer Emma, but she’s not reborn. In fiction, reserve high for moments when a character’s whole life, identity, or reality is made new.

Vignette:
“Gregory turned and walked away from the house for the last time, the keys cold in his hand. He looked back only once. Everything he’d known—family, fortune, even his name—was finished. In their place, a hard-won freedom, strange and raw, grew inside him as he disappeared into the city.”

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
Exactly—this is high-potency change. Gregory’s old life is over; he’s lost family, fortune, and even his sense of self. There’s no going back. High change in fiction always feels like a line crossed, a bridge burned, or a skin shed. A character is transformed at the root, forced to begin again. These moments usually close chapters and open new ones, marking the end of one self and the birth of another. If the story or character can never return to what was, you’re looking at high. Gregory’s moment is a total departure, an irreversible shift.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium change is important and lasting, but it doesn’t erase the past—more like a course correction than a new existence. Gregory isn’t just choosing a different job or moving houses; he’s leaving his identity behind. In fiction, medium changes add depth and show growth, but high-potency moments redefine what’s possible. If a change would leave a character still recognizable to their old friends, it’s not high. Gregory becomes someone new.

If you select LOW:
No, this isn’t low. Low change is for the small stuff—a new habit, a passing preference, or a minor mood. Gregory’s shift is existential: his entire world is gone, and what comes next is uncharted. If the old life and new life are strangers to each other, that’s high change.

Vignette:
“Mrs. March came quietly in, and stood beside her, saying nothing. Amy felt comforted, though she didn’t know why. Presently she put her hand in her mother’s, and said softly, ‘I’m glad you came. I was feeling cross and selfish, and I wanted to be alone; but I think I should like to stay with you now.’
Mrs. March drew her close, and, with a smile, said, ‘My dear, you are growing up.’
Amy nestled against her, feeling peaceful for the first time all day. Nothing remarkable had happened—no grand apologies or confessions—but something inside Amy shifted. She no longer wanted to shut everyone out or cling to her small grievances. She simply sat with her mother, the quiet room warming her heart.
Later, as Amy watched the sunset, she realized she hadn’t thought about herself for a whole hour. It felt new, and good. She smiled, thinking, ‘Perhaps I am changing, after all.’”
Cited: Louisa May Alcott, Little Women, Chapter 30 (1868, public domain, condensed)

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select LOW (Correct):
That’s correct—this is low-potency change. Amy’s shift is gentle and almost invisible: a mood softening, a little more willingness to share, a momentary reprieve from self-pity. These changes are subtle and real, but not transformative. Amy is comforted, feels a little older, and maybe a bit more open, but her personality and life aren’t altered at the core. In fiction, low change is about daily emotional weather—shifts that make the day better but don’t steer the future. If a character could slip right back into old patterns tomorrow, you’re looking at low.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium change lingers: it affects choices, relationships, or the course of events for days or weeks. If Amy’s realization led her to act differently with her sisters for the whole story, or sparked a new era in her life, that would be medium. Here, it’s a peaceful hour and a passing thought. Medium change feels significant, but doesn’t rewire everything; this is too gentle and fleeting.

If you select HIGH:
No, this isn’t high. High change is about rebirth—a character walks out different from who they were before, and their world will never see them the same way. Amy’s moment is sweet and a step forward, but it’s not the closing of one life and the opening of another. Save high for moments where everything is new, not just lighter.

“He is born again.”

Quiz:
What level is this element?

High

Medium

Low

If you select HIGH (Correct):
Yes—this is high-potency change in its purest, most concentrated form. To be “born again” is to be remade: everything before is left behind, and the character’s identity, worldview, and purpose are new. In fiction, this is the moment of resurrection, conversion, or radical transformation. A character who is born again is no longer the person they were; nothing from the old life can define them now. High change is rare and dramatic, usually signaling a climax or new era. If a single phrase can erase a life and launch a new one, that’s as high as it gets.

If you select MEDIUM:
Not quite. Medium change brings new patterns, priorities, or attitudes, but the core self remains. “Born again” means the old self is dead; medium would be learning a lesson, forgiving an enemy, or deciding to act differently. Medium can last a long time, but doesn’t fundamentally alter who the character is. Here, the change is so deep that nothing will ever be the same.

If you select LOW:
No, not at all. Low change is about a new mood, habit, or a small insight—a detail in the background, not the main event. “Born again” is transformation on the level of myth, religion, or destiny. It’s not a tweak; it’s a revolution. If a change wipes the slate clean and everything starts over, low isn’t even in the conversation.
