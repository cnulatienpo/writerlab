Decision — Game 1 — Low

Mickey stands in front of the vending machine, eyeing the two sodas left: grape or orange. He always picks grape, but today, for no reason at all, he punches the orange button. The can clatters down. He cracks it open, takes a sip, and shrugs. Not bad.








Desire — Low Potency 

Wendy wandered through the bookstore, dragging her fingers along the dusty spines. She wasn’t looking for anything in particular—maybe just something to pass the time before the bus. A display of cheap paperbacks caught her eye. A romance novel with a cartoonish cover, nothing like what she’d normally read. She picked it up, flipped a few pages, and grinned at a corny line. Did she want it? Not really. But as she carried it to the register, she thought, maybe she just wanted something new, even if it was silly—a small distraction, nothing more, nothing less.






Desire — Medium Potency 

Jonah scrolled through old photos on his phone—friends at the lake, arms around each other, faces sunburned and wild. He hesitated, thumb hovering over Casey’s number. They hadn’t talked since the fallout, but the urge to fix things kept buzzing in his chest. Maybe tonight, maybe now, he’d send a message and risk the silence that might follow. More than anything, he just wanted his friend back, even if it meant swallowing his pride.






Desire — High Potency

Allison stared at the glowing hospital monitor. She pressed her forehead to the glass, whispering his name. If sheer wanting could bring someone back, he’d be awake already. Her world had shrunk to this room, this hope, this impossible hunger for a miracle—she would give anything just to see him open his eyes.







Desire — Low Potency

From Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen:

“Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter. The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.

Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.

With delight she turned her eyes to the house, and scarcely dared lift them as they approached. Her mind was busily forming her own wishes as to the comfort and elegance of the house, but it was only a faint and idle curiosity—nothing more than the pleasure of seeing something new.”

Desire — High Potency (150 words) — Public Domain Example

From Great Expectations by Charles Dickens:

"I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me, than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection.

Estella, to the last hour of my life, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation I associate you only with the good, and I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!"

Stakes — Low Potency

Marcus stared at the microwave, waiting for his popcorn to finish. If he pulled the bag out too soon, it’d be half kernels; wait too long, it’d burn. He hovered by the beep, finger poised to stop it. Not life or death, but no one likes burnt popcorn for movie night.









Stakes — Medium Potency

Nina checked her email for the third time, heart thumping. The audition callback list was going out today. If her name wasn’t there, she’d spend another year in this cramped apartment, waiting tables and watching her friends land roles she only dreamed of. She paced, rehearsing lines just in case, but her confidence wavered—what if her performance wasn’t strong enough, what if she’d blown her only chance? The phone buzzed. Nina stared at the screen, weighing whether to check or keep hoping a little longer. If she made it, everything could change. If not, it was back to square one.






stakes, high

“I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man. I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not mad—as I am now. Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth? They have a worth—so I have always believed; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane—quite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by; there I plant my foot.”

Stakes-low

"We got out the boat and went for a bathe before breakfast, and then we set to work to get breakfast. We wanted to clean the kettle, but we could not find anything to clean it with. George suggested sand. We went and got some sand, but it was rather moist, and stuck to the kettle. Then George suggested that we should scrape it out with a stick. Harris said he thought it would be just as easy to clean it with a stone. So George went out and got a large flint, and began to hammer at the inside of the kettle with it, and at every blow he gave he knocked in a little bit of the kettle.

We had made up our minds to have some tea, so we washed out the kettle as best we could, filled it with water, and put it on to boil. But no tea had we. We all searched our pockets and bags for the tea. At last, Harris unearthed a paper parcel, and we sighed with relief. We had tea after all."

Stakes — Medium Potency 

Sylvia glanced at the clock—five minutes left in the exam. Sweat beaded on her forehead as she reread the final question, the one she couldn’t afford to miss. Passing meant keeping her scholarship and her spot on the team; failing would mean awkward calls home, maybe a part-time job, maybe not returning next semester. She erased another shaky answer, mind racing with half-remembered formulas. All around her, pencils scratched and chairs creaked. The pressure pressed in, heavier than she’d expected. When the teacher called time, Sylvia scribbled her best guess and handed in the test, hoping it was enough.






conflict-low

"Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged."

Conflict — Medium Potency 

The meeting room fell silent as Rosa slid her proposal across the table. Evan, arms crossed, shook his head. “We’ve already tried it your way,” he muttered. Their manager glanced between them, tension rising. Rosa clenched her jaw—this wasn’t just a disagreement; it was her chance to prove herself.






Conflict — High Potency

Lightning flashed as Lena pressed herself against the locked door, fists pounding. On the other side, her brother shouted for her to let him in, but she shook her head, tears streaming. Downstairs, footsteps thundered up the stairs—the intruder was close. Lena’s heart hammered as she fumbled with the key, desperate to save them both. Her brother’s voice broke, pleading, “Please, Lena!” The door wouldn’t budge. She had seconds to choose—risk it all, or lose everything.






Certainly. Here’s a 10-word, low-potency conflict line from the public domain (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll):

“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”

conflict-medium

Jo’s temper was decidedly tried this morning, for she was late and in a hurry. In her haste she caught up Amy’s lesson-book instead of her own, and was well on her way to school before she discovered the mistake. She turned back, and ran home for it. Meeting Amy in the hall, she asked for the book.

“You can’t have it,” said Amy, sulkily.

“Why not?”

“I want to use it myself.”

“But I’m late, and I can’t wait.”

“I’ll give it to you by and by.”

“No, you won’t,” returned Jo, angrily; and, snatching the book, she ran off without waiting to hear Amy’s loud lamentations and repeated demands for her property.

“You’ll be sorry for this, Jo March!” Amy called after her, as Jo hurried away. But Jo was not sorry, and did not see Amy’s face, as she turned away from the gate, and, returning home, set her small mind to work on the mischief to which she had been prompted by Jo’s disrespect.

2. Decision – Medium Potency 
Monica paused outside the thrift store, paycheck in hand. The jacket in the window—red leather, wild and gaudy—called to her. She bit her lip. Buy it, and ramen for a week. Walk away, and regret it forever. With a nervous laugh, she went inside, reaching for the hanger.

3. Decision – High Potency 
“Once more,” said Marner, “do you want to stay with me, or would you like to go with that lady?”

Eppie clasped his neck, and there was a silent pause. “Speak, my dear,” said Silas, as he gently turned her face towards the strangers.

“I want to stay with you, father,” said Eppie, with trembling lips.

“And you shall stay with me, my darling,” said Silas, folding her close.

The Squire’s wife gave a little, low sob. “God bless you, child! You have done what is right,” she whispered.

Eppie looked up, her face calm, but resolute. “I think nobody could be happier than we are, father. And I don’t want to be a lady—not if you’d rather I stayed.”

Marner held her even closer, heart full. The decision was made, and its weight settled over the room.

4. Decision – Low Potency
Avery stood at the crosswalk, sneakers tapping out an anxious beat. On one side: the same old route to work, predictable and dull. On the other: a side street she’d never walked, with ivy-tangled fences and unfamiliar faces. She hesitated, coffee cooling in her hand. Why not? It was just a different way to the same job. Still, her stomach fluttered as she stepped off the curb, turning left instead of right for once. The morning air felt different, and as she walked past sunlit porches and chattering sparrows, Avery wondered what else she might do differently, just for today.

“Is it better,” she said, “to be with those you love and starve, or to be well fed and alone?”

“I will go where my heart calls me,” she whispered, leaving the riches behind.

2. Change – Medium Potency 
“Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her former assertions. Sufficient proof of her change of sentiment appeared on the very day of Mr. Knightley’s return.

He had left her a friend, but he returned the lover of her dearest friend. Their first meeting was awkward, for Emma, though in lively spirits, felt the agitation of impending change, and her voice trembled as she welcomed him back. He soon perceived a gentler, warmer tone in her manner—a change he had never seen before.

Mr. Knightley, in his turn, showed a difference too: he spoke with more ease, more openness; his eyes sought hers, and the old barrier was gone.

That evening, Emma walked alone in the garden, feeling the difference in her heart and the world around her. She found herself wishing for what she once denied. She smiled at the stars, knowing life was shifting quietly, and she was not afraid.”

3. Change – High Potency 
“Gregory turned and walked away from the house for the last time, the keys cold in his hand. He looked back only once. Everything he’d known—family, fortune, even his name—was finished. In their place, a hard-won freedom, strange and raw, grew inside him as he disappeared into the city.”

4. Change – Low Potency 
“Mrs. March came quietly in, and stood beside her, saying nothing. Amy felt comforted, though she didn’t know why. Presently she put her hand in her mother’s, and said softly, ‘I’m glad you came. I was feeling cross and selfish, and I wanted to be alone; but I think I should like to stay with you now.’

Mrs. March drew her close, and, with a smile, said, ‘My dear, you are growing up.’

Amy nestled against her, feeling peaceful for the first time all day. Nothing remarkable had happened—no grand apologies or confessions—but something inside Amy shifted. She no longer wanted to shut everyone out or cling to her small grievances. She simply sat with her mother, the quiet room warming her heart.

Later, as Amy watched the sunset, she realized she hadn’t thought about herself for a whole hour. It felt new, and good. She smiled, thinking, ‘Perhaps I am changing, after all.’”
