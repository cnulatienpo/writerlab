## Quick Debugging Tips

Open the browser's DevTools console and log the main data objects to verify they
contain what you expect:

```js
console.log(currentAnalysisResult);
console.log(currentSceneBeats);
console.log(bookData);
```

If your charts or visual blocks aren't rendering, doubleâ€‘check the following:

- Canvas IDs match between your HTML and JavaScript.
- `draw...()` functions are called after data loads.
- Containers aren't hidden with `display: none`.
