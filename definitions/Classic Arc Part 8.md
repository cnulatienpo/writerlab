The Ordeal
This is the death.

That’s the job of this step: something dies. A belief, a relationship, a version of the self. Sometimes literally. Sometimes emotionally. But this part of the story kills something—and that absence echoes forward.

It’s not the climax. It’s not the final battle. It’s the place where the character loses something they didn’t know they were still holding. That loss changes them. They don’t just learn—they get cut by the learning.

The Ordeal isn’t a fight. It’s a crucible.

And if the story’s been doing its job, this is where the reader leans in.

What It Does in a Story
The Ordeal is the emotional center of the story.

Everything else has been building tension, stakes, character depth, conflict, and pressure. This step releases it—but not with relief. With cost.

The character faces something they cannot outsmart or outrun. Something they thought they were past, or not scared of anymore. And this time, there’s no dodging. It hits them where it hurts. It unmakes them.

It doesn’t have to be violent. But it has to be raw. It has to strip something away.

And in doing that, it makes room for something new to grow. But not yet. Right now, we’re still in the dark.

What It Feels Like
Realizing the person you trusted was lying

Losing someone you thought you’d never lose

Having to let go of your best defense

Getting what you wanted and finding it hollow

Knowing it was your fault—and no one else’s

Standing in the wreckage and realizing no one’s coming to save you

This is when the mask comes off. When pretending stops working. When everything sharpens because the story finally holds you accountable.

Tools You Can Use
1. Parallel Confrontation
Layer external conflict with internal stakes. It’s not just a fight—it’s what the fight means. That’s what hurts.

2. Reversal
Make the thing the character thought would save them be the thing that betrays them. The weapon breaks. The plan fails. The person bails.

3. Symbolic Undoing
Let a motif or repeated object break, get lost, or burn. Something that’s been with them—gone. The symbol dies alongside the old self.

4. Silence
You don’t need dialogue here. Let absence speak. Sometimes the most brutal ordeal is one the character can’t name.

5. Emotional Inversion
Let the character act against their established behavior. The calm one lashes out. The reckless one goes still. These fractures mark the damage.

Literary Devices That Work Here
✦ Irony
The hero finally gets what they asked for—at the exact moment they realize they didn’t want it.

✦ Symbolism
This is where metaphor becomes real. The storm hits. The mirror breaks. The bridge collapses. Let visuals mirror the internal fracture.

✦ Compression
This step should feel tight. Pressure builds. Sentences might get shorter. Space gets restricted. Even time might feel compressed—like the moment is closing in.

Extended Examples
In The Matrix, the Ordeal is Neo’s death. He dies. Flat out. Shot. No tricks. No cheat codes. It’s only after that moment—when Trinity admits love—that he resurrects. But death comes first. He loses his body. His grip. His control. That’s the price.

In The Hunger Games, the Ordeal is Rue’s death. Katniss doesn’t just lose an ally. She loses her sense of safety. Her idea that she could protect the innocent. The system shows its cruelty, and Katniss breaks open. That’s the real wound.

In Moonlight, the Ordeal is the cafeteria scene. It’s not a battle scene. It’s a slow, devastating disintegration of trust. Chiron is humiliated. Betrayed. Hurt. And what dies is his softness. The next time we see him, he’s hardened. That boy is gone.

In Arrival, the Ordeal is when Louise fully sees what the language reveals—time, loss, inevitability. She knows what will happen to her daughter. And chooses it anyway. What dies is the illusion of control. What’s born is grace.

In Get Out, the Ordeal is the sunken place. Not the hypnosis itself—the moment Chris realizes he has no bodily control. His agency dies. His sense of self is literally detached. The screen shows only his floating terror.

The Ordeal is the part of the story that doesn’t flinch.

Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Treating it like a boss battle
Don’t reduce this to mechanics. The Ordeal isn’t a “big fight scene.” It’s an emotional break. Use fights only if they’re layered with meaning.

❌ Rushing through it
This part needs space. The reader should feel it. Let the hurt land. Let the quiet sit. If you move on too fast, it feels fake.

❌ Making it too clean
This isn’t triumph. There is no neat solution here. If the character walks away unscathed, you didn’t go far enough.

Questions to Ask While Writing
What does the character lose here—and why did they need to lose it?

What does this moment take from them that they can’t get back?

What truth are they forced to confront?

What would a camera catch on their face in this moment?

What do they say—or fail to say?

Variants and Structural Notes
❖ “The False Victory”
The character wins—but it costs them. Maybe no one notices yet, but something essential is broken. The reader sees it, even if they don’t.

❖ “The Collapse”
Everything comes apart. The team falls apart. The safe house is exposed. The core belief shatters. This is often loud.

❖ “The Quiet Grief”
Nothing explodes. No one yells. But something is gone—and the stillness afterwards is unlivable. This is common in dramas, coming-of-age, tragedies.

❖ “The Mirror”
The character sees themselves clearly—and hates it. The confrontation is internal. The cut is self-inflicted.

What This Step Says to You
You’ve had an Ordeal.

You know the one. The thing you don’t talk about much. The moment you were changed by pain, silence, betrayal, or loss. You didn’t just learn something—you burned for it.

That’s what gives you the right to write this step. Not because you’re a writer. Because you’ve lived it.

You can describe the moment the floor went out. The breath didn’t come back. The apology never arrived. The door closed. The sound didn’t stop.

You don’t need to make it poetic. Just be honest.

This part of the story breaks your character.

That’s what makes the rebuild worth something.

The Ordeal has struck. The character’s been broken open, something vital has been lost, and the story’s heart is laid bare. They’ve faced the crucible—whether it was a fight, a betrayal, a truth they couldn’t dodge—and they’re not the same. The world hasn’t shifted yet, but the character has, and the reader feels the weight of that change. This phase, the aftermath of the Ordeal, is where the story lets the wound breathe. It’s where the character processes the loss, even if they don’t fully understand it, and where the narrative sets the stage for what comes next: the rebuild, the reward, the path forward.The Function of the Ordeal’s AftermathThe aftermath of the Ordeal serves to solidify the character’s transformation and deepen the story’s emotional resonance. The Ordeal was the breaking point; this phase is where the pieces settle, showing what’s gone and what’s left. It’s not about recovery yet—it’s about reckoning. The character must face the reality of their loss, whether it’s a belief, a relationship, or a part of themselves. This phase ensures the Ordeal’s impact lingers, making the character’s journey feel earned and the stakes feel real.This phase also bridges the story’s middle and end. It’s a moment of pause, but not relief. The character’s been changed, and the aftermath shows how that change affects their actions, their relationships, and their view of the world. It’s where the reader sees the cost of the Ordeal, not just in plot terms but in personal ones—what the character can’t go back to, what they’re carrying now. This sets up the next steps, where they’ll either rise or falter, but for now, it’s about sitting with the wound.Finally, the aftermath makes the story personal by tying the Ordeal to the character’s specific life. The loss isn’t abstract—it’s rooted in their fears, hopes, or history. This phase shows how the Ordeal hits them where it hurts, making the reader care not just about what happens next, but about who the character is becoming.Practical, Personal, and Specific Ways to Write the AftermathTo make the aftermath practical and personal, focus on small, specific moments that show the character grappling with their loss. These aren’t grand gestures—they’re quiet, human reactions that ground the Ordeal in their reality. Here’s how to do it:Show a Specific Physical Reaction to the Loss
The Ordeal’s impact should show up in the character’s body or actions, not just their thoughts. If your character is a teacher who just lost a student’s trust by reporting a scandal, don’t just say they’re shaken. Show them standing in their empty classroom, gripping a marker so tightly it snaps, or staring at a student’s empty desk, their coffee untouched on the podium. This physical detail—the broken marker, the cold coffee—makes the loss feel tangible and ties it to their role as a teacher.
Use a Specific Object to Anchor the Wound
Give the character something concrete that carries the Ordeal’s weight. If your character is a mechanic who just lost a mentor in a workplace accident, maybe they’re holding the mentor’s old wrench, noticing the worn grip where their hand used to fit. They don’t throw it away, but they don’t use it either—they just set it on their workbench, out of place. This object isn’t just a symbol; it’s a specific reminder of what’s gone, personal to their relationship.
Show a Specific Interaction That Reflects the Change
The Ordeal changes how the character relates to others, even if it’s subtle. If your character is a barista who stood up to a bully and got humiliated, maybe their coworker avoids their eyes the next shift, or a regular customer says, “You okay? You don’t seem like yourself.” Show the character forcing a smile, their voice quieter than usual, or brushing off the question but lingering on it later. This interaction shows the Ordeal’s ripple effect, making it personal to their world.
Highlight a Specific Shift in Routine
The Ordeal disrupts the character’s normal patterns, even if they try to go back. If your character is a single parent who just admitted a painful truth to their kid, show them trying to cook dinner like always, but burning the pasta because they’re staring at their kid’s closed bedroom door. The specific detail—the scorched pot, the sound of the door—shows how the Ordeal has cracked their routine, making the loss feel immediate and real.
Show a Specific Moment of Reflection
The character doesn’t need to understand the full impact yet, but they should feel it. If your character is a writer who just got rejected after pouring their heart into a manuscript, show them sitting at their desk, staring at the rejection email, then closing their laptop and picking up a pen instead. They don’t write—they just roll the pen between their fingers, the weight of failure sinking in. This small action, tied to their identity as a writer, shows they’re processing the loss without needing a monologue.

The Emotional and Narrative WeightThe aftermath is where the character feels the Ordeal’s cost most acutely. They’re not ready to move on—they’re stuck in the moment, grappling with what’s gone. The emotional weight comes from their vulnerability: they’ve been stripped of something, and they can’t pretend it didn’t happen. If your character is a student who just lost a friend’s trust by revealing a secret, show them walking home alone, noticing how the street feels emptier without their friend’s usual chatter. The reader should feel their isolation, their guilt, their quiet resolve to keep going.The narrative weight comes from the way this phase sets up the story’s next steps. The Ordeal has changed the character, and the aftermath shows how that change ripples through their world. It’s not just about the loss—it’s about what the loss makes possible. The reader should sense that the character’s old self is gone, and something new is starting to form, even if it’s messy or unclear.Examples in ActionIn Whiplash, the Ordeal is Andrew’s brutal performance under Fletcher’s abuse, where he pushes himself to the breaking point. The aftermath is him sitting in the practice room, hands bleeding, staring at his drumsticks. He doesn’t speak, but the specific detail—blood on the sticks—shows what he’s lost: his innocence, his limits. It’s personal to his drive to be great.In a grounded example, imagine a story about a nurse who just failed to save a patient. The Ordeal is the frantic code blue; the aftermath is her in the locker room, scrubbing her hands too long, the water too hot. She sees the patient’s chart on the counter, her name still written in her handwriting. This moment—specific to her role and her guilt—grounds the loss in her reality.In Avengers: Infinity War, Thor’s Ordeal is failing to stop Thanos. The aftermath is him sitting in the wreckage, holding Rocket’s gaze, his hammer useless. The specific detail—his silence, the weight of his failure—shows what’s died: his belief in his own strength.Mistakes to Avoid Making the Aftermath Too Hopeful
The character shouldn’t bounce back yet. Let them sit with the loss. A quick recovery cheapens the Ordeal’s impact. Show their pain or disorientation through a specific action or detail. Overloading with Action
The aftermath isn’t another test—it’s a pause. Don’t throw in a new fight or plot twist. Focus on the quiet, personal moments that show the Ordeal’s cost. Making It Too Vague
The loss needs to be specific. Tie it to something in the character’s life—a routine, a relationship, an object. Without specificity, the aftermath feels like a generic sad moment.Questions to Ask While WritingWhat’s one specific thing the character does that shows they’re reeling from the Ordeal?
What’s one object or detail that carries the weight of their loss?
Who notices the change in them, and how do they react?
What’s one routine that feels different now, and why?
What’s one truth they’re starting to face, even if they can’t name it?What This Means for YouYou’ve lived an Ordeal. The moment you lost something—a friendship, a belief, a version of yourself. The moment you stood in the wreckage, knowing you couldn’t go back. Maybe it was the night you didn’t sleep, staring at a text you couldn’t answer. Maybe it was the day you packed a box and realized it was really over. You know the weight of that loss, the way it changed how you moved through the world.That’s what your character’s feeling now. The way they hold a coffee mug too tightly, or avoid a certain street. The way they look at someone and see a stranger. Write those moments. Write the silence after the break. Write the thing they can’t say but feel in their bones.This is where the story hurts.
