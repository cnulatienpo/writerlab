 Indulgence vs. Excess
So you’ve leaned into your obsessions.
You’ve let your shame onto the page.
You’re finally writing the stuff that feels hot in your hands.

But now a different fear shows up.

“Am I doing too much?”
“Is this self-indulgent?”
“Is this… cringe?”

Let’s be real. Some writers absolutely drown in their own indulgence.
They fall in love with their own voice and never shut up.
They write three pages about someone lighting a cigarette.
They build scenes that go nowhere, but god damn do they love the dialogue.
They keep circling the same idea, hoping it feels profound if they just say it louder.

That’s not honesty. That’s bloat.

So how do you tell the difference?

Where’s the line between indulgence (truth, flavor, risk) and excess (static, self-satisfaction, noise)?

Here’s how to tell.

🚧 Rule 1: Indulgence Moves the Story. Excess Stalls It.
Indulgence pushes something forward.
Even if it’s weird. Even if it’s raw. Even if it’s off-genre.

Ask:

Did this indulgent moment reveal something new about the character?

Did it shift a relationship?

Did it change the emotional temperature of the scene?

Did it deepen the world or reframe the stakes?

If yes: that’s indulgence doing its job. It may be messy, but it’s alive.

Excess, on the other hand, is static.
It lingers too long. It repeats the same idea three different ways. It adds decoration without substance.
It’s a monologue that starts powerful and turns into a TED Talk nobody asked for.
It’s a flashback that tells you what you already knew, just more dramatically.

Indulgence burns fuel. Excess idles.

If you find yourself rereading a section and feeling like it’s pretty, but the story’s just kind of… sitting there?

That’s excess. Time to cut or condense.

💥 Rule 2: Indulgence Creates Risk. Excess Avoids It.
Good indulgence risks something:

Emotional vulnerability

Pacing whiplash

Tonal dissonance

Offending the reader

Being misunderstood

Excess, ironically, often feels safer.
It’s performative. It tries to impress. It adds detail or cleverness because the writer is avoiding risk.

You’ll know it when you feel it:

You’re padding a scene because you don’t want to move forward.

You’re writing voice-y paragraphs because you don’t trust the character’s action to speak.

You’re dropping pop culture references not because they mean something, but because they’re familiar.

Indulgence feels like you’re about to say something real and maybe get judged for it.
Excess feels like you’re performing to avoid silence.

One is risky. One is noise.

Choose the risk.

🎯 Rule 3: Indulgence Has a Target. Excess Just Wanders.
There’s a difference between a scene that indulges a tension and one that just sinks into itself.

Imagine:

A character goes on a long tangent about the movies she watched as a kid.
If it reveals her values, her blind spots, her longing? That’s indulgence.
If it’s just nostalgia porn because the writer likes that era? That’s excess.

A sex scene that’s graphic and unflinching.
If it escalates intimacy, exposes power dynamics, or raises emotional stakes? That’s indulgence.
If it’s just titillation that could be lifted out without changing the plot? That’s excess.

The key difference is intention.

Indulgent scenes always want something. They’re working toward pressure, clarity, conflict, or catharsis.
Excessive scenes just hang out and vibe.

You don’t have to be efficient—but you do have to be aiming at something.

✂ Rule 4: If It Feels Like a Hallway, Trim It.
Here’s a structural trick.

When you look at your scene, does it feel like:

A room? (Something is happening.)

A mirror? (Something is being reflected or revealed.)

A hallway? (Nothing’s happening—just walking between places.)

Rooms and mirrors can be indulgent and powerful.
Hallways are usually excess.

If you’ve written a scene that’s just one character walking around, thinking vague thoughts, waiting for the next real thing to happen? That’s a hallway.

Cut it. Or turn it into something.
Make it weird. Make it tense. Make it indulgent on purpose.

Just don’t leave it inert.

🧪 Rule 5: The Litmus Test—Can You Justify It to Yourself?
Forget audience. Forget editors.

Ask yourself:

Why is this here?

What am I getting out of it?

What is the story getting out of it?

If I had to defend this scene in a courtroom, could I do it without flinching?

If you can answer those questions, even if the scene’s messy? Keep it.
If your only answer is “I like it”? Be honest: is that enough?

Sometimes yes.
Sometimes “I like it” is all it takes. Especially early on.

But if it’s clogging the arteries of your story? You know what you have to do.

Save it somewhere. Use it later. You’re not throwing it away.
You’re putting it where it belongs.

🚀 When to Go Harder
Here’s the twist: Sometimes your “excess” is only excessive because you didn’t go far enough.

Half-measure indulgence is awkward.
A rant that almost says what you mean? Cringe.
A sexy scene that’s almost sexy? Boring.
A strange idea that’s half-weird? Forgettable.

If a scene feels “off,” don’t assume it needs to be cut.

Ask:

Is this flopping because I pulled back?

What would happen if I pushed it further?

What am I scared to include?

Sometimes excess is just timidity in disguise.

And the real fix is to go harder.

Let the rant go longer.
Let the moment get messier.
Let the indulgence become a wave, not a drizzle.

Not every scene needs to be wild. But if you're gonna indulge—commit.

Readers can feel it when you flinch.

Final Thought: Edit Like a Surgeon, Not a Censor
The goal is not to make your story clean.
It’s to make your story honest.

Indulgence is the blood.
Excess is the clot.

You don’t need to purge the personal. You just need to shape it.

Don’t ask, “Is this too much?”
Ask, “Is this doing something?”

If the answer is yes, even if it’s weird, ugly, or indulgent as hell—keep it.

Let your world be too loud before you worry about turning the volume down.
