How to Spot Desire in the Wild
1. They SAY What They Want
Sometimes, desire is right on the surface. A character names what they want, plain and clear. This is the easiest to spot because it’s spoken out loud or written down—there’s no hiding, no code, no guessing. They claim it, own it, or maybe blurt it out in a moment of weakness. You don’t have to dig; they hand it to you.

What Does It Look Like?
It could be a grand declaration (“I want to be king!”), a desperate confession (“I just want someone to love me”), or even a flippant aside (“Honestly, I just want a fucking nap”). Sometimes it’s a line in a speech, sometimes it’s a throwaway comment at the bar. Whatever the moment, when someone says what they want, everything that follows is shaped by that admission. The story is about to bend around this hunger, for better or worse.

Why Writers Use It
Making a character say what they want clarifies the stakes for the reader or audience. There’s no ambiguity: you know what to look for, what to worry about, what to hope for or dread. When a character names their desire, you can feel the risk—if they don’t get it, something breaks. You can also feel the world start to push back. People who declare their desires tend to find out just how tough the world (and the plot) can be.

What to Listen For
Direct statements: “I need to find my brother.” / “I’m going to win this competition.”

Vows and promises: “I swear I’ll never let anyone hurt you again.”

Revealed dreams: “Someday I’m gonna make it out of this town.”

Moments of anger or frustration: “All I want is for someone to listen to me for once!”

Moments of vulnerability: “I just want to be happy.”

Why It Matters
When desire is spoken, it’s like a flag planted in the story. The audience can track every action, every obstacle, every betrayal back to this one, clear line in the sand. Even if the character tries to backpedal, you know what’s really at stake. Every victory or loss circles back to what was said, and there’s a special kind of heartbreak or satisfaction when a character gets (or doesn’t get) the thing they asked for.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

The Princess Bride — Inigo Montoya: “Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.”
Says it, means it, lives it. Every action flows from this stated desire for revenge.

Hamilton — Alexander Hamilton: “I am not throwing away my shot!”
He’s hungry, he admits it, and every song and setback is about chasing opportunity.

Finding Nemo — Marlin: “I promised I’d never let anything happen to him!”
Says what he wants—safety for his son. The whole movie is a struggle with this desire.

Legally Blonde — Elle Woods: “I’ll show you how valuable Elle Woods can be!”
Declares her desire to prove herself. Everything unfolds from this moment.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone — Harry: “I just… I just want to know what my parents looked like.”
A softer, vulnerable desire that drives the emotional core of his journey.

The Pursuit of Happyness — Chris Gardner: “I’m the type of person that if you ask me a question and I don’t know the answer, I’m going to tell you that I don’t know. But I bet you what: I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer.”
Lays out his hunger and determination for a better life.

Mad Max: Fury Road — Furiosa: “I’m looking for hope.”
A spoken desire that steers every wild turn of the story.

Ratatouille — Remy: “I want to be a great chef.”
States it early and the whole plot is about the impossible climb to get there.

How It Changes the Story
When desire is out in the open, it gives the audience a lens—a way to measure every action and every setback. You don’t need subtext or hidden meaning; you’re watching someone chase a named need. Even if the story twists and the desire shifts, you’ve got a baseline for what drives them.
It’s also risky: characters who say what they want make themselves vulnerable. They can be mocked, challenged, or blocked. Sometimes they get it, sometimes not. But once it’s said, there’s no going back.

For Writers
Don’t be afraid to let your characters say what they want. It doesn’t make them flat—it makes them real, and it gives your story spine. Sometimes the boldest thing a character can do is admit what’s inside them.
2. They SHOW What They Want
Desire isn’t always spoken. Most of the time, it leaks out in action—what a character does when nobody’s watching, or what they can’t help but do even when it’s risky. Sometimes they never say a word about what’s burning inside, but their choices scream it loud.

What Does It Look Like?
You see it in their decisions—the things they chase, the rules they break, the lines they won’t cross, the trouble they invite. It’s the quiet stuff: a look, a pause, the way they always end up standing outside the same window. It’s habits, obsessions, slips, and patterns. Sometimes a character says the opposite of what they want, but their actions always give them away. Desire hides in what a character can’t stop doing, even when it makes no sense.

Why Writers Use It
“Show, don’t tell” is one of the oldest rules because action is honest. People (and characters) often lie with their words but can’t fake what they want with their choices. Showing desire makes the audience work a little—pulling them closer, letting them feel clever for noticing the undercurrent. It creates depth, subtext, and tension, because sometimes even the character doesn’t know what they want until their own actions reveal it.

What to Watch For
Repeated behaviors: Always going back to the same person, place, or habit.

Sacrifice: Giving up something valuable to get closer to what they want.

Risk: Taking chances, breaking rules, or inviting trouble for the sake of their desire.

Persistence: Refusing to give up, even after setbacks or rejection.

Contradiction: Saying one thing, but doing another. (E.g., “I don’t care”—but they keep coming back.)

Why It Matters
Showing desire in action makes it feel true—because real life is like this. Most people don’t announce their longings; they act on them, sometimes in ways they can’t explain. When you write (or spot) desire in action, you turn a character into a living, breathing person. Readers connect on a gut level, even if the words never come.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

Indiana Jones (Raiders of the Lost Ark)
He doesn’t talk much about why he risks his life for relics, but he’s always running, fighting, risking everything to keep history alive. His desire is in the action—never quitting, always diving back in.

Joe March (Little Women)
She insists she doesn’t care about marriage, but keeps pouring herself into her writing, fighting for her independence, and showing her longing for recognition and family.

Don Draper (Mad Men)
He rarely talks about what he wants, but his affairs, constant reinvention, and creative risk-taking show his hunger for meaning, connection, and escape from himself.

Joel (The Last of Us)
He doesn’t say “I need family again,” but everything he does to protect Ellie, the sacrifices, the violence, the soft moments—his desire is written in blood and sweat.

Shrek (Shrek)
He claims he wants to be left alone, but everything he does—going on the quest, saving Fiona, letting Donkey in—shows a craving for friendship and acceptance.

Moana (Moana)
She’s told to stay on the island, but she keeps going to the water, practicing, rebelling, risking everything for something she can’t fully name.

Tony Soprano (The Sopranos)
He says he’s fine, but the therapy visits, his violence, his obsession with family—all show the mess of desire inside him.

Batman/Bruce Wayne (DC Comics, films)
He never admits he’s seeking peace or justice—he just keeps putting on the mask and risking his life to save Gotham, night after night.

WALL-E (WALL-E)
No words for most of the film—he just keeps saving little trinkets, watching old musicals, caring for his plant, following EVE across space. Everything he does points to longing for connection and purpose.

Eleven (Stranger Things)
She rarely says what she wants, but always runs toward her friends, faces down monsters, and risks everything for belonging and love.

How It Changes the Story
When desire is shown, not told, the story gains layers. The audience gets to “read” the character’s actions and fill in the gaps. It creates tension—sometimes the character is at war with themselves, sometimes the audience knows before they do. Watching someone act out their need is often more satisfying than just hearing about it. You get the stakes, the risk, the hunger, with no hand-holding.

For Writers
Let your characters betray themselves with action. Make them break their own rules, go out of their way, give up things, ruin things, cross lines, return to the same hurt over and over. Don’t just have them say “I want”—show what they’ll actually do for it. If you do this, even the most reluctant, silent, or complex character will come alive.
