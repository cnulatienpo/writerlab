 SEQUENCES BUILD ACTS
(The Secret Architecture of Momentum)

Acts aren't just divisions—they're emotional ecosystems. Each act is a collection of sequences that transforms your character's world in irreversible ways.

Think of acts like gravity wells:

Act 1: The slide into chaos

Act 2: The struggle in freefall

Act 3: The clawing toward light

Let’s break how sequences power these seismic shifts.

I. WHY ACTS NEED SEQUENCES (NOT JUST SCENES)
Bad Structure:

Act 1: 12 random scenes about a guy’s life

Act 2: 30 scenes of stuff happening

Act 3: A sudden climax

Great Structure:

Act 1 = 3 Sequences:

"Broken Normal" (Establish flaw)

"The Offer" (Inciting incident + refusal)

"No Return" (Forced into the journey)

Example: The Matrix

Neo’s dead-end life

"Follow the white rabbit"

"Red pill or blue pill?"

II. THE 5 SEQUENCES EVERY ACT NEEDS
Act 1: The Descent
Ghost Sequence (Show the wound)

Example: Up’s "Married Life" montage

Inciting Sequence (The door opens)

Example: Harry Potter’s letters from Hogwarts

Commitment Sequence (Burn the boats)

Example: Thelma & Louise shooting the rapist

Act 2: The Storm
Fun & Games Sequence (Promise of the premise)

Example: Jurassic Park’s first dinosaur tour

Midpoint Sequence (False victory/crushing defeat)

Example: The Empire Strikes Back’s "I am your father"

Act 3: The Ascent
Dark Night Sequence (All is lost)

Example: Shawshank’s prison rape revelation

Climax Sequence (Final test of new self)

Example: Mad Max’s "Witness me" war rig battle

Denouement Sequence (New normal)

Example: Toy Story’s "You’ve got a friend in me" reprise

III. ACT STRUCTURE BY GENRE
Thriller:
Act 1: "Innocent drawn into conspiracy" sequences

Act 2: "False ally → betrayal" sequences

Act 3: "Improvised weapon vs. mastermind" sequences

Romance:
Act 1: "Chemistry vs. baggage" sequences

Act 2: "Forced proximity → intimacy" sequences

Act 3: "Grand gesture or tragic parting" sequences

Horror:
Act 1: "Rules established" sequences

Act 2: "Rules broken → consequences" sequences

Act 3: "Survivor becomes predator" sequences

Exercise: Map your WIP’s sequences into acts. Do they escalate?

IV. FIXING ACT PROBLEMS
❌ Act 1 Drags
Fix: Start with a prologue sequence that shows the opposite of the ending (The Social Network’s breakup).

❌ Act 2 Sags
Fix: Add a "B story" sequence that mirrors the theme (In Alien, the cat subplot echoes isolation).

❌ Act 3 Rushes
Fix: Insert a "quiet before storm" sequence (The Batman’s floodlight moment).

V. THE GOLDEN RULE OF ACT TRANSITIONS
The last sequence of an act must:

Answer the act’s central question

Raise a more urgent question

Change the stakes permanently

Example: The Prestige

Act 1 ends with Angier’s wife drowning (personal → obsessive)

Act 2 ends with the cloned Angier (moral → horrific)
