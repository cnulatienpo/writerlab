Post 1.5: Crafting Character Arcs – The Positive Arc (How to Write Transformational Growth)
(A bonus installment in the Crafting Character Arcs series – Read the full series here)

Positive arcs aren’t about “good” characters—they’re about broken ones.

The kind who start out clinging to a lie, who resist change until the story forces them to choose: evolve or collapse.

Think:

Frodo (Lord of the Rings) – "I wish none of this had happened." → "I choose to carry the Ring."

Eleanor (The Good Place) – "I’m a trash person." → "I can be better."

Shrek (Shrek) – "Better alone than rejected." → "Love is worth the risk."

But here’s what most guides miss: A positive arc isn’t a straight line upward. It’s a spiral—a cycle of resistance, relapse, and hard-won progress.

Let’s break it down.

1. The 5 Beats of a Compelling Positive Arc
Beat 1: The Lie They Believe
A false worldview rooted in fear ("Vulnerability is weakness," "I’m unworthy of love").

Example: Woody (Toy Story) believes his worth depends on being Andy’s favorite.

Beat 2: The Wound That Fuels It
A past trauma that justifies the lie.

Example: Moana’s father forbids sailing after his friend died at sea.

Beat 3: The Reluctant Journey
They pursue an external goal (often selfish) while avoiding internal growth.

Example: Han Solo joins the Rebellion for money, not ideals.

Beat 4: The Mirror Moment
They see their lie clearly—and almost turn back.

Example: In Paddington 2, Paddington considers stealing the book to clear his name.

Beat 5: The Earned Change
They act differently—proving their growth.

Example: In Ratatouille, Ego abandons his cynicism after tasting the dish.

2. Why Positive Arcs Feel Earned (Not Preachy)
The magic isn’t in the ending—it’s in the resistance.

A. Let Them Fail First
A character who changes too easily feels cheap.

Example: Zuko (ATLA) betrays Iroh after seeming to reform.

B. Make the Lie Seductive
Their old mindset shouldn’t feel stupid—it should feel safe.

Example: In Crazy Rich Asians, Rachel could’ve walked away from Nick’s family. That’s why her choice to stay matters.

C. The Price of Growth
They must lose something to gain their new truth.

Example: In Frozen, Elsa’s freedom requires abandoning the palace.

3. Writing a Positive Arc That Doesn’t Feel Cheesy
A. Avoid “Suddenly Good” Syndrome
Growth isn’t a light switch—it’s a series of micro-choices.

Tool: Map 3 small moments where they almost relapse.

B. Tie Growth to Action
Don’t just tell us they changed—show them doing the thing they’d never do earlier.

Example: In The Shawshank Redemption, Andy’s final act of hope is mailing the evidence.

C. Let Secondary Characters Call BS
Have someone name their lie before they’re ready to hear it.

Example: In Tangled, Flynn calls out Rapunzel’s fear of leaving the tower.

4. Your Turn: The Growth Draft
Exercise 1: The Lie They Tell Themselves
Write your character’s internal monologue at the start vs. the end. How does their self-talk shift?

Exercise 2: The Relapse Scene
Write a moment where they almost revert to old habits—and what stops them.

Closing Thought: Positive Arcs Are the Stories We Need
We don’t write them because they’re easy.

We write them because they’re true—to the stubborn, glorious mess of human change.
