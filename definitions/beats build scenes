PART 2: SCENES BUILD SEQUENCES
(The Hidden Architecture of Momentum)

You don't remember individual scenes. You remember how they collide.

A sequence is 3-5 scenes that form a self-contained mini-story, with its own:

Beginning (status quo)

Middle (escalation)

End (game-changer)

Master this, and your story becomes unputdownable.

I. WHY SEQUENCES > SCENES
Most writers think in:
❌ Isolated scenes (good moments that don't accumulate)
✅ Sequences (interdependent units that create flow)

Example: The Heist Sequence in Ocean's 11

Scene 1: The team argues the plan (conflict)

Scene 2: They case the casino (preparation)

Scene 3: The vault breach goes wrong (twist)

Alone? Interesting. Together? Electric.

II. THE 3 LAWS OF POWERFUL SEQUENCES
1. The Cause/Effect Chain
Every scene must create the problem the next one solves.

Bad:

Scene A: Car chase

Scene B: Coffee date (wtf?)

Good:

Scene A: Hero escapes killers → gets wounded

Scene B: Takes shelter with ex-lover → stitches wound while arguing

2. The Emotional Escalator
Sequences should turn up the heat emotionally:

First scene: Frustration

Middle scene: Anger

Final scene: Rage

(Example: Walter White's descent in Breaking Bad's "Face Off" sequence)

3. The Midpoint Pivot
The sequence's 3rd scene should flip expectations:

New info ("The killer is your father")

Reversed power ("The prisoner takes control")

Moral dilemma ("Save one or save many?")

III. 5 TYPES OF KILLER SEQUENCES
1. The Time Bomb
(Deadline-driven tension)
Example: Mission Impossible's "Langley break-in"

2. The Snowball
(Small problem → huge consequences)
Example: Fargo's "kidnapping gone wrong"

3. The Swarm
(Multiple POVs converging)
Example: Game of Thrones' "Battle of the Bastards" setup

4. The Mirage
(Fake resolution → bigger threat)
Example: Get Out's "escape that isn't"

5. The Detonator
(Seemingly unrelated scenes → explosive connection)
Example: The Departed's "rat reveal"

Exercise: Take a flat section of your WIP. Rewrite it as one of these sequence types.

IV. SEQUENCE FAILURES (AND HOW TO FIX THEM)
❌ The Sagging Middle
(Scenes feel episodic, not connected)
Fix: Add a ticking clock (e.g., "The bomb activates in 3 scenes")

❌ The Whiplash
(Tone shifts too abruptly)
Fix: Insert a bridge scene (e.g., After a murder, show the killer washing blood off hands)

❌ The Empty Calories
(Fun but pointless action)
Fix: Tie each scene to the character's flaw (e.g., Jason Bourne fights while resisting his past)

V. FROM SEQUENCE TO ACT
A great Act 2 = 3-4 sequences that:

Raise the stakes ("Now they're after my family")

Deepen the flaw ("I'm becoming what I hate")

Force a choice ("Burn the evidence or turn myself in?")

Case Study: The Godfather's "Michael in Sicily" sequence:

Scenes: Wedding → assassination → exile → love story

Arc: From reluctant outsider to ruthless heir
