Narration Part 2: Choosing a Narrator Is a Tactical Move
Here’s what nobody tells you when you’re learning to write:
Point of view is not a vibe. It’s a weapon loadout.

You don’t choose a narrator because it “feels natural.” You choose it because you want to do something to the reader. You want to control what they know, what they feel, and when they start to squirm. The narrator is how you do it.

If you're someone who's actually tried to write stories—real stories, not just ideas in a notebook—you've already made these decisions. You’ve slipped between perspectives. You’ve felt the tug of wanting to zoom in on a moment or back out to keep some dignity. You’ve changed how a sentence lands by deciding whether the narrator tells the truth or just lets the reader guess.

You already know what it’s like to narrate something. This is about making it conscious.

Don’t Choose the Viewpoint. Choose the Outcome.
Writers get told to “pick a POV” like they’re choosing a camera angle. First person for intimacy. Third person for distance. Second person if you want to be weird. That’s surface-level thinking.

What matters isn’t the angle. It’s the effect.

So start here: What do you want the reader to experience?
Then build backwards.

Examples:

Want the reader to feel trapped in one character’s mind? → First person or extremely close third.

Want the reader to know more than the characters and feel dread build up? → Limited third with selective cutaways or controlled omniscience.

Want to withhold critical information from the reader without making it feel like a cheat? → Pick a narrator who doesn’t know it or refuses to admit it.

Want the reader to feel complicit in something? → Second person or a first person who makes you agree with them before they turn the knife.

This is where tactical thinking starts. Every narrator type gives you access to different tools. If you want to use flashback, bias, dramatic irony, misdirection, or momentum control—you better pick a narrator who can do that work.

First Person: Confession, Delusion, or Weapon
When you write in first person, you’re not just writing “from their point of view.” You’re writing as if they’re telling the story. That’s a big commitment.

Ask yourself:
Who is this character telling the story to? Why now? Why this way?

Sometimes the answer is “no one.” Fine. But that doesn’t make it neutral.

There are three main modes you’re probably already familiar with—even if you didn’t call them by name.

1. The Confessional
They’re telling the story to get it off their chest. Think memoir tone. Think aftermath.
You can control:

Regret

Justification

Self-awareness

Silence (what they won’t talk about)

When I was narrating something close to the bone, this is the mode I slipped into without meaning to. I thought I was “just telling what happened.” But I was really building a little shrine of half-truths and earned moments. It wasn’t fact. It was my version.

2. The Delusional
They believe everything they say. We don’t.
Perfect for:

Dramatic irony

Twists that don’t feel cheap

Character studies

Slow horror

When you write this way, you’re trusting the reader to stay one step ahead—or catch on just in time. You’re narrating in a code you’ve planted with booby traps. I've written from here too. It's a high wire act. You can’t go meta or wink. You have to let the delusion breathe.

3. The Weaponized Voice
They want the reader on their side. They know what they’re doing.
Used best for:

Manipulation

Sympathy for the devil

Genre-bending (memoir disguised as manifesto)

This is where your narrator becomes a politician. They cherry-pick. They frame. They charm. They seduce. And you, the writer, get to make them burn for it later. If you’ve ever told a story to make someone like you—and then regretted it—you already know how to write this.

Third Person: The Trick Is in the Distance
Third person is the default for most writers. It’s flexible, familiar, and avoids the awkward “I” problem. But again—it’s not just a choice of grammar. It’s a range of tactical settings that completely change the reader’s experience.

Let’s talk about psychic distance. Not in the mystical sense. In the “how close are we to the character’s mind” sense.

Imagine this moment:
A woman spills coffee on her lap.

Depending on your narrative distance, you might write:

The woman was wearing a navy skirt.

She spilled the coffee. It soaked straight through.

Goddammit. She grabbed a napkin but it was already too late.

Of course this would happen today. The one morning she left early.

She always ruined things. Even something as simple as coffee.

Each of those is third person. But each has a totally different emotional zoom level.

So when you’re writing third, ask:

Am I outside their body or inside their bloodstream?

Am I telling what happened or how it felt?

Do I want the reader to know what’s coming—or feel as surprised as the character?

You’re not just reporting. You’re tuning the signal.

When I’m editing my own stuff, this is the slider I fiddle with most. Sometimes I realize I wrote a moment too far inside—I gave away too much, made it too intimate, and the character lost some dignity. Other times I realize I stayed too safe, and the moment feels cold when it should wreck.

Omniscient: You Are the God. Be a Good One.
Omniscient isn’t just “knowing everything.” It’s telling the story from a position that knows more than the characters ever could.

It’s also hard as hell to do well. Why? Because you have to control what you reveal and still make it feel earned. You can’t just drop in exposition bombs and call it voice.

Good omniscient narration has attitude. It has commentary. It has opinion. It’s not bland or encyclopedic. It knows things, and it wants you to think about them.

If you’ve ever narrated something and slipped into a rhythm where you started commenting—not just describing—you’ve been in this mode. When you’re telling a story to a friend and you go, “Okay, this is where it gets messed up,” you’re doing omniscient storytelling. You’re pulling back to give the reader context before they feel the hit.

That’s a move. You can use it. But only if you mean to.

Second Person: Don’t Get Cute Unless You Mean It
Second person is usually used one of two ways:

Intimacy

You’re trying to draw the reader into a personal experience.

Usually trauma, addiction, shame, obsession.

Feels like memory. Or command.

Disorientation

You’re playing with identity.

The “you” might not be the reader. It might be the character’s own voice split off from them.

Or it might be you, the writer, using the narrator to punch the reader in the face.

Second person is powerful. But only if you’re doing something that actually needs it.

If you don’t know why you’re using it, don’t. If you do, double down. Make it bite.

Don’t Default. Design.
Every time you write a sentence, you're making a tactical decision—whether you admit it or not. Who’s telling the story? What do they know? What do they care about?

You’ve probably told stories about your own life where you shifted the narration without realizing it. One version to make your friends laugh. Another to make your therapist understand. Another to make someone fall in love with you. Each one used different framing, different emphasis, different omissions. Each one was true, but not the same.

That’s what a narrator is.

It’s not an accident. It’s not “just how you wrote it.”

It’s a strategy. It’s a pose. It’s a damn costume with a hidden blade.

So stop pretending you’re just picking a voice. You’re picking a weapon. Use it like one.

Think of it like cooking: the narrator is your seasoning. The same ingredients (your characters, setting, plot) can taste wildly different depending on how you season them. A sarcastic narrator makes a tragic scene feel darkly funny. A compassionate narrator makes the same scene heartbreaking. As a beginner, you need to understand that every narrator choice shapes the reader’s experience—and you’re in control of that.Why It Matters: A poorly chosen narrator can make your story feel generic or confusing. A well-chosen narrator makes it unforgettable, even if the plot is simple. For example, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins uses a first-person narrator (Katniss) to create urgency and intimacy, pulling readers into her survival mindset. If it had been written in a distant third-person, the stakes wouldn’t hit as hard.Actionable Tip: Before you start writing, write down one sentence describing what you want your reader to feel at the end of your story (e.g., “I want readers to feel the weight of betrayal”). Then, as you choose your narrator, ask, “Does this narrator help me achieve that feeling?”HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT NARRATORChoosing a narrator isn’t about what feels “natural.” It’s about what serves your story’s goal. Here’s a step-by-step process to help beginners make a tactical choice.Step 1: Define Your Story’s Emotional Goal
What do you want your reader to walk away feeling? Suspense? Empathy? Shock? This is your North Star. Every narrator choice should align with this goal.  Example: If you’re writing a mystery and want readers to feel paranoid, a first-person narrator who’s unreliable (like in My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite) keeps readers guessing. If you want them to feel detached awe, an omniscient narrator with a grand, poetic tone (like in One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez) might work better.Why: The narrator is your primary tool for controlling emotion. Beginners often focus on plot first, but emotion is what makes readers care.  Step 2: Decide What the Reader Should Know
Your narrator controls information flow. Do you want readers to know everything, just one character’s perspective, or something in between?  First-Person: Readers only know what the narrator knows (or chooses to share). Great for intimacy or deception.  
Third-Person Limited: Readers know one character’s thoughts but not others’. Good for suspense or focus.  
Third-Person Omniscient: Readers know more than any single character. Ideal for epic scope or irony.  
Second-Person: Readers are immersed as “you,” creating intimacy or disorientation.

Example: In Dune by Frank Herbert, the omniscient narrator dips into multiple characters’ minds, revealing political schemes that no single character fully understands. This builds a sense of epic stakes. A first-person narrator would’ve made it feel too personal and small.Why: Information control creates tension, surprise, or dread. Beginners should practice deciding what to reveal and when to hold back.  Step 3: Choose the Narrator’s Personality
Your narrator needs a distinct voice, even in third-person. Are they witty? Melancholic? Judgmental? This voice shapes how readers interpret the story.  Exercise: Write a simple scene (e.g., a character walking through a park) in three different narrative voices:  Snarky: “She trudged through the park, dodging dog poop and tourists who thought they owned the place.”  
Poetic: “Her steps whispered through the park, where leaves fell like secrets in the autumn light.”  
Blunt: “She walked through the park. It was crowded. She didn’t care.”

Compare how each voice changes the scene’s mood.  Why: The narrator’s personality adds flavor and sets the tone. A mismatched voice (e.g., a cheerful narrator in a horror story) can confuse readers.  Step 4: Test Your Choice
Write a short scene (200–300 words) using your chosen narrator. Then ask:  Does this narrator make the scene feel the way I intended?  
Is the reader getting the right amount of information?  
Does the voice feel consistent?

If the answer to any of these is “no,” tweak the narrator’s tone, distance, or perspective.  Why: Testing helps you see if your narrator is working. Beginners often stick with their first choice out of habit, but experimenting early saves time in revisions.DEEP DIVE: TACTICAL USES OF EACH NARRATOR TYPELet’s break down how to use each narrator type strategically, with examples and tips for beginners.First-Person Narrators: Intimacy and Manipulation
First-person puts readers inside the narrator’s head, making it ideal for emotional connection or deception.  Confessional Mode: The narrator is baring their soul, often with regret or justification. Example: In The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky, Charlie’s letters feel like a diary, creating intimacy and vulnerability.  Tactic: Use short, fragmented sentences to mimic raw emotion. “I didn’t mean to hurt her. I swear. It just happened.”  
Why: This makes readers feel like they’re trusted with a secret, building empathy.

Delusional Mode: The narrator believes their version of events, but readers see cracks. Example: In American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis, Patrick Bateman’s polished narration hides his psychopathy, but details (like his obsession with music) reveal his instability.  Tactic: Drop subtle hints that contradict the narrator’s claims. “I’m fine, really. The blood on my shirt? Just paint.”  
Why: This creates dramatic irony, keeping readers engaged as they piece together the truth.

Weaponized Mode: The narrator manipulates the reader to take their side. Example: In Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov, Humbert Humbert’s eloquent voice tries to justify his actions, making readers complicit until they realize his depravity.  Tactic: Use persuasive language but include details that undermine the narrator. “I loved her purely, but her defiance forced my hand.”  
Why: This challenges readers’ morals, creating a complex, unsettling experience.

Actionable Tip: If you’re writing first-person, write a paragraph where your narrator explains why they’re telling this story. Even if you don’t include it in the final draft, this clarifies their agenda and keeps their voice consistent.Third-Person Narrators: Flexibility and Control
Third-person offers a range of distances, from close (inside the character’s thoughts) to distant (observing externally).  Close Third-Person: Feels like first-person but with more flexibility. Example: In Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, the third-person limited narrator stays close to Harry’s perspective, making his fears and triumphs vivid.  Tactic: Use the character’s language in descriptions. If Harry sees a “creepy shadow,” the narrator calls it that, not a “menacing silhouette.”  
Why: This creates intimacy while allowing you to describe things the character wouldn’t say aloud.

Distant Third-Person: Observes actions without diving deep into thoughts. Example: In The Road by Cormac McCarthy, the distant narrator mirrors the bleak, detached world, making emotions feel restrained yet powerful.  Tactic: Focus on physical actions and sparse details. “He walked. The road stretched empty before him.”  
Why: Distance can amplify desolation or suspense by withholding emotional clarity.

Switching Perspectives: In multi-POV stories, the narrator shifts between characters. Example: In A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin, the third-person limited narrator jumps between characters, building a complex world while maintaining suspense.  Tactic: Give each character’s POV a distinct narrative voice. If one character is poetic, their sections use metaphors; if another is pragmatic, their sections are blunt.  
Why: This prevents confusion and makes each character’s perspective memorable.

Actionable Tip: Write a scene in third-person, then adjust the distance. First, make it as close as possible (e.g., “Her heart pounded as the door creaked”). Then, make it distant (e.g., “She stood by the door as it opened”). Notice how distance changes the mood.Omniscient Narrators: Scope and Authority
Omniscient narrators know everything, but the challenge is deciding what to reveal and how.  Example: In Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, the omniscient narrator has a witty, judgmental tone, commenting on characters’ flaws while guiding readers to root for Elizabeth and Darcy.  Tactic: Use a consistent narrative voice to comment subtly. “Mr. Darcy’s pride, though well-earned, blinded him to her charm.”  
Why: The narrator’s commentary shapes the reader’s moral lens, adding humor or irony.

Common Mistake: Beginners often use omniscience to dump information. Instead, reveal only what enhances the moment. Example: Don’t say, “Elizabeth hated Darcy because of his rude comment at the ball.” Say, “Elizabeth’s smile tightened as Darcy’s words from the ball echoed in her mind.”  Actionable Tip: Write a paragraph where the omniscient narrator knows a key detail no character does (e.g., a betrayal coming). Hint at it without stating it outright. This builds dread and keeps readers hooked.Second-Person Narrators: Risk and Reward
Second-person is rare but powerful when used purposefully.  Intimacy: Makes readers feel like the protagonist. Example: In Bright Lights, Big City by Jay McInerney, the “you” narrator immerses readers in the protagonist’s chaotic, drug-fueled life.  Tactic: Use sensory details to pull readers in. “You taste the whiskey’s burn, feel the bass thumping in your chest.”  
Why: This creates a visceral, personal experience.

Disorientation: Questions identity or reality. Example: In If on a winter’s night a traveler by Italo Calvino, the “you” narrator blurs the line between reader and character, creating a meta experience.  Tactic: Use ambiguous language. “You open the book, or maybe it opens you.”  
Why: This challenges readers’ assumptions, perfect for experimental or psychological stories.

Common Mistake: Beginners use second-person for shock value without a clear purpose. Only use it if it serves your story’s goal.  Actionable Tip: Write a short scene in second-person, focusing on a specific emotion (e.g., guilt: “You can’t look at her, knowing what you’ve done”). If it feels forced, switch to another POV.COMMON PITFALLS AND HOW TO AVOID THEMBeginners often trip up when choosing a narrator because they don’t think tactically. Here’s how to spot and fix these issues.Pitfall 1: Choosing Based on Comfort
You pick first-person because it’s “easier” or third-person because it’s “safer.” This leads to a narrator that doesn’t serve the story.  Fix: Always tie your choice to the story’s goal. If you’re writing a romance and want readers to feel the protagonist’s longing, first-person or close third-person is better than omniscient.  Why: Comfort doesn’t equal effectiveness. A narrator should challenge you to tell the story in the most impactful way.Pitfall 2: Inconsistent Perspective Shifts
You switch POVs mid-scene without a clear reason, confusing readers. Example: “She hated the party. He thought it was dull too.” Who’s narrating now?  Fix: Stick to one POV per scene (or use clear breaks in omniscient). If you switch, ensure the narrator’s voice signals the change.  Why: Consistency keeps readers grounded. Random shifts feel sloppy and break immersion.Pitfall 3: Overusing Omniscient Exposition
You use omniscience to explain everything, killing suspense.
Example: “She didn’t know he was cheating, but he’d been doing it for years.”  Fix: Show, don’t tell. “She laughed at his joke, unaware of the texts lighting up his phone.”  Why: Over-explanation robs readers of discovery. Let the narrator tease, not spoil.Pitfall 4: Weak Second-Person
You use second-person without a clear purpose, making it feel gimmicky.  Fix: Only use second-person if it enhances the story’s emotional or thematic impact. Test it by rewriting in first or third to see if it’s truly necessary.  Why: Second-person demands purpose. Without it, it feels like a stunt.EXERCISE: TEST YOUR NARRATOR CHOICETo practice tactical narrator selection, try this exercise:  Pick a simple scene (e.g., a character receiving bad news).  
Write it four ways:  First-person confessional: “I couldn’t breathe when she told me he was gone.”  
First-person delusional: “She said he was gone, but she’s wrong. He’ll call tomorrow.”  
Third-person close: “Her hands shook as the words sank in, heavy and final.”  
Omniscient: “She stood frozen as the news broke, unaware that across town, another tragedy was unfolding.”

Read each version. Which best conveys the emotion you want? Which controls information most effectively?

Why: This helps you see how narrator choice shapes the story. Beginners often stick with one POV without exploring options. This exercise builds flexibility.SAMPLE SCENE: TACTICAL NARRATOR CHOICESHere’s a scene written three ways to show how narrator choice changes the effect.  Scene Setup: A teenager, Mia, sneaks out at night to meet her friend.  First-Person (Confessional):
I slipped out the window, heart pounding like it might wake Mom. The street was quiet, too quiet, but I ran anyway. I had to see Jake. I owed him an apology, even if it killed me.  Effect: Intimate, urgent. Readers feel Mia’s guilt and fear, connecting with her emotionally.  Third-Person Close:
Mia’s sneakers scraped the windowsill as she climbed out, her pulse racing. The street stretched dark and silent, but Jake was waiting. She owed him that much, no matter the cost.  Effect: Still intimate but slightly less raw. The narrator adds a hint of context (“no matter the cost”), building suspense.  Omniscient:
Mia crept out her window, unaware that her mother stirred upstairs. 
The night hid her, but it also hid the figure watching from the alley. Jake waited at the park, his own secrets heavier than hers.  Effect: Broad, foreboding. The narrator’s knowledge creates dread, hinting at danger Mia doesn’t see.  Why This Matters: Each narrator serves a different purpose. First-person builds empathy; close third adds flexibility; omniscient creates scope. Choose based on your story’s needs, not habit.FINAL TIPS FOR BEGINNING WRITERSStart with Intent: Always know why you’re choosing a narrator. Write a one-sentence justification before starting (e.g., “I’m using first-person to make the reader feel the protagonist’s paranoia”).  
Read with Purpose: Study narrators in books you love. The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe (first-person, delusional) or The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien (omniscient, epic) are great places to start. Underline where the narrator’s choices shape the story.  
Revise Strategically: After writing a draft, check if the narrator enhances the story’s goal. If not, experiment with a different POV or tone.  
Embrace Experimentation: Don’t be afraid to try something bold, like second-person or an unreliable narrator. Even if it fails, you’ll learn what works.  
Practice Control: Every sentence is a chance to guide the reader. Practice writing scenes where the narrator deliberately withholds or reveals key details to see how it changes the impact.

Choosing a narrator isn’t about picking a POV that feels “right.” It’s about selecting a weapon that delivers the exact experience you want your reader to have. Whether you’re trapping them in a character’s mind with first-person, building suspense with third-person, or wielding godlike authority with omniscient, your narrator is a tactical tool. As a beginner, you have the power to shape your story’s emotional and intellectual impact—use it deliberately.Practice the exercises in this post. Experiment with different narrators. Study how your favorite authors wield their narrators. Most importantly, don’t default to what’s easy. Design your narrator to make your story hit hard, linger long, and leave readers wanting more. Your narrator isn’t just telling the story—it’s shaping the reader’s reality
