Designing for Indulgence
Most writers try to “sneak” themselves into their stories.

They let their personality show in the cracks.
A joke here. A favorite band in the background. A character who rants a little too much like they do when they’re drunk.

But the rest? They build like good students. Respect the structure. Obey the form. Stick to the plan.

That’s the problem.

They treat indulgence like a side effect, when it could be the engine.

If the last six parts were about recognizing, allowing, and refining indulgence, this one is about building for it. On purpose. From the start.

You don’t need to “let yourself leak in.”

You need to design your process around the fact that your world matters.

Here’s how.

🧱 1. Build Space Into Your Premise
Start by asking: Where do I show up in this?

If you can’t answer that in the first 60 seconds, you’re setting yourself up for a story that’s hollow.

Before you write a word of plot, try these:

What part of my taste can live here?

(The music. The food. The weather. The texture.)

What belief is this story picking a fight with?

(Even if it’s one I secretly hold.)

What do I wish I could say with this story—if nobody ever found out I wrote it?

What’s the scene I’m most excited to write?

(And how can I plant the story around that?)

If your answers feel dull, stop building. You don’t need a story that works. You need a story that wants you in it.

If nothing feels personal, you’ll burn out before you hit page 10.

🧪 2. Create Experiments, Not Just Drafts
Too many writers treat drafts like sacred progress.
First draft, second draft, polish pass, etc.

Forget that for a minute.

Try this instead:

Write three versions of the same scene:
One safe, one reckless, one ridiculous.
Compare them. What jumps out in the reckless one?

Write a character only using your worst traits.
Then make them win.

Write a monologue with no filter. Not clever. Not subtle. Just the shit you’ve been scared to say for years.

Write your indulgent scene first.
Not when you’ve “earned it.” First. Use it to build outward.

You don’t need to make every experiment part of the final book. But if you’re not experimenting, you’re just typing.

Design time for indulgence.
Put it on the schedule.

🎭 3. Assign Yourself Roles in the Story
You’re not just the writer. You’re also:

The ghost behind a character

The judge behind a system

The camera behind the mood

The voice behind the style

The limit behind the world

So stop pretending you’re invisible. Start choosing how you show up.

Example:
If the world in your story has a broken justice system, what’s your role in that world?
Are you the disillusioned priest? The satirist? The whisper in the jury room?

Give yourself a role.
Don’t just write the story. Walk around inside it.

The stories that stick are the ones where the writer feels present—even if they never appear on the page.

🏗 4. Engineer Moments That Indulge on Purpose
Design scenes to feed you.

That means:

Write a sensory overload scene just for the pleasure of it.

Include a character whose only job is to say the shit you always censor.

Write a moment of joy that doesn’t forward the plot but lets someone feel good—because you needed to feel good writing it.

Include the joke that makes only you laugh.

Design a setting that’s your dream environment, even if it’s “unnecessary.”

This is where people get squeamish.

They say, “But what if it’s too much?”

The answer is:
So what?
You’re not designing for approval. You’re designing for contact.

Every writer gets tired. Burned out. Blocked.

But you’ll block less if your own story feeds you back.

If you know there’s a scene coming up that’s yours—really yours—you’ll keep going.

Indulgence isn’t just a flavor. It’s a power source.

So build plugs for it into every part of the story.

🧨 5. Let Something Feel Dangerous
Pick one part of your story that’s not for anyone but you.
Not for readers. Not for agents. Not for workshops.

It could be:

A secret motif

A rant that nobody else will get

A nod to something painful

A truth that still stings

A fantasy that makes you squirm

Whatever it is—don’t explain it. Don’t justify it. Just put it in.

Why?

Because it’s yours.
And the second you write only for others, your story starts losing blood.

Design with danger in mind.
Let the story threaten your comfort a little. Let it poke at your reputation. Let it go places that make you sweat.

You don’t owe anyone a clean version of yourself.

✍️ Final Method: The Reverse Workshop
Before you “fix” anything, try this exercise.

Take a scene or chapter.

Circle every moment where you felt:

Nervous to write it

Surprised by your own voice

Embarrassed but proud

Like you were having fun

Label those as “Indulgent On Purpose.”

Protect them.

Only after that should you start “improving” anything.

Too many writers cut what made the story real in the name of craft.

You can polish without erasing yourself.
You can tighten without sterilizing.

You just have to recognize what you’re tempted to kill—and stop.

Design for that.


You don’t have to write books that are wild, unhinged, or confessional.
You don’t have to be raw all the time.
You don’t even have to be obvious about your indulgence.

But you do have to write like you exist.

Like your world matters. Like your obsessions matter. Like your taste matters.

Because it makes the story yours.

So design for indulgence. Bake it into the architecture.
Let your characters smell like your childhood. Let the wallpaper be your favorite color. Let the story run on the fuel of what only you can say.

Write like nobody else can touch it.

Because when your world shows up on the page—loud, flawed, cringey, yours—that’s when it lives.
