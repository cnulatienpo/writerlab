# **Writing Theme with Heart: A Deep Dive into *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland***  

Theme isn’t just an intellectual exercise—it’s the soul of your story. It’s the thing that makes readers *feel* something long after they’ve forgotten the plot. And if you’re a writer, theme isn’t just something you *apply*—it’s something you *discover*, wrestle with, and ultimately pour onto the page like a confession.  

In the first part of this analysis, we broke down *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland* through the lens of **order vs. chaos**, tracking how every scene, character, and image reinforces that tension. But now, let’s go deeper—into the *why*, the *how*, and most importantly, the *what it feels like* to write theme.  

This isn’t about rigid rules. It’s about finding what *you* want to say and saying it in a way that resonates.

## **Part 1: Theme as an Emotional Compass**  

### **Why Theme Feels Like Magic (And Sometimes Like a Fight)**  
When you’re writing with theme in mind, it’s not just about checking boxes—**it’s about following a feeling**.  

- **Theme as a Magnet:** When you know your core tension (order vs. chaos, freedom vs. safety, love vs. duty), scenes *pull* toward it naturally. Alice doesn’t just fall down a rabbit hole—she *chooses* chaos over the stifling order of her world. That’s not just plot; it’s emotional gravity.  
- **Theme as a Fight:** Sometimes, the story resists. You’ll write scenes that feel flat, dialogue that’s too on-the-nose, or characters who don’t *quite* embody the theme. That’s okay. Writing theme is iterative—you draft, you feel the disconnect, you rewrite until it *clicks*.  
- **Theme as a Secret:** The best themes aren’t announced; they’re whispered. The Caterpillar doesn’t say, “Alice, this is a story about embracing chaos.” He says, **“Who are *you*?”**—and that question *is* the theme.  

### **What It Feels Like to Write a Thematic Scene**  
Let’s take **The Mad Hatter’s Tea Party**. If you’re writing this scene with the **order vs. chaos** theme in mind, here’s how it might unfold in your head:  

1. **The Setup:** Alice arrives expecting a normal tea party (order). What she gets is madness (chaos).  
2. **The Tension:** She tries to be polite (her Victorian upbringing), but the Hatter and March Hare keep derailing her (chaos winning).  
3. **The Emotional Beat:** Frustration builds—*Why won’t they just follow the rules?*—until she finally gives up and leaves. That’s the moment the theme *hurts*.  

**What You’re Feeling as the Writer:**  
- *Am I being too obvious?* (No—readers *feel* the chaos, they don’t need it explained.)  
- *Is this scene doing enough?* (Yes—it’s another step in Alice’s journey from control to surrender.)  
- *Does it* matter *that she leaves?* (Yes—because it’s a small defeat that leads to her final triumph.)  

Writing theme isn’t about being perfect. It’s about *feeling* the imbalance, the tension, the *ache* of the central question.

## **Part 2: Theme in the Guts of the Story**  

### **How Characters Become Vessels for Theme**  
Characters aren’t just people—they’re **embodiments of the theme’s warring sides**.  

| Character        | Role in Theme (Order vs. Chaos) | What They Teach Alice |  
|------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|  
| **White Rabbit** | Chaos disguised as order (he’s frantic but obsessed with time) | The illusion of control |  
| **Queen of Hearts** | Tyrannical order (rules without reason) | Blind obedience is just another kind of madness |  
| **Cheshire Cat** | Pure chaos (grinning, disappearing, speaking in riddles) | Sometimes, you have to embrace the absurd |  

**What It Feels Like to Write Them:**  
- The Queen isn’t just a villain—she’s the *dark side of order*. When you write her, you’re tapping into that fear of authority figures who make no sense.  
- The Cheshire Cat isn’t just whimsical—he’s *liberating*. Writing him feels like breaking rules on purpose.  

### **Dialogue That Whispers Theme**  
Bad thematic dialogue: **“This world is so chaotic, I just want order!”**  
Good thematic dialogue: **“I can’t explain myself, I’m afraid, sir, because I’m not myself, you see.”**  

- Alice’s confusion *is* the theme.  
- The Hatter’s riddles *are* the theme.  
- The Queen’s “Off with their heads!” *is* the theme.  

**What You’re Feeling as the Writer:**  
- *Is this too subtle?* (No—trust your readers.)  
- *Does this sound natural?* (Yes—because people don’t announce their inner conflicts; they *live* them.)

## **Part 3: Thematic Imagery—Painting Emotion with Objects**  

Theme isn’t just in words; it’s in **what you show**.  

| Symbol          | How It Embodies Theme |  
|-----------------|------------------------|  
| **Pocket Watch** | Time is broken in Wonderland—just like Alice’s sense of order |  
| **Growing/Shrinking** | She’s either too big or too small—never in control |  
| **Playing Cards** | Flimsy structures that collapse—just like rigid rules |  

**What It Feels Like to Write Symbolism:**  
- You’re not *assigning* meaning—you’re *discovering* it. The first time Alice shrinks, it’s scary. The tenth time, it’s a pattern. By the trial, when she grows *on purpose*, it’s triumph.  
- You’ll feel like you’re weaving a spell. Because you are.

## **Part 4: The Big Secret—Theme Is Personal**  

Here’s the truth: **You don’t choose your theme. It chooses you.**  

- Lewis Carroll wasn’t just writing a silly story—he was wrestling with Victorian rigidity, logic, and the absurdity of adulthood.  
- When you write, your fears, hopes, and unresolved questions seep in. That’s *good*.  

**What It Feels Like to Write *Your* Theme:**  
- It’s scary. (What if people see *me* in this?)  
- It’s thrilling. (This *matters*.)  
- It’s exhausting. (Why can’t I get this *right*?)  
- It’s worth it.

## **Final Thought: Write Like Alice**  

Alice doesn’t conquer Wonderland. She doesn’t “solve” chaos. She **learns to navigate it**.  

That’s what writing theme is like. You don’t *master* it—you *dance* with it. Sometimes it leads. Sometimes you stumble. But by the end, you’ve told a story that *means* something.  

And that’s the real magic.

**Now go write.**

**Expanded Analysis (Continued)**  

### **Part 5: Thematic Structure – Building a Cohesive Narrative**  

A story’s theme isn’t just present in individual scenes—it’s woven into the very structure of the narrative. Let’s break down how *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland* uses its three-act structure to reinforce the **order vs. chaos** theme.  

#### **Act 1: The Descent into Chaos**  
- **Key Scenes:** The Riverbank, The Rabbit Hole, The Hall of Doors  
- **Theme in Action:** Alice’s initial world is one of strict order (Victorian society). Her choice to follow the White Rabbit is her first step into chaos.  
- **Writer’s Insight:** This act sets up the central question—*Can Alice find meaning in a world that defies logic?* As a writer, you’re establishing the stakes of the theme.  

#### **Act 2: The Struggle with Chaos**  
- **Key Scenes:** The Pool of Tears, The Caucus Race, The Mad Hatter’s Tea Party  
- **Theme in Action:** Alice tries to impose order (e.g., asking for rules at the tea party) but is repeatedly thwarted. Each failure deepens her internal conflict.  
- **Writer’s Insight:** This is where the theme *hurts*. You’re putting your protagonist through the wringer, forcing them to confront the theme in increasingly difficult ways.  

#### **Act 3: The Resolution – Embracing Balance**  
- **Key Scenes:** The Queen’s Croquet Game, The Trial, Waking Up  
- **Theme in Action:** Alice stops trying to control Wonderland and instead asserts her own agency. She doesn’t reject chaos entirely—she learns to navigate it.  
- **Writer’s Insight:** The resolution doesn’t have to be a clear “win.” It’s about the protagonist finding a new equilibrium with the theme.

### **Part 6: Exercises to Strengthen Your Thematic Writing**  

1. **Rewrite a Scene with Theme in Mind**  
   - Take a scene from your WIP and rewrite it so the theme is only implied through action or dialogue (no exposition).  

2. **Create a Theme Tracker**  
   - For each scene in your story, note how it advances the theme (e.g., “Protagonist resists change” or “Antagonist embodies the dark side of the theme”).  

3. **Explore Symbolism**  
   - Choose an object in your story (like Alice’s pocket watch) and brainstorm how it can reflect the theme in different ways.

### **Part 7: Comparing Themes Across Stories**  

To deepen your understanding of theme, let’s compare *Alice* with *The Wizard of Oz*.  

| Story                | Core Theme              | How It’s Expressed          |  
|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|  
| *Alice in Wonderland* | Order vs. Chaos         | Alice navigates a nonsensical world, finding her own balance. |  
| *The Wizard of Oz*    | Home vs. Adventure      | Dorothy learns that “home” isn’t just a place—it’s a state of belonging. |  

**Takeaway:** Both stories use fantastical settings to explore universal emotional struggles. The key is to make your theme *personal* to your characters.

### **Part 8: The Emotional Journey of Writing Theme**  

Writing theme isn’t a mechanical process—it’s an emotional one. Here’s what you might experience at each stage:  

1. **Discovery Phase**  
   - *Feeling:* Uncertainty. You’re not sure what your story is *really* about.  
   - *Solution:* Free-write about what fascinates or terrifies you. Your theme is often hidden there.  

2. **Drafting Phase**  
   - *Feeling:* Frustration. Some scenes will feel “off” because they don’t align with the theme.  
   - *Solution:* Trust your gut. If a scene feels hollow, ask, *How does this connect to the core tension?*  

3. **Revision Phase**  
   - *Feeling:* Excitement. You start seeing patterns and connections you didn’t plan.  
   - *Solution:* Lean into those moments—they’re where the magic happens.

## **Final Thought: Your Theme, Your Voice**  

Theme isn’t about following a formula—it’s about uncovering the heart of your story. Whether you’re writing a whimsical fantasy like *Alice* or a gritty drama, the process is the same:  

1. **Find the tension that matters to you.**  
2. **Let it guide your characters, scenes, and symbols.**  
3. **Trust that your readers will feel it, even if they can’t articulate it.**
