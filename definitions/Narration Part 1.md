Narration Part 1: The Narrator Is Not Your Friend
Most writers treat the narrator like a tour guide—someone polite, neutral, invisible. The job is to walk us through the story, point out some nice sights, and stay out of the way. But that’s not what a narrator is, and it’s definitely not what a narrator does. The narrator isn’t a guide. The narrator is a gatekeeper, a manipulator, a loaded weapon.

A narrator decides what you see, what you don’t, and how you’re supposed to feel about it. The narrator is the camera, the lighting, the soundtrack, and the editor. If you’re not using your narrator like a tool, someone else is using you.

Let’s make this real.

THE BASICS YOU THINK YOU KNOW
Here’s the version most people get taught in school:

First-person = “I walked into the room”

Second-person = “You walk into the room”

Third-person limited = “He walked into the room” (but we only know what he knows)

Third-person omniscient = “He walked into the room” (but we also know what everyone else is doing and thinking)

These are point of view options. They’re not narrators. They’re camera placement.

The narrator is the actual entity delivering the story. It might be a character. It might be an offscreen observer. It might be a silent, all-knowing voice that never slips up. But it’s never nothing. Someone is always doing the telling.

And that someone has an agenda.

CONTROL IS THE WHOLE GAME
Writing is control. Every sentence is a decision about what the reader sees, hears, knows, or misunderstands. The narrator is the voice that carries out those decisions. So if you’re not controlling your narrator, your narrator is controlling you.

Example. Let’s say you have a character named Maya, and you write this:

Maya sat down on the porch. She didn’t say anything, but her eyes scanned the street for his car. She told herself she was done waiting.

The tea went cold.

Seems simple, right? Third-person limited. Feels close to Maya. Looks like basic description. But what’s really happening?

The narrator is selecting Maya’s emotional state to show us.

The narrator doesn’t tell us where “he” is or what he’s doing.

The sentence “She told herself she was done waiting” implies doubt. The narrator undercuts Maya.

The tea going cold is a symbol. The narrator added that to frame the moment.

None of that is neutral. That is curated information. This narrator is shaping how we feel about Maya. Maybe we’re supposed to feel for her. Maybe we’re supposed to see she’s in denial. Maybe both. Either way—it’s not a documentary.

THE NARRATOR HAS POWER
Let’s define what a narrator actually does. They:

Filter information
What gets shown, what gets hidden, what gets delayed.

Control tone
Is this funny? Dry? Melodramatic? The narrator decides.

Shape interpretation
Is a character sympathetic or annoying? Depends on how their story is told.

Direct reader attention
Just like a camera—focus here, blur that out.

Create tension or trust
Readers don’t trust the character. They trust the narrator. For now.

When writers don’t take this seriously, they end up writing like they’re just transcribing events. No tension, no slant, no awareness that they’re actually delivering an experience. You’re not writing what happened. You’re deciding how it’s perceived.

INVISIBLE ≠ NEUTRAL
A lot of writers think third-person limited is “invisible.” That it lets the story speak for itself.

Nope.

Even in third limited, you’re still filtering reality. You’re still choosing which thoughts to include. You’re still deciding how closely we track to someone’s emotions. You’re still deciding what language is used to describe the world—the character’s language, or someone else’s?

“The house was a squat little dump with no air-conditioning.”

vs.

“The cottage was modest, but shaded by oak trees.”

Same house. Different narrator tone. One’s contemptuous. One’s generous. That’s not about POV. That’s about narrative attitude.

OMNISCIENT ISN’T “GOD MODE”
Omniscient narration gets misused constantly. People treat it like free reign to dump in any thought, reveal every secret, summarize every backstory. What they forget is that even in omniscient, someone is still telling the story.

Think of a voice like a Victorian narrator (Dickens, Tolstoy), who isn’t just stating facts—they’re framing morality. They comment. They shape. They give opinion.

Or think of a modern omniscient narrator who floats between minds but never forgets who’s suffering more, who’s hiding something, who the reader should pay attention to. They don’t just share information—they angle it.

Omniscient isn’t permission to stop making choices. It just changes the kind of choices you have to make.

EXAMPLES THAT ACTUALLY USE THE NARRATOR
Let’s break down some books that use the narrator as a tool—not a neutral channel.

A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket
The narrator hates that the story is sad. He warns you to stop reading. He inserts himself constantly. But you trust him anyway, because he’s consistent. He’s emotionally invested in the pain, not exploiting it.

Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk
First-person narrator, right? Seems straightforward. Until you realize he’s hiding massive parts of the truth—from you and from himself. Unreliable narrator not as a twist, but as a structural choice.

The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro
First-person again, but this narrator is deeply repressed. He doesn’t lie. He just can’t feel what he lived through. The emotional tragedy is delivered through what’s omitted. That’s narration as irony.

The Book Thief by Markus Zusak
Death is the narrator. Literally. Death tells you who’s going to die before it happens. There’s no suspense—just dread. That’s a narrator replacing plot tension with emotional inevitability.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU IGNORE THIS
When writers don’t understand their narrator, their writing starts to feel flat, contradictory, or confusing.

Here’s what goes wrong:

The narrator accidentally sounds like the author.

Tone shifts mid-book without any structural reason.

Key info is revealed too early or too late—just because the writer didn’t think about who’s choosing when to say it.

Close POV characters start thinking in ways that don’t match the prose.

Or worst of all—everything sounds the same. No voice, no flavor, no frame.

If your story could be told in bullet points and still feel the same, you’ve got a narrator problem.

QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF BEFORE YOU START
You don’t need to write this all out in your outline, but you should know the answers.

Who is telling this story?

Why now?

What do they know that the characters don’t?

What do they want the reader to believe?

Are they reliable? If not, what are they hiding?

What’s their tone toward the events?

What does their voice add that the dialogue doesn’t?

This doesn’t mean every story needs a flashy narrator. But every story does need a consistent one.

WRITING EXERCISE: SPOT THE NARRATOR
Take a paragraph you’ve already written. Now do these three things:

Underline anything that sounds like it came from the narrator’s mouth, not the character’s mind.
Anything with judgment, tone, metaphor, or flair. Ask: Whose words are these?

Write it again—but with a bitter narrator.
Same POV, same events, but the narrator is sick of this character’s shit.

Write it again—but with a kind narrator.
Not naïve—just generous. They see the struggle. They want to believe the best.

Notice how much shifts even when the POV stays the same. That’s narrator control. That’s what you need to get good at.

As a beginning writer, you might feel overwhelmed by the idea of a narrator having so much power. You’re probably thinking, “I just want to tell my story!” But here’s the thing: the story doesn’t exist until the narrator shapes it. Beginners often make the mistake of assuming the narrator is just a vehicle for delivering plot points. This leads to stories that feel like summaries—dry, lifeless, and forgettable.Why does this happen? Because new writers often focus on what happens (the plot) instead of how it’s told (the narration). Imagine you’re describing a car crash. You could write, “The car hit the tree.” That’s the event. But the narrator decides whether it’s: “The car slammed into the ancient oak with a sickening crunch, as if the tree itself groaned in pain.” 
Or: “The car skidded, then crashed into the tree, a minor inconvenience for a driver already late.”

The first version makes the crash visceral, dramatic. The second downplays it, maybe even with a hint of sarcasm. Same event, different narrators. As a beginner, your job is to practice making these choices deliberately.Why It Matters: A weak narrator makes your story feel generic. A strong narrator makes it unforgettable. Even if your plot is simple, the narrator’s voice can make it stand out. Think of a fairy tale like “Little Red Riding Hood.” The plot is basic: girl goes to grandma’s, meets wolf, drama ensues. But a grim, foreboding narrator versus a whimsical, playful one changes the entire experience.Actionable Tip: When you sit down to write, don’t just think about what’s happening in the scene. Ask yourself, “How do I want the reader to feel about this moment?” Write down one adjective (e.g., tense, funny, heartbreaking) and let that guide your narrator’s word choice and focus.BUILDING A NARRATOR FROM SCRATCHLet’s walk through how to create a narrator that serves your story. As a beginner, you might not know where to start, so here’s a step-by-step process to develop a narrator with purpose.Step 1: Define the Narrator’s Role
Is your narrator a character in the story (first-person)? An outside observer (third-person limited or omniscient)? Or something experimental, like an object or a concept (e.g., Death in The Book Thief)? Decide this early, because it shapes everything else.  Example: In The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, the narrator is Holden Caulfield, a teenage boy who’s cynical, emotional, and unreliable. His voice—slangy, judgmental, raw—defines the book’s tone. If Salinger had used a neutral third-person narrator, the story would lose its edge.  Why: The narrator’s role determines how much they know and how they share it. A first-person narrator can only reveal what they experience, which creates intimacy but limits scope. An omniscient narrator can reveal everything but risks feeling detached if not handled carefully.Step 2: Give the Narrator a Personality
Even if your narrator isn’t a character, they need a distinct voice. Are they sarcastic? Poetic? Detached? Warm? This personality shapes the tone of the story.  Exercise: Write a single sentence about a rainy day from three different narrators:  A bitter narrator: “The rain hammered the town like it had a personal grudge, soaking everything in misery.”  
A cheerful narrator: “Rain danced on the rooftops, turning the streets into a sparkling playground.”  
A neutral narrator: “Rain fell steadily, pooling in the gutters and wetting the pavement.”

Notice how the same event feels different? That’s the narrator’s personality at work. As a beginner, practice writing the same scene with different narrative tones to see how it changes the reader’s experience.Why: A narrator’s personality adds flavor to your story. It’s what makes your writing feel unique, even if the plot is familiar. Think of Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, where the omniscient narrator is witty and slightly cheeky, making even mundane moments hilarious.Step 3: Decide What the Narrator Knows
Does your narrator know everything (omniscient), only what one character knows (limited), or are they deliberately hiding things (unreliable)? This choice affects how you reveal information to the reader.  Example: In Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, the first-person narrators (Nick and Amy) are both unreliable. They withhold key details, shaping how we perceive their marriage. The narrator’s omissions create suspense and force us to question what’s true.  Why: Controlling information is how you build tension. If your narrator reveals too much too soon, the story feels predictable. If they hold back strategically, the reader stays hooked. For beginners, this means planning what your narrator will reveal and when.  Actionable Tip: Create a “narrator cheat sheet” before you start writing. Answer:  What does the narrator know that the characters don’t?  
What will they reveal immediately, and what will they delay?  
How does their tone (e.g., sarcastic, empathetic) shape the story?

This cheat sheet keeps your narrator consistent and purposeful.Step 4: Match the Narrator to the Story’s Goal
Your narrator should serve the story’s emotional or thematic purpose. If you’re writing a tragic love story, a snarky narrator might undermine the mood. If it’s a satire, a somber narrator could feel out of place.  Example: In The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, the omniscient narrator is dryly humorous, treating galaxy-destroying events with casual absurdity. This matches the book’s goal: to poke fun at science fiction tropes.  Why: A mismatched narrator can confuse readers or dilute the story’s impact. As a beginner, you might not know your story’s goal yet, but you can start by asking, “What’s the one feeling or idea I want readers to take away?” Let that guide your narrator’s tone and focus.COMMON NARRATOR MISTAKES (AND HOW TO FIX THEM)Beginners often stumble with narration because they don’t realize how much control they have. Here are common pitfalls and how to avoid them, with specific fixes.Mistake 1: Inconsistent Tone
Your narrator’s tone shifts randomly—sarcastic one page, poetic the next—without a clear reason. This confuses readers and makes the story feel disjointed.  Example: You’re writing a gritty crime novel, and your third-person narrator describes a murder scene with hard-edged, blunt language: “Blood pooled under the body, sticky and dark.” Then, a few pages later, the narrator waxes lyrical: “The moonlight caressed the cobblestones with a tender glow.” The shift feels jarring unless it’s deliberate (e.g., reflecting a character’s changing mood).  Fix: Choose one primary tone for your narrator and stick to it unless the shift serves the story. Write a one-sentence description of your narrator’s attitude (e.g., “Cynical and blunt, like a tired detective”). Check every scene against this description. If the tone shifts, justify it (e.g., “The narrator softens when describing the victim to show empathy”).  Why: Consistency builds trust. Readers rely on the narrator to guide them emotionally. Random shifts break that trust.Mistake 2: Overloading with Information
Beginners often use the narrator to dump backstory or explain everything upfront, especially in omniscient POV. This kills suspense and overwhelms readers.  Example: “John walked into the bar, a place he hadn’t visited since his divorce five years ago when his wife left him for his best friend, which led to his drinking problem and eventual job loss.” This tells us too much too fast, leaving no mystery.  Fix: Use the “iceberg principle”: show only 10% of the information and hint at the rest. Rewrite the example: “John hesitated at the bar’s door, the smell of whiskey stirring memories he’d rather forget.” This implies a past without spelling it out.  Why: Holding back information creates curiosity. Readers want to piece things together themselves. As a beginner, practice revealing just enough to keep the reader engaged, not satisfied.Mistake 3: Narrator as Author Proxy
Sometimes, the narrator sounds like you venting or preaching, not a distinct voice serving the story.

This pulls readers out of the narrative.  Example: In a story about a dystopian society, the narrator says, “This government was clearly corrupt, just like the ones we see in real life.” That’s you, the writer, talking, not the narrator.  Fix: Ensure the narrator’s voice aligns with the story’s world and purpose. If the narrator has opinions, they should feel organic to the narrative. Rewrite: “The government’s decrees hung heavy over the city, each law tightening the noose on its people.” This conveys corruption without breaking the fourth wall.  Why: Readers want immersion, not a lecture. A narrator who sounds like the author feels artificial and disrupts the story’s flow.Mistake 4: Ignoring the Narrator’s Bias
Every narrator has a perspective, even in third-person. Beginners often write as if the narrator is a neutral robot, which flattens the story.  Example: “Sarah was angry at Tom for lying.” This is bland and tells us how to feel without earning it. A biased narrator might say, “Sarah’s jaw tightened as Tom’s lie hung in the air, another betrayal she should’ve seen coming.” This shows her anger and hints at a history, letting readers interpret.  Fix: Always ask, “What does the narrator think of this moment?” Even in third-person limited, the narrator can subtly favor one character or judgment. Practice writing scenes where the narrator has a slight bias—admiration, pity, or skepticism—and see how it shapes the reader’s view.  Why: Bias adds depth. A narrator who subtly judges or empathizes makes the story feel alive and human, not like a Wikipedia entry.ADVANCED TECHNIQUES FOR BEGINNERSOnce you’re comfortable with the basics, try these techniques to make your narrator more dynamic. These are beginner-friendly but push you to think creatively.Technique 1: Use the Narrator to Create Subtext
Subtext is what’s unsaid—the emotions or truths lurking beneath the surface. A skilled narrator can hint at these without spelling them out.  Example: Instead of “Anna was heartbroken,” write: “Anna smiled tightly, her fingers tracing the edge of the photo he’d left behind.” The narrator shows her pain through action and detail, not direct statement.  How to Practice: Pick an emotion (e.g., jealousy, hope) and write a paragraph without naming it. Use the narrator to describe actions, objects, or settings that imply the feeling. For example, jealousy might be: “Clara watched her sister’s new dress catch the light, her own reflection dim in the window.”  Why: Subtext engages readers by letting them infer meaning, making the story feel richer and more interactive.Technique 2: Play with Narrative Distance
Narrative distance is how “close” the narrator is to the character’s thoughts and feelings. A close narrator feels like they’re inside the character’s head; a distant one feels like an observer.  Example (Close): “Her heart raced as the door creaked open, every shadow a threat.”
Example (Distant): “She stood by the door, her posture tense, as it opened slowly.”  How to Practice: Write a scene twice—once with a close narrator (diving deep into the character’s thoughts) and once with a distant narrator (focusing on external actions). Compare how each version affects the mood.  Why: Distance controls emotional intensity. Close narration creates intimacy; distant narration can build suspense or detachment. Beginners can experiment with distance to find the right balance for their story.Technique 3: Use the Narrator to Break Rules
A bold narrator can break conventions to surprise readers. For example, they might address the reader directly, jump forward in time, or comment on the story itself.  Example: In Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, the narrator occasionally interrupts to say, “So it goes,” after a death, creating a detached, fatalistic tone. This isn’t traditional, but it’s unforgettable.  How to Practice: Try writing a paragraph where the narrator breaks one rule—e.g., they address the reader (“You’d think she’d know better, wouldn’t you?”) or hint at the future (“Little did he know, this was his last sunrise”). See how it changes the story’s energy.  Why: Breaking rules makes your narrator memorable and can reinforce the story’s themes. For beginners, this is a way to experiment without overhauling your entire plot.PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: A SAMPLE SCENELet’s apply everything we’ve covered. Below is a short scene written three ways, each with a different narrator. Notice how the narrator’s choices shape the reader’s experience, even though the events are identical.Scene Setup: A man named Leo is waiting in a café for his estranged daughter, who’s late.  Version 1: Neutral Narrator (Third-Person Limited)
Leo sat at the corner table, stirring his coffee. The clock ticked past 2:00 p.m.

His daughter was late. He checked his phone, then put it down. The café was quiet, except for the hum of the espresso machine.  Analysis: This narrator is invisible, sticking to facts. It’s clear but lacks emotional depth. Readers know what’s happening but don’t feel much.  Version 2: Cynical Narrator (Third-Person Limited)
Leo stirred his coffee for the hundredth time, the spoon clinking like his patience running out. Of course she was late—classic Clara, always keeping him dangling. The café’s cutesy decor mocked him, all pastel mugs and fake flowers. He checked his phone, saw no texts, and tossed it on the table.  Analysis: This narrator has an attitude, coloring Leo’s frustration with sharp, judgmental language. The tone suggests Leo’s bitterness and hints at a strained relationship, making readers curious about Clara.  Version 3: Empathetic Narrator (Third-Person Limited)
Leo’s spoon traced slow circles in his coffee, as if stirring could keep his hopes afloat. The clock read 2:05, each tick a small wound. Clara was late, but maybe she was just nervous—maybe she needed time. The café’s soft light caught the edge of his worn jacket, a reminder of all the years they’d lost. He glanced at his phone, willing it to light up with her name.  Analysis: This narrator is gentle, diving into Leo’s emotions and framing Clara’s lateness as understandable. The details (worn jacket, soft light) evoke sympathy, making readers root for their reconciliation.  Why This Matters: The same scene feels entirely different based on the narrator’s tone, focus, and bias. As a beginner, practicing scenes like this helps you see how much power your narrator has.  Exercise: Take a simple scene from your own writing (e.g., a character eating breakfast, walking to work). Rewrite it three times with different narrators: one neutral, one judgmental, one compassionate. Compare how each version changes the reader’s perception.FINAL TIPS FOR BEGINNING WRITERSAs you develop your narrator, keep these principles in mind:Start Small: Don’t try to create a wildly experimental narrator right away. Focus on consistency—pick one tone and stick to it for a short story or chapter.  
Read Actively: Pick up books known for strong narration (The Great Gatsby, Beloved, American Psycho). Underline passages where the narrator’s voice stands out. Ask, “What’s the narrator doing here, and why?”  
Revise with Intent: After writing a draft, go back and highlight every sentence where the narrator’s voice is clear (e.g., a metaphor, a judgment). If there aren’t many, add some to strengthen the voice.  
Trust Your Choices: Beginners often worry about “getting it wrong.” There’s no wrong narrator, only ineffective ones. If your narrator serves the story and feels consistent, you’re on the right track.  
Practice, Practice, Practice: Narration is a skill. The more you experiment with different voices, tones, and distances, the better you’ll get at wielding your narrator like a pro.

your narrator is not a neutral bystander. They’re the architect of your story’s reality, deciding what the reader sees, feels, and believes. As a beginning writer, embracing this power can feel daunting, but it’s also liberating. Every word you write is a chance to shape the reader’s experience. By understanding your narrator’s role, personality, and agenda, you can turn a flat story into something vivid, emotional, and unforgettable.Take the time to experiment with your narrator’s voice. Ask yourself who they are, what they want, and how they’re guiding the reader. Practice the exercises in this post—rewriting scenes, playing with tone, creating subtext—and you’ll start to see your stories come alive in ways you didn’t expect. The narrator isn’t your friend, but they’re your greatest ally. Use them wisely.
