Every device is a mirror for the speaker.
When someone uses repetition, you’re not just hearing the beat — you’re hearing their urgency. You know they want something badly enough to hammer it into the air until you get it.

An anticlimax? That tells you about their relationship with drama. Are they self-aware enough to undercut tension on purpose, or are they the type to bungle the big moment without realizing it?

A malapropism shows us how they process the world — maybe they’re pretentious but not as smart as they think, maybe they’re endearingly confused, or maybe they grew up mishearing words and never corrected themselves.

A double entendre says something about their worldview — maybe they’re sly, maybe they’re inappropriate, maybe they’re a wordplay junkie who can’t resist showing off.

Word salad? That’s raw personality. It can reveal that a person is flustered, lying, rambling to cover something up, or just so lost in their own head that they’ve stopped making sense to anyone else.

Puns — whether groan-worthy or sharp — instantly give you a read on someone’s playfulness, their comfort with language, and how they connect ideas.

Voice isn’t just “how they talk” — it’s why they talk that way.
When we move into Character & Voice, the question becomes:

Who is using this device?

What do they want in this moment?

How does the way they get it wrong make them more human?

A voice is never just an accent or a vocabulary list — it’s a pattern of thinking. The devices we’ve covered so far are different flavors of that thinking.

A character who keeps using malapropisms might be someone whose ambition outpaces their education.

A character who delivers constant anticlimaxes could be afraid of sincerity, using humor to dodge vulnerability.

A character who leans into repetition might be desperate to be heard in a world that talks over them.

Getting it wrong is the good part.
One of the most important threads tying all this together is wrongness — not in a “mistake = bad” way, but in a “mistake = truth” way.

We don’t remember characters for saying exactly the right thing at exactly the right time. We remember them for fumbling, overdoing it, cutting themselves off, making an absurd leap. That’s the texture of real human speech.

Every device we’ve covered so far can be “perfectly executed” by a professional comedian or speechwriter — but in fiction, perfection is sterile. Imperfection is where the character leaks through.

So in Character & Voice, these devices become tools.
Up until now, we’ve been treating them like little self-contained tricks. Now, they become part of the larger question:

“If I hear this line and nothing else, can I tell exactly who said it and what was driving them?”

When you think of it that way, you stop asking “How do I make this pun land?” and start asking “What does it say about the person who would make this pun right here, right now?”
