What It Is
Desire is the engine of every story. Strip away the clever structure, the sparkling dialogue, even the world itself—and what you’re left with is want. Someone wants something. That’s it. That’s the spark. It can be small or world-ending. It can be as simple as wanting to get out of bed, or as huge as wanting to save the world or win someone’s love. Desire is the pulse behind every character, every decision, every scene, every lie, every moment of truth.

At its core, desire is a need unmet. A lack, a hunger, a hole at the center of a person. Sometimes the character knows exactly what they want. Sometimes they’re lying to themselves. Sometimes the reader sees it before the character does. But until someone wants something, nothing moves.

The Deep Dive: What Makes Desire
Desire isn’t just the “goal” written on a character sheet. It’s physical, emotional, social, spiritual. It’s layered and contradictory. Someone might want safety and excitement at the same time. They might want to be loved but also want to be left alone. Real desire is messy, raw, tangled up in fear and hope.

Every story—every good story—has desire running through its veins. That doesn’t mean everyone’s always chasing something obvious. Some characters hide their desire. Some fight it. Some bury it under denial or bravado or a mountain of self-hate. The tension between what a character wants, what they say they want, and what they actually do is the beating heart of drama.

Desire isn’t static. It shifts, grows, shrinks, flips inside out. What a character wants at the start of a story isn’t always what they need by the end. Sometimes they get what they want and realize it’s empty. Sometimes they fail and grow. Sometimes wanting is all there is.

Why Desire Matters
Without desire, there’s no story—just stuff happening. Desire is what puts pressure on the world, makes characters act, makes scenes matter. It’s the thing that makes the reader care. If you know what a character wants, you know what to fear for them, what to hope for, what to root against. Desire creates stakes.

Everything else in story bends to desire. Conflict is just what happens when desire runs into resistance—another person’s want, a locked door, the weight of the world. Structure is the shape of want—how it’s pursued, abandoned, fulfilled, or denied. Dialogue, subtext, pacing, even the smallest details—these are all shaped by who wants what, and how badly.

Desire is universal. It doesn’t matter if you’re writing about gods or losers, aliens or suburban teens. Every human action, every lie, every mistake, every punchline, every tragedy—underneath it is desire, plain and messy and true.

Why Most Stories Fail Without It
Ever read something and felt nothing? Probably missing desire. Characters drift through scenes, things happen, but you don’t care—because nobody wants anything, or at least you can’t feel it. Without desire, you get plot without stakes, dialogue without tension, action without meaning.

Stories break down when desire is fuzzy, or when it never changes. If a character’s want isn’t clear, or if it doesn’t evolve, the story stalls. The reader tunes out. No one roots for wallpaper.

How Desire Is Often Misunderstood
People confuse desire with plot (“the quest for the ring”), or with personality (“she’s ambitious”). But real desire is deeper. It’s felt, not just stated. Characters might not be honest about what they want—even to themselves. Sometimes the most interesting desire is hidden, or the character is fighting against it. Want isn’t just about the surface; it’s about the itch underneath.

A lot of writing advice boils it down to “what does your character want?” but the better question is, “what are they hungry for, what would they risk, what would they kill or save or break to get it?” And: “what are they terrified to want?”

How Desire Powers Everything
Conflict: All drama is want meeting resistance.

Theme: What people want (and whether they get it) is the story’s moral core.

Plot: Every major turn is shaped by someone’s desire colliding with the world.

Scene: Every scene is a negotiation of want—who gets closer, who loses ground.

Voice: The energy of a story comes from how raw, how true, how alive the desire feels.

The Many Faces of Desire
It’s not always “I want to win.” Desire can be twisted:

Longing for connection but sabotaging it

Craving escape but clinging to routine

Yearning for approval but acting out for attention

Needing safety but diving into danger

Desire is often in conflict with itself. Some of the best stories are about characters torn in half by wanting two things at once.

The Writer’s Job
If you do nothing else—make desire clear. Make it felt. If it’s hidden, show the cracks. If it’s dangerous, show the risk. Track how it changes. If you know what every character wants, even if they lie about it, you’ve got story fuel for days.

Everything else is just style.


You Know What It’s Like to Want Something
Let’s get real for a second: you already understand desire because you’ve lived it. You’re no different than your favorite characters. You’ve been hungry, angry, obsessed, grieving, stubborn, in love, on the edge, desperate for something to change. Maybe you wrote a story for revenge, or to get closure, or just because you couldn’t not write it. That’s desire.

You don’t have to sit there and analyze a character like a specimen in a lab. You find their desire by recognizing your own. Common ground. If you want something—anything—then you know what it’s like to be inside someone else’s skin, wanting, needing, reaching for whatever is out of reach. You’re not “figuring out” your characters from the outside; you’re meeting them where you both live.
Everybody wants something. You do too. That’s the connection. Every story you write, at its core, is about what that character wants this time, and how that turns out for them.

How to Spot Desire in the Wild
1. They SAY What They Want
Sometimes, desire is right on the surface. A character names what they want, plain and clear. This is the easiest to spot because it’s spoken out loud or written down—there’s no hiding, no code, no guessing. They claim it, own it, or maybe blurt it out in a moment of weakness. You don’t have to dig; they hand it to you.

What Does It Look Like?
It could be a grand declaration (“I want to be king!”), a desperate confession (“I just want someone to love me”), or even a flippant aside (“Honestly, I just want a fucking nap”). Sometimes it’s a line in a speech, sometimes it’s a throwaway comment at the bar. Whatever the moment, when someone says what they want, everything that follows is shaped by that admission. The story is about to bend around this hunger, for better or worse.

Why Writers Use It
Making a character say what they want clarifies the stakes for the reader or audience. There’s no ambiguity: you know what to look for, what to worry about, what to hope for or dread. When a character names their desire, you can feel the risk—if they don’t get it, something breaks. You can also feel the world start to push back. People who declare their desires tend to find out just how tough the world (and the plot) can be.

What to Listen For
Direct statements: “I need to find my brother.” / “I’m going to win this competition.”

Vows and promises: “I swear I’ll never let anyone hurt you again.”

Revealed dreams: “Someday I’m gonna make it out of this town.”

Moments of anger or frustration: “All I want is for someone to listen to me for once!”

Moments of vulnerability: “I just want to be happy.”

Why It Matters
When desire is spoken, it’s like a flag planted in the story. The audience can track every action, every obstacle, every betrayal back to this one, clear line in the sand. Even if the character tries to backpedal, you know what’s really at stake. Every victory or loss circles back to what was said, and there’s a special kind of heartbreak or satisfaction when a character gets (or doesn’t get) the thing they asked for.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

The Princess Bride — Inigo Montoya: “Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.”
Says it, means it, lives it. Every action flows from this stated desire for revenge.

Hamilton — Alexander Hamilton: “I am not throwing away my shot!”
He’s hungry, he admits it, and every song and setback is about chasing opportunity.

Finding Nemo — Marlin: “I promised I’d never let anything happen to him!”
Says what he wants—safety for his son. The whole movie is a struggle with this desire.

Legally Blonde — Elle Woods: “I’ll show you how valuable Elle Woods can be!”
Declares her desire to prove herself. Everything unfolds from this moment.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone — Harry: “I just… I just want to know what my parents looked like.”
A softer, vulnerable desire that drives the emotional core of his journey.

The Pursuit of Happyness — Chris Gardner: “I’m the type of person that if you ask me a question and I don’t know the answer, I’m going to tell you that I don’t know. But I bet you what: I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer.”
Lays out his hunger and determination for a better life.

Mad Max: Fury Road — Furiosa: “I’m looking for hope.”
A spoken desire that steers every wild turn of the story.

Ratatouille — Remy: “I want to be a great chef.”
States it early and the whole plot is about the impossible climb to get there.

How It Changes the Story
When desire is out in the open, it gives the audience a lens—a way to measure every action and every setback. You don’t need subtext or hidden meaning; you’re watching someone chase a named need. Even if the story twists and the desire shifts, you’ve got a baseline for what drives them.
It’s also risky: characters who say what they want make themselves vulnerable. They can be mocked, challenged, or blocked. Sometimes they get it, sometimes not. But once it’s said, there’s no going back.

For Writers
Don’t be afraid to let your characters say what they want. It doesn’t make them flat—it makes them real, and it gives your story spine. Sometimes the boldest thing a character can do is admit what’s inside them.

How to Spot Desire in the Wild
2. They SHOW What They Want
Desire isn’t always spoken. Most of the time, it leaks out in action—what a character does when nobody’s watching, or what they can’t help but do even when it’s risky. Sometimes they never say a word about what’s burning inside, but their choices scream it loud.

What Does It Look Like?
You see it in their decisions—the things they chase, the rules they break, the lines they won’t cross, the trouble they invite. It’s the quiet stuff: a look, a pause, the way they always end up standing outside the same window. It’s habits, obsessions, slips, and patterns. Sometimes a character says the opposite of what they want, but their actions always give them away. Desire hides in what a character can’t stop doing, even when it makes no sense.

Why Writers Use It
“Show, don’t tell” is one of the oldest rules because action is honest. People (and characters) often lie with their words but can’t fake what they want with their choices. Showing desire makes the audience work a little—pulling them closer, letting them feel clever for noticing the undercurrent. It creates depth, subtext, and tension, because sometimes even the character doesn’t know what they want until their own actions reveal it.

What to Watch For
Repeated behaviors: Always going back to the same person, place, or habit.

Sacrifice: Giving up something valuable to get closer to what they want.

Risk: Taking chances, breaking rules, or inviting trouble for the sake of their desire.

Persistence: Refusing to give up, even after setbacks or rejection.

Contradiction: Saying one thing, but doing another. (E.g., “I don’t care”—but they keep coming back.)

Why It Matters
Showing desire in action makes it feel true—because real life is like this. Most people don’t announce their longings; they act on them, sometimes in ways they can’t explain. When you write (or spot) desire in action, you turn a character into a living, breathing person. Readers connect on a gut level, even if the words never come.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

Indiana Jones (Raiders of the Lost Ark)
He doesn’t talk much about why he risks his life for relics, but he’s always running, fighting, risking everything to keep history alive. His desire is in the action—never quitting, always diving back in.

Joe March (Little Women)
She insists she doesn’t care about marriage, but keeps pouring herself into her writing, fighting for her independence, and showing her longing for recognition and family.

Don Draper (Mad Men)
He rarely talks about what he wants, but his affairs, constant reinvention, and creative risk-taking show his hunger for meaning, connection, and escape from himself.

Joel (The Last of Us)
He doesn’t say “I need family again,” but everything he does to protect Ellie, the sacrifices, the violence, the soft moments—his desire is written in blood and sweat.

Shrek (Shrek)
He claims he wants to be left alone, but everything he does—going on the quest, saving Fiona, letting Donkey in—shows a craving for friendship and acceptance.

Moana (Moana)
She’s told to stay on the island, but she keeps going to the water, practicing, rebelling, risking everything for something she can’t fully name.

Tony Soprano (The Sopranos)
He says he’s fine, but the therapy visits, his violence, his obsession with family—all show the mess of desire inside him.

Batman/Bruce Wayne (DC Comics, films)
He never admits he’s seeking peace or justice—he just keeps putting on the mask and risking his life to save Gotham, night after night.

WALL-E (WALL-E)
No words for most of the film—he just keeps saving little trinkets, watching old musicals, caring for his plant, following EVE across space. Everything he does points to longing for connection and purpose.

Eleven (Stranger Things)
She rarely says what she wants, but always runs toward her friends, faces down monsters, and risks everything for belonging and love.

How It Changes the Story
When desire is shown, not told, the story gains layers. The audience gets to “read” the character’s actions and fill in the gaps. It creates tension—sometimes the character is at war with themselves, sometimes the audience knows before they do. Watching someone act out their need is often more satisfying than just hearing about it. You get the stakes, the risk, the hunger, with no hand-holding.

For Writers
Let your characters betray themselves with action. Make them break their own rules, go out of their way, give up things, ruin things, cross lines, return to the same hurt over and over. Don’t just have them say “I want”—show what they’ll actually do for it. If you do this, even the most reluctant, silent, or complex character will come alive.



How to Spot Desire in the Wild
3. They HIDE What They Want
Sometimes desire doesn’t show up as a bold speech or a clear pattern of action. Sometimes it’s buried—denied, disguised, or defended against at all costs. This is the hardest to spot and the most human: wanting something so much that you’ll do anything not to admit it, even to yourself.

What Does It Look Like?
Desire hides under jokes, anger, silence, overwork, cruelty, or detachment. Characters might lie, push people away, pretend not to care, sabotage themselves, or mask longing with bravado. Sometimes they want the “wrong” thing (socially, morally, emotionally), so they suppress or destroy any sign of it. Sometimes the audience sees it first—sometimes not even the writer can name it right away.

You’ll find hidden desire in:

What a character doesn’t say or do

What they avoid

The things they mock or attack

Their distractions, addictions, obsessions, and “safe” routines

Emotional outbursts that don’t match the surface situation

The stuff they sacrifice “for no reason,” or the lines they refuse to cross even when it hurts

Why Writers Use It
Hidden desire is the stuff of real drama and complexity. People hide what they want for a million reasons: fear, shame, trauma, self-protection, pride, habit. Hiding creates tension—inside the character, between characters, and for the audience. It also gives readers something to dig for, to sense before it’s revealed, to relate to in a gut-deep way.

This is what gives stories depth and surprise: the moment when the mask cracks, the truth slips out, or the character is forced to face what they’ve been running from. Even if it’s never spoken, the shadow of that hidden want hangs over every scene.

What to Watch For
Denial: “I don’t care.” (But their reactions say otherwise.)

Projection: Attacking or blaming others for the very thing they want or fear.

Avoidance: Dodging people, situations, or questions that get too close to the truth.

Overcompensation: Acting extra tough, cold, or careless to bury vulnerability.

Displacement: Pouring energy into something “safe” (work, a hobby, helping others) to avoid what they really want.

Self-Sabotage: Destroying chances at what they want before they can be disappointed.

Outbursts: Anger or breakdowns when the subject is poked.

Why It Matters
Hidden desire makes characters—and real people—complicated. You get stories where what’s not said is louder than what is. You can feel the tension in every scene, the risk that something will break if the truth comes out. It’s the engine behind so many reversals, betrayals, confessions, breakdowns, and breakthroughs. The audience becomes detectives, reading between the lines.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

Don Draper (Mad Men)
Pretends to be content, successful, and in control. Hides a mess of longing and regret under work, drinking, and affairs. Rarely admits what he wants, even to himself.

Spock (Star Trek)
Trained to suppress emotion, but his loyalty, frustration, and rare bursts of feeling always betray what he truly values and fears.

BoJack Horseman (BoJack Horseman)
Masks pain and longing with sarcasm, self-destruction, and detachment. Wants to be loved and forgiven, but pushes everyone away.

Princess Leia (Star Wars: A New Hope)
Acts only as a leader, never showing fear or loneliness. Her vulnerability and longing for family are only visible in small cracks.

Batman/Bruce Wayne
Hides his need for connection, family, and healing beneath the mask and a life of violence.

Elsa (Frozen)
Tries to suppress her power and desire for freedom out of fear, isolating herself instead of reaching for what she truly wants.

Frodo Baggins (The Lord of the Rings, later books/films)
Claims he’s fine, but becomes haunted by the ring—his longing for peace and normalcy is visible only in brief, aching moments.

Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty)
Hides his loneliness and pain with arrogance, jokes, and reckless behavior.

The Narrator (Fight Club)
Doesn’t realize he’s created Tyler Durden to act out his own buried wants for chaos and self-destruction.

The Bride (Kill Bill)
Conceals her longing for her daughter, focusing only on revenge until the core desire breaks through.

Sam Winchester (Supernatural)
Insists he just wants a normal life, but constantly chooses danger, adventure, and the family “business.”

How It Changes the Story
Hidden desire is the ticking time bomb. The longer it’s buried, the more explosive the reveal. Every scene carries an undercurrent—characters orbit around their own secrets, choices spiral, and when it finally comes out (if it does), everything changes. Sometimes the story is the slow, painful journey to admitting what’s really at stake.

For Writers
Write what’s buried. Let your characters lie, distract, run, fight, and sabotage themselves. Build scenes around what isn’t said. Use silence, avoidance, contradiction. The more a character hides, the more desperate and powerful their desire becomes—and the more satisfying it is when the truth finally breaks the surface (or never does).


Potency Levels: Low — The Quiet Want
What Low Potency Desire Is
Low-potency desire is the soft ache at the edge of awareness. It’s the kind of want that lingers in the background: subtle, easily overlooked, maybe even dismissed by the character themselves. It’s a dream that hasn’t turned into a plan, a need that hasn’t reached crisis. Most of the time, the character wouldn’t even name it as “desire”—it’s just a sense that something is missing, a wish for more, or a feeling that life could be different if only…

In low-potency mode, desire doesn’t drive the plot—it shapes the emotional landscape. It creates a sense of possibility, a layer of tension, or a quiet sadness or hope that flavors the story’s world. It’s not nothing; it’s the seed before the storm, the prelude to action, the inner life of a person not quite ready to change.

How It Shows Up in Characters
Daydreaming or drifting: The character spends time imagining different possibilities—what if they quit their job, told the truth, went somewhere else? These thoughts are private and rarely acted on.

Mild dissatisfaction: They feel restless, bored, or stuck, but not enough to actually do anything about it. They might complain, sigh, or distract themselves.

Envy or longing: They notice what others have—a relationship, freedom, recognition—and wish for it, sometimes without admitting it to anyone.

Gentle nostalgia: Remembering a time when life felt fuller, or a moment when they almost had what they wanted.

Routine avoidance: Finding small ways to escape—getting lost in a book, scrolling endlessly, working late, lingering in conversations that offer comfort or escape.

Small, private acts: Maybe they save clippings, keep a secret sketchbook, reread old letters—little rituals that feed the want without ever risking anything real.

Story Effects of Low-Potency Desire
Sets a Mood: This level of desire can make a story feel atmospheric, introspective, or quietly tense. The reader senses something unresolved, even if the character seems “fine.”

Builds Empathy: Because it’s relatable. Everybody knows what it’s like to want something but not chase it—either out of fear, habit, or a sense that it’s out of reach.

Foreshadows Change: Low desire is often the first domino. It hints at what could grow later—if the right spark or pressure arrives.

Deepens Character: Characters with quiet wants feel real. They aren’t just reacting to external events; they have an inner life. Their longing, even if faint, makes their world richer.

What It Feels Like to Write
You’re not rushing: Scenes breathe. There’s space for little moments, for atmosphere, for interiority.

Dialogue is indirect: Characters might not name what they want—they hint, avoid, or talk around it.

Conflict is gentle: The struggle is mostly internal—should I say something, should I act, should I let it go?

Pacing is slower: The story isn’t in a hurry. The tension is all about possibility, not crisis.

Pop Culture Examples
Jim Halpert (The Office):
Jim quietly wants more from his life—and Pam—but he rarely makes a move. Most of his desire is in the way he looks at the camera, his small jokes, or the way he lingers at Pam’s desk. His longing flavors every episode, but doesn’t force action until much later.

Amélie (Amélie):
Amélie is full of soft wishes—connection, love, making others happy. At first, these desires live in small acts of kindness, private fantasies, and gentle sabotage. Her want is dreamy, never demanding.

Chihiro (Spirited Away, early film):
Lost, homesick, too scared to act. Her longing for home and courage is present, but she spends much of the beginning in passive observation.

The Narrator (Lost in Translation):
Both main characters want something more—intimacy, meaning, change—but can barely put it into words. It’s all in the glances, silences, and what isn’t said.

Marge Gunderson (Fargo, at home):
She’s content, but there’s a subtle wish for quiet, stability, and connection that’s only visible in how she cares for her husband.

The Little Prince (The Little Prince):
Wandering, asking questions, missing his rose. His want is simple, pure, almost invisible unless you’re paying attention.

When to Use Low Potency as a Writer
When you want to set up a character’s journey before the real risks start.

When you’re writing slice-of-life, coming-of-age, or meditative stories where atmosphere matters as much as plot.

When your story is about noticing, not doing; about what could happen, not what must.

When you want the reader to feel the ache of ordinary life—unspoken dreams, missed chances, little yearnings.

What Keeps Desire Low?
Fear: The cost of wanting feels too high.

Habit: The character is used to disappointment or to playing it safe.

Uncertainty: They don’t know what they want, or doubt it’s possible.

Obligation: They feel responsible for others and put their wants last.

Complacency: Maybe life is “good enough”—or so they tell themselves.

How Low Desire Can Change
A spark—someone new, a crisis, a sudden opportunity—can flip low desire to medium or high.

Sometimes it stays low, and the story becomes about acceptance, loss, or the beauty of longing itself.

Sometimes, just naming the want out loud is the act of courage that starts everything moving.

Low desire is the hum under the noise.
Write it with patience, honesty, and respect for the ordinary ache everyone knows.
Let it breathe.
It’s where almost every story begins.

Potency Levels: Medium — The Active Want
What Medium Potency Desire Is
Medium-potency desire is the tipping point where want turns into action. The character knows what they want (or is close to admitting it), and the story starts to move because of it. This is where longing becomes real choice—where the dream gets tested, risks appear, and something in the world has to give. Medium is all about momentum: not a raging obsession, but definitely more than a passive wish.
It’s the moment where the ache inside finally pushes out into the open.

How It Shows Up in Characters
Taking Steps: The character starts making decisions, however small, that move them toward what they want. This might mean applying for a new job, sending a risky text, standing up for themselves, or secretly planning a way out.

Facing Obstacles: As soon as they act, the world pushes back. Now there are real stakes—conflict with other people, internal guilt, fear of failure.

Owning the Want: Maybe for the first time, they admit (to themselves or someone else) that they want what they want. There’s pride, fear, hope, or all three.

Tension in Dialogue: Medium desire is often spoken out loud, or shown in subtext—there’s negotiation, confrontation, or a plea.

Mixed Motivation: Characters may still hedge their bets. They want it, but are afraid to want it too much. They might test boundaries or try and fail before they go all in.

Story Effects of Medium-Potency Desire
Creates Forward Motion: The story starts happening because of what the character wants, not just to them. Their desire is now a plot engine.

Reveals Character: You learn who they are by what they’re willing to risk or try. This is where strengths and weaknesses show up.

Draws Out Conflict: Medium-level want guarantees resistance—there’s something in the way, and now it matters.

Raises Stakes: The audience starts caring more, because there’s something to root for or against. Tension builds.

Drives Relationships: Characters start colliding—alliances, rivalries, love, betrayal all heat up when desire is out in the open but not yet overwhelming.

What It Feels Like to Write
Scenes Heat Up: There’s more direct confrontation, action, and movement. Less floating, more friction.

Dialogue Has an Edge: People ask for what they want, bargain, argue, or admit things they were hiding.

Events Link Together: Because characters make choices, scenes feel connected—one want leads to another, one action creates new consequences.

Emotions Are Higher: There’s hope, fear, excitement, anxiety, sometimes humor or surprise.

Conflict is Real: Obstacles matter now, and failure is possible.

When to Use Medium Potency as a Writer
When you want your story to move—not just reflect or observe.

When you want character-driven plot: real people, making real choices, dealing with real fallout.

When your story thrives on conflict, negotiation, risk, or growth.

When you want your characters to be relatable but also inspiring—they want things, they act, but they’re still human.

What Keeps Desire at Medium?
Doubt: They want it, but aren’t sure they’ll succeed, or aren’t sure they’re worthy.

External Pressure: Family, friends, society—someone is in the way, but not enough to stop them.

Fear of Consequences: They act, but with hesitation. Risks are real, but not fatal (yet).

Testing the Water: The character might fail, fall back, or even retreat temporarily before going all-in.

Divided Loyalties: They want more than one thing, or their want clashes with another person’s.

How Medium Desire Can Change
Success or failure raises the stakes—if things go well, desire can ramp up to high. If they get burned, they might dial back, or find a new want.

Conflict forces clarity: Sometimes the character has to choose between wants, or between want and safety.

Crisis or betrayal can push them into high potency (all-in), or drive them back to low (giving up, repressing).



Potency Levels: High — The Consuming Need
What High Potency Desire Is
High-potency desire is want cranked all the way up—an obsession, a hunger, a need so intense it can’t be ignored or managed. The character knows what they want and will risk everything to get it. It burns through fear, shame, or reason. High desire changes the rules: it drives plot, warps relationships, and forces the world to respond. If medium is the engine, high is the explosion.

At this level, desire is not just a feature of the character—it’s the main force of the story. The stakes are life, death, love, destruction, transformation. There’s no safe path, no going back. Something is going to break.

How It Shows Up in Characters
Obsession: The want takes over. The character can’t focus on anything else, even to their own detriment.

Sacrifice: They’re willing to lose everything—safety, reputation, love, even their soul—to get it.

Self-destruction: The character might sabotage themselves, spiral, or bring ruin to others just for a chance at their goal.

Defiance: All rules, laws, morals, or expectations fall away if they get in the way of this want.

Single-minded action: Every choice, every conversation, every risk is bent toward the thing they want.

Blinding intensity: The character might not care who gets hurt, what gets destroyed, or even if they survive, as long as they get there.

No Plan B: Even if they lose, they won’t let go. There’s nothing else for them.

Story Effects of High-Potency Desire
Everything Escalates: Plot accelerates. Every scene is hotter, more dangerous, less predictable.

Climax Magnet: High desire pulls the story toward the breaking point—showdowns, betrayals, confessions, deaths, revolutions.

Morality Gets Messy: Good people do bad things; villains reveal their wounds; everyone’s real face comes out.

Collateral Damage: The consequences aren’t just personal—other characters, whole worlds, or systems can be shattered by the pursuit.

No Safety Net: The story can’t walk anything back—whatever happens, it will have lasting, maybe permanent, consequences.

What It Feels Like to Write
Everything is urgent: Scenes crackle, there’s no “filler,” no downtime.

Dialogue is raw: Confessions, threats, pleas, breakdowns, ultimatums—nobody’s hiding anymore.

Characters burn bridges: Allies turn into enemies, enemies into lovers, the ground is always shifting.

The story is unstable: Anything can happen. Anyone can fall.

Pop Culture Examples
Walter White (Breaking Bad):
He stops caring about anything but his power and legacy. He’ll destroy his marriage, risk his family, kill or be killed, all for the want that owns him.

When to Use High Potency as a Writer
For stories about obsession, tragedy, revenge, epic love, world-changing events.

When you want to test what a character (and your world) can survive.

When you’re ready to break something open—hearts, rules, entire worlds.

For climaxes, finales, or stories about transformation and consequence.

What Pushes Desire to High?
Loss: A dream, person, or status slips away, and the character snaps.

Betrayal: Someone they trusted stands in the way.

No more hiding: The character is forced to admit what they want, and nothing else matters.

Point of no return: A choice or event makes retreat impossible.

Desperation or hope: Sometimes hope burns as hot as despair—either way, there’s no letting go.

How High Desire Can Change
If they succeed, it may feel empty, cost too much, or transform them.

If they fail, it might destroy them—or, rarely, lead to acceptance and peace.

Sometimes the only ending is a total break: loss, exile, death, or rebirth.

High desire is dangerous.
Use it when you want to see what breaks, what survives, and what is revealed when the masks are off.
Everything gets sharper. Every scene is fire.

Tools for Actively Controlling Potency Levels
1. Escalation and De-escalation
Raise the potency:
Throw in a catalyst—a new obstacle, a threat, a ticking clock, a betrayal, an unexpected opportunity. Force your character to choose in a way that costs them.
Example: Pam gets engaged to someone else (The Office), Jim’s low desire turns medium and then high.

Lower the potency:
Give the character an “out,” or let them settle. Sometimes, the world makes the want seem smaller (distraction, disappointment, comfort, or realization).
Example: After a big loss, a character might retreat, deny, or decide “maybe it’s not worth it.”

2. Change the Stakes
Make the consequences of wanting bigger or smaller.
Example: Wanting coffee (low stakes) vs. wanting to save someone’s life (high stakes).
If what’s on the line grows, so does desire’s intensity.

3. Play With Resistance
Increase resistance:
Make it harder for the character to get what they want (external conflict, internal doubt, opposition). Resistance turns a glimmer into a blaze.

Remove resistance:
Make it easy, and the desire might soften, even fade. No challenge = no heat.

4. Expose or Conceal the Want
Make it public:
When the character admits their want to others, it often jumps to a higher level (more risk, more commitment, more fallout).

Keep it secret:
As long as desire is private, it often simmers at low or medium—unless circumstances force it out.

5. Mix Internal and External Pressures
Sometimes, what raises potency is the collision of inner need and outside circumstance.
Example: A character is fine with low-level longing until someone else wants the same thing—or threatens to take it away.

6. Let Desire Shift Over Time
Desire is dynamic:
It should shift. Early scenes can be low, with glances and hints; as things change, it rises, peaking when the risk is greatest.

Show setbacks:
Failed attempts can actually increase potency—now the character wants it more.

7. Use Symbolic Objects/Actions
Sometimes objects or rituals in a story “measure” potency.
Example: Letters never sent (low), letters mailed (medium), a public speech (high).
Small actions = small want. Big gestures = big want.

8. Physical and Emotional Signals
Low potency: silence, drifting, indirect language, small gestures.

Medium: risk, confession, direct action, visible stress.

High: obsession, meltdown, burning bridges, open defiance.

9. Other Characters Can Push the Dial
Allies can stoke the fire (“Go for it!”), rivals can block, mentors can warn, family can guilt, etc. Don’t keep the desire in a vacuum—let others raise or lower the stakes.

Questions to Ask Yourself as You Write
What does my character want right now, and how badly?

What would it take to push them to act? To hold back?

What stands in the way, and how much does that matter to them?

If they don’t get what they want, what does it cost them—today, tomorrow, forever?

If they do get it, does it satisfy them, or just create a new want?

“Dial” Examples
Low → Medium:
Character passively watches their crush from afar → their crush is about to move away, so they make a move.

Medium → High:
Character wants a promotion → rival cheats and wins, so the character risks it all to expose them.

High → Low:
Character will do anything for revenge → realizes the cost, lets go, finds peace (or collapses).

Potency is dynamic. You can turn it up or down scene by scene, moment by moment, with what you throw at your character and how you show their reaction. If you ever feel stuck, just ask: “How badly do they want it right now—and what would raise or lower the heat?”
