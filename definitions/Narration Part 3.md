Narration Part 3: Unreliable Narrators Aren’t Just Liars
Let’s get something straight: an unreliable narrator isn’t someone who lies. A liar knows they’re lying. An unreliable narrator might be telling you the absolute truth as they see it—and still be completely full of shit.

Unreliability isn’t a twist. It’s not a “gotcha” at the end. It’s not about shocking the reader with a reveal that the narrator was wrong all along. That’s cheap. It makes the narrator a trick and the reader a mark. Good unreliable narration is a structure, not a trap. It lets you dig into contradiction, memory, denial, ego, survival. It’s the most honest form of dishonesty in fiction.

If you’ve ever tried to write about something that really happened and found yourself dodging parts of it, shading the truth, reordering events, or just plain forgetting—then you already understand how unreliability works. You’ve done it. We all have. You’ve been your own unreliable narrator.

So this isn’t foreign territory. This is about turning that reflex into a choice.

Who Lies, Who Forgets, Who Doesn’t Know?
Most writing advice splits unreliable narrators into categories like:

Liars (intentionally deceive the reader)

Naïfs (don’t understand the world fully)

Madmen (distorted perception due to trauma, delusion, drugs)

But those are just surface types. What you need to ask is:

Who is this narrator unreliable for?
Are they hiding something from the reader?
From the other characters?
From themselves?

The best unreliable narrators aren’t unreliable in every sentence. They’re inconsistent in strategic ways.

Let’s break down the modes, but from a functional point of view—not a trope list.

1. The Self-Protective Narrator
(aka: I couldn’t have known. I didn’t know.)

This narrator isn’t trying to manipulate the reader. They’re trying to survive the memory.

They minimize. They reframe. They don’t tell you what happened in the bathroom, or why they left without saying goodbye. They give you polished versions. They give you tone over detail.

This kind of unreliability is protective, not deceptive. It often sounds measured, calm, literary even.

But underneath it, something is rotting.

Writers who’ve lived through shit know this mode instinctively. You don’t spill the full story. You circle it. You give a clean version first, one that won’t make you flinch. You test the water.

If you write a character like this, you’re building a narrative that doesn’t break down the door right away. It walks around the house. The reader feels the absences even when the sentences are clean. They learn to read the gaps.

How to Use It:
Let the reader sense what’s missing before they know what it is.

Give a confession that avoids the heart of the matter.

Show moments where the narrator almost admits something—and pulls back.

2. The Biased Narrator
(aka: It wasn’t my fault.)

This one’s a little more aggressive. They’re not protecting themselves from trauma. They’re protecting their ego.

This narrator builds a case. They justify, deflect, explain. The ex was crazy. The friend was ungrateful. The system was rigged. They’re not exactly lying—they’re just building a very specific version of events where they come out clean.

This is the narrator who wants the reader on their side. They might even be charming. They might be funny. They might hand you a version of the story that feels really satisfying. Until you realize they left out the parts that matter.

You’ve met people like this. You’ve probably been this person, depending on the audience. This is the narrator who tells the same breakup story three different ways depending on who’s listening.

How to Use It:
Let the reader notice inconsistencies in how the narrator treats different characters.

Drop small clues that the narrator is more involved than they let on.

Let other characters contradict the narrator without direct confrontation.

3. The Delusional Narrator
(aka: Everything is fine.)

This is the one who doesn’t just omit truth or spin it—they see it wrong. Fully. Unshakably.

It’s not that they’re dumb. It’s that their whole emotional reality is warped. They live inside a version of events where what’s happening makes sense—to them. And that version is usually more palatable than the real one.

Think of trauma survivors who normalize horror. Think of people in abusive systems who cling to rationalizations because the alternative—facing the full truth—would destroy them. These narrators don’t flinch because they can’t afford to.

This is what it feels like to write a character who trusts the wrong people, who blames themselves for things that weren’t their fault, who sees love where there is only control.

It’s not a twist. It’s a tragedy.

How to Use It:
Let the reader feel discomfort the narrator doesn’t.

Use contradictions between tone and content (“It was a good day,” after describing something horrific).

Let the narrator take responsibility for things that clearly weren’t their fault—and mean it.

4. The Manipulative Narrator
(aka: Let me tell you a story...)

This narrator knows they’re lying. They just don’t care.

They’re in control of the story. They want something. Maybe they want your sympathy. Maybe they want to sell you something. Maybe they just want to keep you entertained until it’s too late.

This kind of narrator is fun to write if you’re willing to fully commit to the bit. They aren’t just narrating the story. They’re curating the experience. They know exactly what effect they want to have.

These are the showmen. The con artists. The murderers. The lovers. The survivors who want you to listen, but not interrupt. They are storytellers in the most literal, theatrical, intentional sense.

They’re not always evil. But they are never neutral.

How to Use It:
Make them charismatic—until they go too far.

Let them brag about their manipulation.

Let the reader enjoy the ride—then feel complicit in what they missed.

Building Reader Awareness Without Breaking the Story
The trick with unreliable narration is letting the reader feel it before you explain it. The reader should notice the seams. They should feel slightly ahead, slightly uncertain. But they shouldn’t feel cheated.

The worst thing you can do is write 300 pages of falsehood and then pull a rabbit out of your ass in the final chapter.

Instead, layer the doubt.

Here’s how:

Give them moments where the narrator contradicts themselves without realizing it.

Let side characters drop hints that the narrator brushes off.

Use tone to betray content. (Cheerful narration about something that should be devastating.)

Let small, subtle facts poke holes in the narrator’s version.

Unreliability isn’t a punchline. It’s a slow leak. The reader should feel the floorboards shift under them, one creak at a time.

Writing From Experience: The Slippery Version of Truth
If you’ve ever tried to explain your own story to someone who wasn’t there—someone who doubted you, or believed you too easily—you know how it feels to shape the narration. Not lie. Just…choose.

What to emphasize.
What to skip.
What to make sound reasonable.
What to disguise as a joke.
What to test, then walk back.
What to say flat-out because you’re too tired to soften it anymore.

That’s what writing an unreliable narrator is. It’s not a genre choice. It’s not a twist mechanic. It’s an emotional stance. It’s a way of narrating from inside a character who is protecting, distorting, justifying, or reliving their truth.

When you write from that place, you don’t have to force anything. The unreliability just comes out—because the narrator’s voice will betray what they’re not ready to say.

 don’t “plan” the unreliability.  let the character talk. Then  go back and look at what they said like a detective. What did they leave out? What do they keep repeating? Where did the temperature drop? That’s where the damage is.

Unreliability Is a Feature, Not a Bug
Readers actually love unreliable narrators. Not because they like being lied to—but because it makes them feel active. It turns reading into an investigation. It gives them a role.

You’re letting them read between the lines, not just along them.

This kind of narration builds tension without needing plot twists. It creates layered rereads. It builds a relationship between the reader and the voice—one that’s full of risk and doubt and intimacy.

Used well, it’s one of the most powerful tools in narrative fiction.

Quick Writing Challenge
Try this:

Write a scene in first-person where the character confesses something painful. Keep the tone reserved, even a little proud.

Rewrite the same scene, but insert just one sentence that completely undermines their version—then let them move on without explaining it.

Last pass: Write the same scene from another character’s perspective, reacting to that same confession, and quietly suggesting the real truth.

Look at what changes—not just in content, but in power.

As a beginning writer, you might think unreliable narrators are advanced territory—something for seasoned authors pulling off clever twists. But that’s not true. Unreliable narration is a natural extension of how humans tell stories. You’ve already done it in real life: when you’ve told a friend a story but left out the embarrassing parts, or when you’ve justified a mistake to make yourself feel better. Unreliable narration is just taking that instinct and making it deliberate in your writing.An unreliable narrator isn’t about tricking the reader. It’s about showing a character’s truth—flawed, biased, or broken as it may be—and letting the reader piece together the gaps. This makes your story feel alive, layered, and human. For beginners, mastering unreliable narration is a way to add depth to even simple stories, turning a flat narrative into something readers can’t stop thinking about.Why It Matters: Unreliable narrators create emotional engagement by making readers active participants. They have to question, interpret, and investigate, which makes the story stick. For example, in The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, Holden Caulfield’s cynical, contradictory narration makes readers question his judgments, creating a complex portrait of a troubled teen.Actionable Tip: Before writing an unreliable narrator, ask yourself, “What’s the one truth my narrator can’t face?” This will guide their unreliability and keep it consistent.HOW TO CRAFT AN UNRELIABLE NARRATORCreating an unreliable narrator is like building a character with a hidden wound. You need to know why they’re unreliable, how it shows up, and how to clue readers in without breaking the story. Here’s a step-by-step process for beginners.Step 1: Define the Narrator’s Blind Spot
Every unreliable narrator has a blind spot—a truth they can’t or won’t see. This could be trauma, ego, delusion, or ignorance. Decide what your narrator is hiding (from themselves, the reader, or others) and why.Example: In Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, Amy’s diary entries seem honest but hide her manipulative nature. Her blind spot is her belief that she’s justified, which makes her narration compellingly skewed.Why: The blind spot is the heart of unreliability. It gives the narrator a reason to distort the truth, making their unreliability feel organic, not forced.Step 2: Choose the Type of Unreliability
Your narrator’s unreliability should align with your story’s goal. Revisit the modes you outlined (self-protective, biased, delusional, manipulative) and pick one that fits.  Self-Protective: They avoid painful truths to cope. Example: In The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro, Stevens represses his emotions, narrating his life with detached professionalism to avoid facing regret.  
Biased: They justify their actions to look good. Example: In Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov, Humbert Humbert paints himself as a romantic hero to mask his predatory behavior.  
Delusional: They believe a warped version of reality. Example: In Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk, the narrator’s fractured mind hides the truth about Tyler Durden.  
Manipulative: They deliberately mislead for effect. Example: In The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie, the narrator omits key details to keep readers guessing.

Why: The type of unreliability shapes how readers perceive the narrator and the story. Beginners should choose one mode to keep the narration focused.Step 3: Plant Clues Strategically
Unreliable narration works when readers sense something’s off without feeling cheated. Drop subtle hints through:  Contradictions: The narrator says one thing but describes something that doesn’t add up.  
Side Characters: Others react in ways that challenge the narrator’s version.  
Tone vs. Content: The narrator’s cheerful tone clashes with grim events.  
Small Details: Objects or actions hint at a truth the narrator ignores.

Example: In We Were Liars by E. Lockhart, Cadence’s fragmented memories and vague descriptions hint at a tragedy she’s suppressing. The clues are there, but they’re subtle enough to keep readers guessing.Why: Clues build trust with the reader. They feel smart for noticing discrepancies, which makes the story rewarding.Step 4: Test the Narrator’s Voice
Write a short scene (200–300 words) with your unreliable narrator. Then, reread it and ask:  Does the narrator’s voice feel consistent with their blind spot?  
Are there enough clues for readers to sense unreliability?  
Does the narration avoid feeling like a cheap trick?

If the voice feels flat or the unreliability feels forced, adjust the tone or add more subtle hints.Why: Testing ensures the narrator’s unreliability feels natural and serves the story. Beginners often overdo it (making the narrator too obviously “crazy”) or underdo it (making the story feel flat).Actionable Tip: Create a “narrator profile” before writing. Answer:  What truth are they avoiding, and why?  
How does their unreliability show up (omissions, justifications, delusions)?  
What clues will hint at the truth?

This profile keeps your narrator consistent and purposeful.DEEP DIVE: TACTICAL USES OF UNRELIABLE NARRATORSLet’s explore how to use each type of unreliable narrator strategically, with examples and tips for beginners.Self-Protective Narrator: Hiding Pain
This narrator avoids emotional truth to survive. They might describe events calmly but skirt around key details.  Example: In Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro, Kathy narrates her dystopian life with quiet acceptance, avoiding the full horror of her reality. Her restraint makes the story’s tragedy hit harder.ascend: Tactic: Use understated language and focus on mundane details to contrast with the suppressed truth. “I tidied the room after he left, folding the blanket neatly.”  
Why: The contrast between calm narration and hidden pain creates a haunting effect.

Exercise: Write a paragraph where the narrator describes a painful event (e.g., a breakup) but focuses on irrelevant details (e.g., the weather, the furniture). Add one detail that hints at their hurt (e.g., “I polished the table until it gleamed, ignoring the ache in my chest”).  Biased Narrator: Defending Ego
This narrator spins events to protect their self-image, blaming others or rationalizing mistakes.  Example: In American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis, Patrick Bateman describes his violent acts with casual detachment, framing himself as a sophisticated observer rather than a monster.  Tactic: Let the narrator justify their actions with convincing logic, but include details that undermine them. “I yelled because she deserved it, though her tears caught me off guard.”  
Why: This creates tension as readers see through the narrator’s self-deception.

Exercise: Write a scene where the narrator blames someone else for a failure (e.g., “The deal fell through because he sabotaged it”). Add a subtle clue (e.g., “My notes were somewhere, probably lost in the clutter”) that suggests their own fault.  Delusional Narrator: Warped Reality
This narrator genuinely believes a false version of events, often due to trauma or mental state.  Example: In Shutter Island by Dennis Lehane, Teddy Daniels’ narration reflects his denial of a traumatic truth, making readers question his reality.  Tactic: Use a confident tone to describe events that don’t add up. “The room was warm and safe, despite the locked door.”  
Why: The disconnect between tone and reality creates unease, pulling readers into the narrator’s distorted world.

Exercise: Write a paragraph where the narrator describes a “perfect” day, but include details that suggest something’s wrong (e.g., “The party was lively, even if the guests kept whispering”).  Manipulative Narrator: Curating the Story
This narrator deliberately misleads for effect, often charming or persuasive.  Example: In The Talented Mr. Ripley by Patricia Highsmith, Tom Ripley narrates his schemes with calculated charm, making readers almost root for him until his actions go too far.  Tactic: Make the narrator likable but include moments where their control slips. “I told her I was trustworthy, though my hands shook slightly.”  
Why: This creates a thrilling, morally complex experience as readers question their own allegiance.

Exercise: Write a scene where the narrator convinces the reader of their innocence, but one detail (e.g., “I smiled warmly, my knife still in my pocket”) reveals their intent.  COMMON PITFALLS AND HOW TO AVOID THEMBeginners often struggle with unreliable narrators because they overcomplicate or underdeliver. Here’s how to avoid common mistakes.Pitfall 1: Making It Too Obvious
The narrator’s unreliability is so blatant (e.g., “I’m lying right now!”) that it feels gimmicky.  Fix: Keep the unreliability subtle. Instead of saying, “I didn’t do it,” say, “I wasn’t even there,” with a detail like “my coat still damp from the rain” to hint otherwise.  Why: Subtlety respects the reader’s intelligence, making the reveal satisfying.Pitfall 2: No Clues for the Reader
The narrator’s unreliability is revealed only at the end, making readers feel cheated.  Fix: Scatter small discrepancies throughout. If the narrator claims, “I’m always honest,” show them avoiding eye contact or repeating themselves nervously.  Why: Early clues make the unreliability a journey, not a shock.Pitfall 3: Inconsistent Unreliability
The narrator is unreliable in some scenes but not others, without a clear reason.  Fix: Tie unreliability to the narrator’s motivation (e.g., they’re protective when discussing family but honest about work). Use your narrator profile to stay consistent.  Why: Consistency makes the narrator feel like a real person, not a plot device.Pitfall 4: Overusing Unreliability
Every sentence is a lie, making the story exhausting or unbelievable.  Fix: Let the narrator be reliable in some areas (e.g., describing settings) but unreliable in others (e.g., their motives). This balance keeps readers grounded.  Why: Selective unreliability creates depth without overwhelming the reader.ADVANCED TECHNIQUES FOR BEGINNERSOnce you’re comfortable with unreliable narration, try these techniques to add nuance:  Technique 1: Use Subtext for Unreliability
Let the narrator’s unreliability show through what they don’t say. Example: Instead of “I didn’t cry,” write, “I stared at the wall, counting the cracks.”  How to Practice: Write a scene where the narrator avoids mentioning a key event (e.g., a fight). Focus on irrelevant details to hint at their avoidance.  Why: Subtext makes unreliability feel organic and invites readers to dig deeper.Technique 2: Contrast Narrator and Action
Let the narrator’s words clash with their actions. Example: “I was calm,” as they slam a door.  How to Practice: Write a paragraph where the narrator claims one emotion (e.g., “I was happy”) but their actions suggest another (e.g., “I crushed the paper in my fist”).  Why: This creates tension and makes readers question the narrator’s truth.Technique 3: Use Unreliable Narration for Theme
Tie the narrator’s unreliability to the story’s core idea (e.g., denial, identity, morality). Example: In Atonement by Ian McEwan, Briony’s unreliable memory reflects the theme of guilt and perception.  How to Practice: Identify your story’s theme (e.g., “truth is subjective”). Write a scene where the narrator’s unreliability reinforces that theme.  Why: This makes the narration integral to the story’s meaning, not just a trick.SAMPLE SCENE: UNRELIABLE NARRATION IN ACTIONHere’s a scene written three ways to show how unreliable narration changes the effect.  Scene Setup: A character, Sam, describes a failed job interview.  Self-Protective Narrator:
The interview went fine, really. The office was stuffy, the chairs stiff. I answered their questions clearly, shook hands firmly. No big deal. My tie was still knotted tightly when I got home.  Effect: Sam’s calm tone avoids the failure, but the “tightly knotted tie” suggests lingering tension. Readers sense his denial.  Biased Narrator:
The interview was a setup. The manager barely listened, scribbling notes like I was a nuisance. I gave perfect answers, but they’d already picked someone else. My tie was flawless, unlike their process.  Effect: Sam blames the interviewers, but the “scribbling notes” hint suggests he might’ve misread their disinterest. Readers question his ego.  Delusional Narrator:
The interview was a triumph. The manager smiled, nodded, loved my ideas. I’m sure they’ll call tomorrow. I hung my tie carefully, ready for the next meeting.  Effect: Sam’s optimism feels off, and the “carefully hung tie” implies a ritual to cling to false hope. Readers feel unease.  Why This Matters: Each version shows how unreliability shapes the reader’s perception. Beginners can practice this to see how small choices create big effects.FINAL TIPS FOR BEGINNING WRITERSStart with Motivation: Always know why your narrator is unreliable. Write a one-sentence explanation (e.g., “They’re hiding guilt to protect their self-image”).  
Read Actively: Study unreliable narrators in books like The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins or Notes on a Scandal by Zoë Heller. Highlight where their unreliability shows up and how.  
Revise with Care: After writing, check for clues that hint at unreliability. If there aren’t enough, add subtle contradictions or details.  
Balance Truth and Lies: Let your narrator be reliable in some areas to keep readers grounded. Total unreliability can feel chaotic.  
Practice Subtlety: Experiment with small, quiet moments of unreliability (e.g., a narrator focusing on the weather during a crisis) to build skill.

Unreliable narrators aren’t just liars—they’re complex, human voices that reveal truth through their flaws. As a beginner, you can use them to create stories that feel alive, layered, and emotionally gripping. By understanding your narrator’s blind spots, planting subtle clues, and aligning their unreliability with your story’s goal, you turn reading into an investigation—one that keeps readers hooked and thinking long after the last page.Practice the exercises in this post. Study how unreliable narrators work in your favorite books. Experiment with different modes of unreliability. Most importantly, don’t treat unreliability as a gimmick.
