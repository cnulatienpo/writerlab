The Positive Arc (How to Write Transformational Growth)

Positive arcs aren’t about “good” characters—they’re about broken ones.

The kind who start out clinging to a lie, who resist change until the story forces them to choose: evolve or collapse.

Think:

Frodo (Lord of the Rings) – "I wish none of this had happened." → "I choose to carry the Ring."

Eleanor (The Good Place) – "I’m a trash person." → "I can be better."

Shrek (Shrek) – "Better alone than rejected." → "Love is worth the risk."

But here’s what most guides miss: A positive arc isn’t a straight line upward. It’s a spiral—a cycle of resistance, relapse, and hard-won progress.

Let’s break it down.

1. The 5 Beats of a Compelling Positive Arc
Beat 1: The Lie They Believe
A false worldview rooted in fear ("Vulnerability is weakness," "I’m unworthy of love").

Example: Woody (Toy Story) believes his worth depends on being Andy’s favorite.

Beat 2: The Wound That Fuels It
A past trauma that justifies the lie.

Example: Moana’s father forbids sailing after his friend died at sea.

Beat 3: The Reluctant Journey
They pursue an external goal (often selfish) while avoiding internal growth.

Example: Han Solo joins the Rebellion for money, not ideals.

Beat 4: The Mirror Moment
They see their lie clearly—and almost turn back.

Example: In Paddington 2, Paddington considers stealing the book to clear his name.

Beat 5: The Earned Change
They act differently—proving their growth.

Example: In Ratatouille, Ego abandons his cynicism after tasting the dish.

2. Why Positive Arcs Feel Earned (Not Preachy)
The magic isn’t in the ending—it’s in the resistance.

A. Let Them Fail First
A character who changes too easily feels cheap.

Example: Zuko (ATLA) betrays Iroh after seeming to reform.

B. Make the Lie Seductive
Their old mindset shouldn’t feel stupid—it should feel safe.

Example: In Crazy Rich Asians, Rachel could’ve walked away from Nick’s family. That’s why her choice to stay matters.

C. The Price of Growth
They must lose something to gain their new truth.

Example: In Frozen, Elsa’s freedom requires abandoning the palace.

3. Writing a Positive Arc That Doesn’t Feel Cheesy
A. Avoid “Suddenly Good” Syndrome
Growth isn’t a light switch—it’s a series of micro-choices.

Tool: Map 3 small moments where they almost relapse.

B. Tie Growth to Action
Don’t just tell us they changed—show them doing the thing they’d never do earlier.

Example: In The Shawshank Redemption, Andy’s final act of hope is mailing the evidence.

C. Let Secondary Characters Call BS
Have someone name their lie before they’re ready to hear it.

Example: In Tangled, Flynn calls out Rapunzel’s fear of leaving the tower.

4. Your Turn: The Growth Draft
Exercise 1: The Lie They Tell Themselves
Write your character’s internal monologue at the start vs. the end. How does their self-talk shift?

Exercise 2: The Relapse Scene
Write a moment where they almost revert to old habits—and what stops them.

Closing Thought: Positive Arcs Are the Stories We Need
We don’t write them because they’re easy.

We write them because they’re true—to the stubborn, glorious mess of human change.

1. The Five Beats of a Compelling Positive Arc (Expanded)The five beats of a positive arc form a roadmap for transformation. They’re not rigid rules but flexible milestones that guide a character from their starting point—a flawed, limited perspective—to a place of growth. Let’s break them down with deeper analysis, additional examples, and tips for implementation.Beat 1: The Lie They BelieveEvery positive arc begins with a lie—a flawed belief that shapes the character’s worldview. This lie isn’t just a misunderstanding; it’s a deeply ingrained conviction, often rooted in fear, insecurity, or a need for self-preservation. The lie feels true to the character, offering a sense of safety or control in a chaotic world.Why It Matters: The lie is the foundation of the arc. It’s the lens through which the character interprets their reality, and it’s what makes their eventual growth meaningful. A weak or vague lie leads to a weak arc, so it’s crucial to make it specific and personal.
Expanded Insight: The lie should resonate with universal human struggles but be tailored to the character’s unique circumstances. For example, a generic lie like “I’m not good enough” becomes more compelling when tied to a specific context, such as “I’m not good enough to lead this team because I failed my last project.” This specificity grounds the lie in the character’s reality, making their journey relatable yet distinct.
Examples Across Media:Literature: In Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth Bennet believes that first impressions are reliable and that Darcy’s arrogance defines him. Her lie is rooted in her pride and quick judgment.
Film: In The Matrix, Neo’s lie is that he’s an ordinary nobody, incapable of being “The One.” This belief stems from a lifetime of feeling insignificant in a controlled system.
TV: In Breaking Bad (a complex arc with positive elements), Jesse Pinkman initially believes he’s just a small-time criminal who can’t aspire to anything greater.

Implementation Tip: To craft a strong lie, ask: What does my character fear most about themselves or their world? How does this fear manifest as a belief they cling to? Write a single sentence that encapsulates their lie, and ensure it’s something they’d defend passionately at the story’s start.

Beat 2: The Wound That Fuels ItThe lie doesn’t exist in a vacuum—it’s fueled by a wound, a past trauma or experience that justifies the character’s belief. This wound gives the lie emotional weight, making it harder for the character to let go.Why It Matters: The wound humanizes the character. It shows why they cling to their lie, even when it’s self-destructive. Without a wound, the lie feels arbitrary, and the character’s resistance to change seems unmotivated.
Expanded Insight: The wound doesn’t have to be a single, dramatic event. It can be a series of smaller hurts, a cultural or societal pressure, or even an absence (e.g., lack of love or validation). The key is that the wound feels real to the character, even if it’s not objectively catastrophic. For example, a character might believe “I can’t trust anyone” because they were betrayed once, or because they grew up in an environment where trust was punished.
Examples Across Media:Literature: In The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield’s lie (“The world is full of phonies”) stems from the wound of his brother Allie’s death and his alienation from a society he perceives as inauthentic.
Film: In Inside Out, Joy’s lie (“Sadness has no purpose”) is fueled by her fear of losing Riley’s happiness, tied to her role as the “leader” of Riley’s emotions.
Video Games: In The Last of Us, Joel’s lie (“I don’t need anyone”) is rooted in the wound of losing his daughter Sarah, which makes him wary of forming new attachments.

Implementation Tip: Write a short flashback or memory that reveals the wound. It doesn’t need to be explicit in the story, but you, the writer, should know it intimately. Ask: What moment or pattern in their past made this lie feel like the only way to survive?

Beat 3: The Reluctant JourneyIn this beat, the character pursues an external goal—often tied to their lie—while resisting internal growth. They’re thrust into the story’s conflict, but their focus is on achieving something tangible (e.g., a prize, revenge, survival) rather than confronting their flaws.Why It Matters: This beat establishes the character’s starting point and sets up the tension between their external and internal journeys. Their reluctance to change makes their eventual growth feel earned.
Expanded Insight: The external goal should align with the lie but also challenge it indirectly. For example, a character who believes “I’m only valuable if I win” might pursue a competition, but the story’s challenges force them to question what “winning” truly means. This beat is also where secondary characters or external forces (e.g., a mentor, a villain, or a crisis) begin to nudge the character toward growth, even if they resist.
Examples Across Media:Literature: In The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins pursues the external goal of helping the dwarves reclaim their treasure, driven by his lie that he’s content with a quiet, unadventurous life.
Film: In Legally Blonde, Elle Woods enrolls in Harvard Law to win back her ex-boyfriend, clinging to the lie that her worth depends on his validation.
TV: In The Queen’s Gambit, Beth Harmon pursues chess mastery to prove her worth, avoiding the emotional work of confronting her trauma and addiction.

Implementation Tip: Define the character’s external goal in one sentence, then identify how it reinforces their lie. Next, list three story events that force them to question this goal, even subtly. For example, a character seeking fame might encounter a mentor who values authenticity over recognition.

Beat 4: The Mirror MomentThe mirror moment is the turning point where the character confronts their lie head-on. They see their flaws clearly, often through a moment of crisis or self-reflection, and must decide whether to change or double down on their old ways.Why It Matters: This is the emotional core of the arc. It’s where the character’s internal conflict peaks, and their choice sets the stage for the story’s resolution. A weak mirror moment feels like a plot contrivance; a strong one feels like a gut punch.
Expanded Insight: The mirror moment doesn’t always involve a literal mirror (though it can, as in Mulan when she sees her reflection). It’s any moment where the character is forced to face their true self. This could be a confrontation with another character, a failure that exposes their flaws, or a quiet moment of realization. The key is that it’s personal and undeniable—they can’t hide from the truth anymore.
Examples Across Media:Literature: In To Kill a Mockingbird, Scout’s mirror moment comes when she stands on Boo Radley’s porch, seeing her town and herself from his perspective, realizing the depth of her own biases.
Film: In Fight Club, the narrator’s mirror moment is realizing that Tyler Durden is a projection of his own psyche, forcing him to confront his self-destructive lie.
TV: In Fleabag, Fleabag’s mirror moment in Season 2 occurs during her confessional monologue to the Priest, where she admits her fear of being truly seen.

Implementation Tip: Write the mirror moment as a single scene, focusing on the character’s internal dialogue or a key interaction. Ask: What truth are they forced to face? How does this moment make them feel vulnerable? Ensure the stakes are high—retreating to the lie should feel tempting, but costly.

Beat 5: The Earned ChangeIn the final beat, the character acts on their new truth, proving their growth through a concrete action. This isn’t just a change in attitude—it’s a demonstration of transformation that contrasts with their earlier behavior.Why It Matters: The earned change is what makes the arc satisfying. It shows the character has internalized their growth and is willing to act on it, even at a cost. Without this beat, the arc feels incomplete or unconvincing.
Expanded Insight: The action should be specific and tied to the story’s stakes. It’s not enough for the character to say they’ve changed—they must do something that would have been unthinkable at the story’s start. This action often involves sacrifice, courage, or vulnerability, and it should resolve both the internal and external conflicts (at least partially).
Examples Across Media:Literature: In A Christmas Carol, Scrooge’s earned change is giving Bob Cratchit a raise and becoming a second father to Tiny Tim, actions that contrast his earlier greed.
Film: In The Incredibles, Bob Parr’s earned change is trusting his family to fight alongside him, abandoning his lie that he must be a solo hero.
Video Games: In Red Dead Redemption 2, Arthur Morgan’s earned change (in a high-honor playthrough) is sacrificing himself for John Marston, rejecting his lie that he’s beyond redemption.

Implementation Tip: Identify one action your character would never take at the story’s start. Then, craft a climactic scene where they take this action, tying it to their new truth. Ask: How does this action reflect their growth? What does it cost them?

2. Why Positive Arcs Feel Earned (Not Preachy)Positive arcs resonate when they feel authentic, not like a sermon. The original post highlighted three key principles: letting characters fail, making the lie seductive, and ensuring growth comes at a price. Let’s dive deeper into each, adding new layers and examples to show how to execute them effectively.A. Let Them Fail FirstCharacters who change too quickly feel like plot devices, not people. Real growth is messy, marked by setbacks and moments of doubt. By letting your character fail—reverting to their lie under pressure—you create tension and make their eventual triumph more impactful.Expanded Insight: Failure doesn’t always mean a dramatic betrayal or collapse. It can be subtle, like a character slipping back into old habits during a moment of stress. These failures should escalate the stakes, showing what’s at risk if the character doesn’t change. For example, a character who lies to avoid conflict might lose a key relationship due to their dishonesty, pushing them closer to their mirror moment.
Examples Across Media:Literature: In The Great Gatsby (a tragic arc with positive elements), Gatsby briefly tries to reconnect honestly with Daisy but fails when he clings to his idealized vision of her.
Film: In Whiplash, Andrew’s obsession with perfection leads him to alienate his girlfriend and family, a failure that forces him to question his priorities.
TV: In BoJack Horseman, BoJack’s repeated relapses into self-destructive behavior (e.g., sabotaging his relationships) highlight the difficulty of his growth.

Advanced Technique: Create a “failure ladder.” Map three moments where the character fails to act on their potential growth, with each failure increasing the consequences. For example:Failure 1: They lie to avoid a small conflict, causing a misunderstanding.
Failure 2: They lie again in a high-stakes situation, losing an ally’s trust.
Failure 3: Their lie leads to a major setback, forcing them to confront the cost of their behavior.

B. Make the Lie SeductiveThe lie shouldn’t feel foolish—it should feel like a lifeline. A seductive lie is one that offers comfort, control, or identity, even if it’s flawed. This makes the character’s resistance to change relatable and their eventual shift more meaningful.Expanded Insight: A seductive lie often ties to the character’s strengths as well as their flaws. For example, a character who believes “I must always be in control” might be a brilliant leader, but their lie prevents them from trusting others. The lie should also align with the story’s world—cultural or societal norms can reinforce it, making it harder to break free.
Examples Across Media:Literature: In 1984, Winston’s lie (“I can resist the Party’s control”) is seductive because it gives him a sense of agency in a totalitarian world, even though it’s futile.
Film: In Black Panther, T’Challa’s lie (“Wakanda must stay isolated”) is seductive because it protects his nation’s safety and tradition.
TV: In Succession, Kendall Roy’s lie (“I can escape my father’s shadow”) is seductive because it fuels his ambition, even as it traps him in a cycle of self-destruction.

Advanced Technique: Write a scene where the character defends their lie to another character, articulating why it feels essential. Then, have the other character poke holes in their logic, planting seeds of doubt. This dialogue can foreshadow the mirror moment.

C. The Price of GrowthGrowth isn’t free—it demands sacrifice. Whether it’s a relationship, a dream, or a piece of their identity, the character must lose something to embrace their new truth. This cost makes the arc feel real and prevents it from feeling like a fairy-tale resolution.Expanded Insight: The price should be tied to the lie and the wound. For example, a character who believes “I must be perfect” might need to sacrifice their reputation to admit a mistake. The price can also be emotional—letting go of a long-held grudge or accepting a painful truth. The key is that the loss feels significant to the character, even if it’s not catastrophic to the audience.
Examples Across Media:Literature: In Jane Eyre, Jane sacrifices her chance at a comfortable life with Rochester to uphold her moral integrity, choosing self-respect over love.
Film: In Coco, Miguel sacrifices his dream of becoming a musician like Ernesto to honor his family’s legacy, only to find a way to reconcile both.
Video Games: In Mass Effect 3, Shepard’s growth (in a paragon arc) often involves sacrificing personal relationships or ideals to unite the galaxy.

Advanced Technique: Create a “cost-benefit analysis” for the character’s growth. List what they gain by embracing their new truth and what they lose. Ensure the loss is specific and tied to their lie. For example, a character who believes “I can’t trust anyone” might gain a new ally but lose their sense of self-reliance.

3. Writing a Positive Arc That Doesn’t Feel CheesyPositive arcs can easily veer into cliché territory—characters who suddenly become “good” or stories that feel like they’re preaching. The original post offered three strategies to avoid this: avoiding “suddenly good” syndrome, tying growth to action, and letting secondary characters call out the lie. Let’s expand these with deeper insights and new techniques.A. Avoid “Suddenly Good” SyndromeGrowth that happens too quickly feels unearned and artificial. Real change is gradual, marked by small, incremental choices that build toward the final transformation.Expanded Insight: To avoid “suddenly good” syndrome, think of growth as a series of micro-decisions, each one pushing the character closer to their new truth. These decisions should be tested by external pressures—temptations to revert, conflicts that challenge their resolve, or moments of doubt. The character’s arc should feel like a tug-of-war between their old and new selves.
Examples Across Media:Literature: In Les Misérables, Jean Valjean’s transformation from thief to altruist is marked by small choices—helping the poor, sparing Javert—each one building on the last.
Film: In Groundhog Day, Phil Connors’ shift from selfishness to selflessness happens through countless small acts of kindness across his time loop.
TV: In Schitt’s Creek, Alexis Rose’s growth from spoiled socialite to empathetic professional is shown through micro-choices, like taking her job seriously or supporting her family.

Advanced Technique: Create a “growth timeline.” Divide the story into five key moments where the character makes a choice that reflects their evolving perspective. For each moment, note:The choice they make.
The external pressure or temptation they face.
How this choice moves them closer to their new truth.
Example: A character who believes “I must always win” might choose to let a rival take credit in one scene, share resources in another, and finally sacrifice a victory for a greater good.

B. Tie Growth to ActionWords alone don’t prove change—actions do. The character’s growth should culminate in a tangible act that demonstrates their new truth, ideally in a way that resolves the story’s central conflict.Expanded Insight: The action should be specific, measurable, and tied to the story’s stakes. It’s not enough for the character to say “I’ve changed”—they must do something that proves it. This action should also contrast with their earlier behavior, highlighting the distance they’ve traveled. For example, a character who starts the story avoiding responsibility might end it by taking on a leadership role in a crisis.
Examples Across Media:Literature: In The Kite Runner, Amir’s growth is shown when he risks his life to rescue Sohrab, atoning for his earlier betrayal of Hassan.
Film: In Star Wars: A New Hope, Luke’s growth from farm boy to hero is cemented when he trusts the Force to fire the shot that destroys the Death Star.
TV: In Parks and Recreation, Leslie Knope’s growth is shown when she prioritizes her friends’ needs over her political ambitions in later seasons.

Advanced Technique: Write a “before and after” scene comparison. In the “before” scene, show the character acting according to their lie in a specific situation. In the “after” scene, show them facing a similar situation but acting according to their new truth. The contrast will highlight their growth.

C. Let Secondary Characters Call BSSecondary characters can serve as mirrors, calling out the protagonist’s lie before they’re ready to hear it. This creates conflict and plants seeds for the mirror moment, making the arc feel organic.Expanded Insight: The secondary character doesn’t need to be a mentor—they can be a friend, rival, or even an antagonist. The key is that their perspective challenges the protagonist’s lie in a way that feels personal. This confrontation should also reveal something about the secondary character’s own arc or worldview, adding depth to the story.
Examples Across Media:Literature: In Great Expectations, Joe Gargery calls out Pip’s lie (“I’m above my humble roots”) by showing unconditional love despite Pip’s snobbery.
Film: In The Dark Knight, the Joker calls out Batman’s lie (“I can save Gotham without breaking my rules”), pushing him to confront his moral limits.
TV: In Mad Men, Peggy Olson calls out Don Draper’s lie (“I can control my past”) by challenging his secrecy and self-destructive behavior.

Advanced Technique: Create a “truth-teller scene.” Write a dialogue where a secondary character confronts the protagonist about their lie. Ensure the confrontation is specific (tied to an action or event) and emotionally charged. Ask: How does the protagonist react? Do they deflect, argue, or shut down? This reaction can foreshadow their mirror moment.

4. Advanced Techniques for Crafting Positive ArcsTo take your positive arcs to the next level, consider these advanced techniques, which build on the original framework and address common challenges in character development.A. Layer Multiple LiesComplex characters often cling to more than one lie, each tied to a different aspect of their identity. For example, a character might believe “I’m not worthy of love” in their personal life and “I must always be in control” in their professional life. These lies can intersect, creating richer conflicts and more nuanced growth.How to Implement: Identify two or three lies your character believes, each tied to a different wound or context. Map how these lies influence their decisions throughout the story. In the mirror moment, they might confront one lie fully but only partially address the others, setting up potential for further growth in a sequel or series.
Example: In Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Miles Morales believes “I’m not ready to be a hero” (personal lie) and “I can’t live up to Peter Parker’s legacy” (external lie). His arc involves confronting both, but the personal lie takes precedence, allowing room for further growth.

B. Use Subtext in DialogueCharacters rarely state their lie outright—it’s often buried in subtext. Use dialogue to reveal the lie indirectly, through what the character avoids saying or how they deflect challenges.How to Implement: Write a scene where the character discusses their goals or fears with another character. Instead of having them state their lie directly, let it emerge through their word choice, tone, or contradictions. For example, a character who says “I don’t need anyone’s help” might be hiding their fear of vulnerability.
Example: In The Godfather, Michael Corleone’s lie (“I’m not like my family”) is revealed through his insistence on staying “legitimate,” even as his actions pull him deeper into the mafia.

C. Create a Shadow ArcA “shadow arc” is a subtle, parallel arc that runs alongside the main positive arc. This could be a secondary character’s growth, a thematic exploration, or even the protagonist’s struggle with a lingering aspect of their lie. The shadow arc adds depth and prevents the main arc from feeling too tidy.How to Implement: Identify a secondary character or theme that mirrors or contrasts the protagonist’s arc. For example, if the protagonist is learning to trust others, a secondary character might be learning to stand alone. Weave this shadow arc into key scenes, ensuring it complements the main arc without overshadowing it.
Example: In The Lord of the Rings, Frodo’s positive arc (learning to carry the Ring’s burden) is mirrored by Sam’s shadow arc (learning to support without controlling). Their arcs intertwine, enriching the story.

D. Balance Internal and External StakesA positive arc is most compelling when the character’s internal growth is tied to external consequences. Ensure the story’s plot (external stakes) and the character’s arc (internal stakes) are interwoven, so that the character’s transformation has a direct impact on the outcome.How to Implement: Map the story’s external conflict (e.g., defeating a villain, saving a loved one) and identify how the character’s lie hinders their success. Then, design the climax so that their earned change is the key to resolving the external conflict.
Example: In Kung Fu Panda, Po’s lie (“I’m not the Dragon Warrior”) hinders his ability to defeat Tai Lung. His earned change—accepting his unique strengths—enables him to win the final battle.

5. Your Turn: Expanded Exercises for Crafting Positive ArcsThe original post included two exercises to help writers apply these concepts. Below, I’ve expanded these and added new ones to provide a comprehensive toolkit for developing your character’s arc.Exercise 1: The Lie They Tell Themselves (Expanded)Original Task: Write your character’s internal monologue at the start vs. the end. How does their self-talk shift?
Expanded Task:Write a 200-word internal monologue from the character’s perspective at the story’s start, articulating their lie and how it shapes their view of themselves and the world.
Write a second 200-word monologue at the story’s end, showing how their self-talk has evolved to reflect their new truth.
Write a third 100-word monologue at the mirror moment, capturing the moment of doubt and realization as they confront their lie.

Example: For a character who believes “I must always be perfect,” their starting monologue might focus on their fear of failure, the mirror moment might show them questioning this need, and the final monologue might celebrate their acceptance of imperfection.

Why It Works: This exercise helps you internalize the character’s voice and track their emotional journey, ensuring their growth feels consistent.

Exercise 2: The Relapse Scene (Expanded)Original Task: Write a moment where they almost revert to old habits—and what stops them.
Expanded Task:Write a 300-word scene where the character faces a temptation to revert to their lie. Describe the external trigger (e.g., a stressful event, a confrontation) and their internal reasoning for wanting to fall back.
Identify what stops them—another character, a memory, or a realization—and show how this moment pushes them closer to their mirror moment.
Write a follow-up scene (200 words) where they reflect on this near-relapse, showing a small step toward their new truth.

Example: A character who believes “I can’t trust anyone” might be tempted to betray an ally during a crisis. A memory of a past betrayal might stop them, prompting a small act of trust later.

Why It Works: This exercise builds the arc’s tension by showing the character’s struggle and progress in real-time.

Exercise 3: The Wound’s OriginTask:Write a 300-word flashback or memory that reveals the wound behind the character’s lie. Focus on sensory details and emotional impact, not just plot.
Write a 100-word scene where this wound influences a current decision, showing how the lie manifests in their behavior.

Example: For a character who believes “I’m only valuable if I’m needed,” the flashback might show a childhood moment of being ignored unless they helped others. The current scene might show them overextending themselves to feel valued.

Why It Works: This exercise grounds the lie in the character’s history, making their resistance to change feel authentic.

Exercise 4: The Mirror Moment DialogueTask:Write a 400-word scene where a secondary character confronts the protagonist about their lie, leading to the mirror moment. Use dialogue and subtext to reveal the protagonist’s resistance and dawning awareness.
Include a brief internal reflection (100 words) from the protagonist’s perspective, showing their reaction to this confrontation.

Example: A mentor might call out a character’s lie (“You think you’re protecting people by pushing them away, but you’re just scared”). The character might deflect but later reflect on the truth in private.

Why It Works: This exercise strengthens the mirror moment by making it a dynamic, character-driven confrontation.

6. Closing Thought: Why Positive Arcs MatterPositive arcs aren’t just storytelling devices—they’re reflections of the human experience. We’re drawn to stories of growth because they mirror our own struggles to change, to overcome our fears, and to become better versions of ourselves. Writing a positive arc isn’t about crafting a perfect hero or a tidy resolution. It’s about capturing the stubborn, messy, glorious reality of transformation.As writers, we have the power to show that change is possible, even when it’s hard. By grounding our characters’ arcs in authentic lies, wounds, and choices, we create stories that don’t just entertain—they inspire. So, as you craft your next positive arc, remember: it’s not about making your character “good.” It’s about making them human.
