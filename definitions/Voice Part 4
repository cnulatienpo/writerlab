 Your World Might Be Hiding From You
Here’s the thing nobody tells you:
Most writers don’t recognize their own flavor.

You think you’re being “versatile,” or “neutral,” or “professional.”
You think the fact that all your protagonists listen to the same music you do, or eat toast with butter and sugar like your grandma made, or get unreasonably furious when someone calls them “buddy,” is just coincidence.

It’s not.
It’s your world trying to show itself.

You’ve been carrying it your whole life, so it feels invisible to you. It’s like asking a fish to notice water.

So let’s name it.

This is a system for dragging your world out of hiding and letting it take over on purpose.
Because once you can see it, you can shape it. You can amplify it. You can own it.

👁 Step One: Inventory Your Autofill
Your autofill is the stuff you reach for without thinking.

Start by answering these:

What kind of rooms do you always picture?

What kind of clothes do your characters wear, even when you don’t describe them?

What’s on the walls? What does it smell like?

What do your characters eat when they’re sad?

How do they flirt?

What words show up in your dialogue over and over?

What’s your go-to insult?

What’s your default weather?

These are your settings, your textures, your defaults. You don’t choose them—they just show up. That’s your taste sneaking through.

You might think, “But everyone writes apartments and diners and headaches.” No they don’t.
Someone else writes castles and tea and migraines. Someone else writes forests and campfires and nosebleeds. Someone else writes tech offices, ginger tea, and VR sex.

This is what I mean: your autofill is already unique. You just keep treating it like it’s generic.

🧠 Step Two: Find Your Loop
This is about obsession, the gravitational force that keeps dragging you back to certain ideas or dynamics.

Look through everything you’ve written—even the old, shitty stuff.

Write down:

Every kind of scene you’ve repeated at least 3 times.

Every character type you keep writing.

Every kind of ending you lean toward.

Any motif or metaphor you keep using without realizing.

It might be:

Parent/child tension

Time skipping

Food rituals

Long drives at night

The moment after a party ends

People who talk too much to hide something

Characters who sabotage good things “for a reason”

That’s your loop. It might not be sexy or bold or even conscious—but it’s yours.

The trick is not to kill the loop. Don’t sand it off. Cultivate it. Make it deeper. Use it as a portal instead of a rut.

✝ Step Three: Map Your Belief System
This one’s tricky because you probably don’t write sermons. You’re not walking around thinking, “In this scene, I will explore the existential futility of man under capitalism.” (Unless you are. In which case, good luck at your next dinner party.)

But belief shows up in what your stories punish and what they reward.

Try this:

In your stories, who wins?

Who suffers?

What causes pain?

What earns redemption?

What kinds of characters get killed off?

What kinds of endings feel “true” to you?

That’s your belief system. You didn’t invent it. You absorbed it—through your life, your culture, your pain, your parents, your ghosts.

Some people believe sacrifice is noble. Some think it’s pathetic.
Some think truth matters above all else. Others think survival is more important.
Some believe love conquers. Some believe it corrodes. Some believe it’s a scam.

You don’t have to agree with your belief system. You just have to know it’s in there.
Once you spot it, you can either challenge it or lean into it—but now you’re driving.

🗣 Step Four: Track the Rants
Go look at your characters’ monologues.
Look at their outbursts. Their jokes. Their pet peeves.

You’ll find you’re ranting through them.

It might be something small, like:

“Why do people pretend they like kale?”

“If one more dude explains how vinyl sounds better…”

Or something bigger:

“No one cares what happens to poor people.”

“Forgiveness is for people who don’t have to live with the consequences.”

That’s you. Even when it’s not you. Even when it’s coming out of a fictional mouth.

You’re leaking your worldview into the text like a broken faucet.

Don’t fix the leak. Point it at something.

This is where you find your character voice. You’re not just inventing people—you’re giving them pieces of your own brain to chew on.

Your characters don’t need to be copies of you. But let them inherit your tension. Your curiosity. Your inner noise.

🔍 Step Five: Read Your Work Like a Stranger
Now that you’ve gathered all this, do the uncomfortable thing.

Print out a few pages. Sit in a different chair. Hell, change the font.

Read it as if it’s someone else’s work. Then ask:

What kind of person wrote this?

What are they obsessed with?

What do they hate?

What do they wish they could say but can’t quite say directly?

Where do they feel most alive?

You’re not trying to critique your craft. You’re trying to see the writer behind the curtain.

Is it someone stuck between rage and restraint?
Someone trying to prove they’re smart?
Someone lonely but pretending they’re above it?
Someone who wants to be forgiven, but won’t say for what?

That’s not analysis. That’s reconnaissance.

Because guess what? That’s who’s been writing your stories the whole time.
