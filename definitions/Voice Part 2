Part 1: The World You Bring With You
There’s this thing that happens when you’ve been writing long enough. You start trying to “get it right.” Structure, arcs, POV, tone, pacing, polish, beta readers, workshops, query letters. You take the messy joy of having something to say and wrap it up in clean little packages, until half the time, you’re not even writing your story anymore. You’re just trying to make something that won’t get laughed out of a subreddit.

But there’s a different kind of writing that cuts through all that. It’s the kind that makes you lean forward and go, “Who the fuck wrote this?” Not because it’s fancy or perfect or virtuosic. Because it’s so specific, so weirdly them, that you feel like you’re reading something alive.

That’s indulgent writing. The good kind.

Not bloated. Not lazy. I’m not talking about self-important rambling or that style of prose where the writer thinks a paragraph about a teacup is deep just because they wrote it on a rainy day. I’m talking about indulgence as flavor. As texture. As claiming the right to write your world and not sanitize it.

The world you write from isn’t just the setting or genre. It’s your internal ecosystem. The stuff that you know, love, hate, crave, obsess over. The stuff that leaks into your scenes whether you mean to let it or not.

Some writers try to wring that out. They want to be “good.” They want to be neutral. Balanced. Accessible. They want to write something that pleases everyone and offends no one. That’s a fast road to beige prose and dead air.

The ones that stick with you are the ones who never left their world at the door.

Let me show you what I mean.

Hunter S. Thompson never pretended to be normal.
He brought the drugs, the paranoia, the roaring voice of a man who looked at America and decided it was already lost. His writing doesn’t feel clean. It feels like it was ripped out of a motel room wall, with stains still on it. You don’t need to like it. You just know it could only have come from him.

The same goes for Tarantino. The foot thing? Everyone jokes about it, but that’s not the only indulgence. He’s not afraid of artifice. His world is built out of movies—layered with music cues, trunk shots, stylized blood, snappy dialogue, women with exposed toes and bad attitudes. He writes in a genre blender, not because it’s clever, but because that’s his fucking taste. You can roll your eyes, but you can’t deny it’s his.

Scorsese? He builds cinematic cathedrals with stained-glass violence. The guilt of Catholicism, the codes of Italian-American family life, the soundtrack of street noise and Rolling Stones—every piece of his world is embedded in his work. His characters sin big and fall hard, because he believes in that. There’s a moral universe underneath all the drugs and guns and gold watches. You don’t have to be Catholic to feel it. You just have to watch Goodfellas.

Kevin Smith’s indulgence? Dialogue. Dick jokes. Star Wars. Slackers. Everyone’s always standing around, talking, referencing pop culture, and saying shit like it matters. It shouldn’t work. But he made a career out of it, because it was his world, and he let it all in. He didn’t try to write characters who sounded like they were written by Sorkin or Mamet. He let them sound like him and his friends on a curb in Jersey, yelling about lightsaber logistics.

Spike Lee? Nobody does righteous ranting like he does. People don’t just talk in his films—they unload. They monologue. They confront. They break the fourth wall. You can feel the heat of the sidewalk in a Spike Lee movie, the texture of the street, the weight of racism, of history, of Brooklyn in summer. He never sanded down the edges. That’s why his voice is unforgettable.

The people who make work that lasts don’t aim for bland universality. They bring their world with them. Whether that world is loud, angry, obsessive, tender, horny, nostalgic, or weirdly fixated on 70s TV—you can feel it on every page.

The irony is that the more specific a world is, the more real it feels. It might not be your world, but it’s so alive, you believe it.

That’s the power of indulgence. Not self-indulgence in the bad way—where you refuse to edit or think critically. Indulgence as in: you know what you like, and you put it on the page without apology.

You don’t need permission. You need reclamation.

If your characters all end up talking like you and your best friend at 2am when you’re high and talking about death? Good. Write that.
If your stories all take place in one kind of city, with one kind of vibe, because that’s the only thing that feels real to you? Good. That’s your soil.
If you keep writing the same character archetype again and again because you’re still trying to figure them out? Good. That’s your ghost.

Your world doesn’t have to be big. It doesn’t have to be exotic. It just has to be yours.

And let me say this, because nobody does enough: You get to write selfishly.
Not only selfishly, sure. Craft matters. Audience matters. But if you strip all your preferences out just to sound like someone else, what the hell are we reading you for?

You know the difference between a writer who’s writing from their world and a writer who’s writing for approval. One hits like a lightning bolt. The other just flickers.

So I’m not going to tell you to “have fun.” That’s a weak frame. I’m going to tell you to own your indulgence. Claim it. Name it. Build from it. That’s what every great writer you’ve ever admired has done. They just stopped pretending it was shameful.

Next time we’ll talk about the types of indulgence that show up: taste, obsession, belief, and what you can’t shut up about. But for now? Just sit with the idea that maybe, just maybe, the most you thing about your work is the thing worth expanding.

Let it leak.
