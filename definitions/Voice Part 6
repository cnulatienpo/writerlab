Indulgence Without Shame
Let’s talk about the stuff you don’t want to admit is yours.

The foot fetish.
The ex you keep rewriting under different names.
The speech you gave your high school bully—twelve years too late.
The way every love interest kind of looks like the same person.
The scene where someone gets humiliated in just the way that made you cry once.
The fantasy that makes you roll your eyes at yourself even as you keep writing it.

This is the good shit.
The embarrassing stuff.
The stuff you hide behind phrases like “I was just playing around” or “It’s not me, it’s just the character.”

Let’s stop pretending.

Indulgence is strongest when it hits something raw. But most people flinch before they get there. They pull back. They sand off the edges. They joke it away. They “elevate it” into something safe, something respectable.

That’s the moment you lose the fire.

So this post is about keeping the fire—even when it makes you cringe.
Even when it makes you feel like a 14-year-old writing vampire erotica in the back of math class.

Here’s how to go all in without losing control.

Rule 1: Don’t Clean It Up Too Soon
Say you’ve written a scene that turns you on. Or makes you cry. Or taps into something petty, ugly, horny, tender, whatever.

Your first instinct will be to sand it down.

Maybe you’ll bury it in irony.
Maybe you’ll rush past it so it doesn’t linger.
Maybe you’ll replace it with something “deeper,” “smarter,” “more thematic.”

Congratulations. You’ve just murdered the reason you started the scene in the first place.

Don’t do that.

Let the scene be what it is for at least one full draft.
Let the indulgence breathe. Let the embarrassing part stretch out and get comfortable.

You can always rein it in later. But if you clean it up before it ever lived, you’ll never know what it could’ve become.

Rule 2: Separate Embarrassment From Weakness
Embarrassment doesn’t mean bad.
It means exposed.

There’s a difference between writing something clumsy and writing something revealing.

That speech your character gives about never being the favorite child? Maybe it’s melodramatic. Maybe it needs a polish.
But maybe it also feels real in a way that nothing else in your draft does.

That sex scene that makes you cringe? Maybe it’s not actually cringey. Maybe you’re just not used to writing without armor.

That weird running joke about ketchup on everything? Maybe it’s not just a joke. Maybe it’s a memory, or a trigger, or a part of your own texture.

When something makes you feel exposed, ask:
“Am I embarrassed because it’s weak—or because it’s mine?”

If the answer is “because it’s mine,” keep it.

That’s the flavor.

Rule 3: Don’t Hide Behind Cool
This is a pandemic-level problem in modern writing.

Everyone wants to be clever.
Witty. Detached. Polished. Ironic.

Nobody wants to look like they care too much.

But caring is the root of indulgence.
You don’t obsess over things you’re indifferent about.
You don’t keep writing the same loss, the same yearning, the same revenge fantasy, unless it’s lodged somewhere deep in your teeth.

Cool writing is safe. But it’s also boring.
You can’t fake blood.

So if you’ve got something in your writing that makes you feel a little stupid, a little messy, a little over-the-top?
Double down.

Make it more.

If it’s a rant, make it longer.
If it’s a moment, make it louder.
If it’s a desire, don’t clean it up—let it rot on the page.

Write like the person who doesn’t get invited to the cool writers’ table.
Write like someone who needs to get it out or they’ll choke on it.

That’s indulgence without shame.

Rule 4: Give It to Someone Else
Here’s a trick. If you can’t say it as you, say it as them.

Make a character say the thing you’re not allowed to say.
Give them your irrational opinions. Your vindictive thoughts. Your aching need.

Let them want what you’re too polite to admit you want.
Let them lose control in the way you fantasize about.
Let them get all the way there—no brakes, no filter.

You’ll know when you’ve done it right.
You’ll feel a little sick after.
A little worried someone will recognize you in the work.

Good. That means it worked.

Now go back and polish the prose. Fix the pacing. But don’t touch the core.

That’s the part that matters.

Rule 5: Protect It—Then Use It
Some indulgences are just for you. You write them to feel alive. To see something on the page that reminds you you’re not a machine.

You don’t have to share every piece of it.
You don’t have to publish every scene you write.
You don’t have to build a story around every embarrassing thought you’ve ever had.

But you can.

You can take the version that’s too raw and hide it inside a version that looks safe—until someone bites into it and realizes it’s bleeding underneath.



Because when you know how to use your shame—not avoid it—you can write scenes nobody else would dare.
You can write truths that cut past genre, past trope, past cleverness.

And when a reader hits that moment, they don’t think “Wow, this is embarrassing.”
They think, “I didn’t know you were allowed to say that.”

That’s the moment they trust you.

Last Thought: Let Them See You Bleed a Little
You want to write unforgettable stories?
Then stop aiming for control.

Start aiming for contact.

Indulgence—real indulgence—isn’t just about putting your favorite candy or your childhood street into a story.

It’s about letting your fear, your want, your shame leak through in ways you can’t explain.

It’s about letting the reader see you, just for a second, before the scene moves on.

And if it makes you cringe a little?

Good.

That means it was yours.
