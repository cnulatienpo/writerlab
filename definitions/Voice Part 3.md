The Four Horsemen of Indulgence
When we say a writer is “bringing their world with them,” we’re not just talking about hometowns and hobbies. We’re talking about the way their brain is wired to fixate. The stuff that shows up whether it belongs or not. The stuff that starts in the corner of a scene and ends up running the whole show.

Let’s break that down. I call them the Four Horsemen of Indulgence:

Taste

Obsession

Belief

The Thing You Can’t Shut Up About

Some overlap. Some contradiction. That’s the point. They’re messy. They’re personal. And they are the flavor.

1. TASTE – What You Love to Look At, Hear, Eat, Smell, Feel
Taste is aesthetic. It’s vibe. It’s the stuff you reach for first, before reason kicks in.

You know Tarantino’s taste. You know Sofia Coppola’s taste. You know Wes Anderson’s taste, even if you hate it. Their work drips with it. It’s not just surface-level style. It’s the lens they see the world through. You could give them a generic plot—“A man loses his wife”—and you’d still feel their hand in every shot, every sentence, every beat. That’s taste.

Your taste shows up in:

The clothes your characters wear

The food they eat

The music you imagine playing in a scene

The way you describe a room, a body, a sky

What you linger on, visually or emotionally

Taste is instinctual. It’s not a belief system. It’s what looks right to you. It’s why some people write entire stories set in diners, and others describe architecture for six pages straight. It’s why one person writes about outer space like a sterile void and another writes it like a neon playground.

Most people suppress their taste. They think it’s “too niche” or “too weird.” But the truth is, taste is how your world smells when you walk into it.

Let people breathe it.

2. OBSESSION – What You Circle Around Even When You’re Supposed to Be Writing Something Else
Obsessions are different from taste. Taste is flavor. Obsession is gravity. It pulls you back.

Here’s a trick: Look at everything you’ve written, even the scraps. What keeps showing up?

You meant to write a thriller, but your protagonist is having a breakdown in a grocery store aisle.

You keep writing about sisters, even when the plot doesn’t ask for it.

You keep killing off fathers.

You can’t stop writing scenes where people have power over someone else—and what they do with it.

Obsession doesn’t ask for permission. It doesn’t wait for genre to match. It leaks.

Sometimes it’s autobiographical. Sometimes it’s thematic. Sometimes it’s just a texture you’re drawn to. Addiction. Performance. Loneliness. Control. Water. Machines. Childhood. Grief. Nothingness.

Look at Stephen King. His obsession? Small towns, childhood trauma, the rot beneath normalcy.
Look at Gillian Flynn. Her obsession? Cruel women, self-loathing, beauty as menace.
Look at Junji Ito. Spiral patterns. Over and over and over. Until it’s not aesthetic—it’s doom.

You can fight it, or you can ride it. But if you ignore it, you end up writing safe, cold shit.

3. BELIEF – The Moral Architecture Underneath It All
Belief isn’t always religious. It’s how you think the world works.

Do you believe people are capable of redemption?

Do you believe systems crush individuals?

Do you believe love is a lie?

Do you believe truth matters?

Do you believe nothing matters?

Most of us don’t know our own beliefs until we write enough to see the pattern. But they’re in there.

Scorsese believes in sin. Even when the story isn’t overtly religious, his characters are never just bad guys. They’re fallen.
Aaron Sorkin believes that smart people can fix the world with speeches. Every show, every movie, is a sermon in a tailored suit.
Charlie Kaufman believes in the unreliability of self. His characters fall apart in layers. They doubt their own memories, their motives, their very identities.

Belief shapes consequences. It decides who wins and loses. It decides whether your story ends in hope or horror.

The more clearly you understand what you believe (even if it’s ugly), the more integrity your world will have. Even if readers don’t agree, they’ll feel the bones under the skin.

4. THE SHIT YOU CAN’T SHUT UP ABOUT – Your Soapbox
Every writer has at least one. It’s the thing that sneaks in through the dialogue. The thing your characters keep yelling about. The speech you wrote at 2am and thought, “God, that felt good.”

Sometimes it’s righteous. Sometimes it’s petty. Sometimes it’s dumb. Doesn’t matter.

Spike Lee’s characters rant about racism, gentrification, generational conflict.

Kevin Smith’s characters rant about pop culture, sex, retail life.

Diablo Cody’s characters rant about relationships, labels, teen bullshit.

You? You might rant about customer service. Or climate change. Or being misunderstood. Or whatever part of you feels erased in the world and finally gets to scream on the page.

That rant? That’s where your fire is. You don’t need to turn your story into a manifesto. But you do need to make space for your characters to echo you now and then. Not with subtlety. Not with metaphor.

Let them say the shit you’re not allowed to say in real life.

That’s indulgence. That’s voice. That’s why the hell you’re doing this in the first place.

So when people say, “Find your voice,” this is what they mean. Not tone. Not style. This.
Your taste. Your obsessions. Your beliefs. Your rants.

That’s your world.
You’re not borrowing it. You’re not inventing it.
You’re revealing it.

In the next section, we’ll break it down even further: How to recognize what’s yours, especially when it feels invisible to you.

For now, here’s your assignment:
Go through three things you’ve written. Old drafts. Journal entries. Even DMs.
Underline anything that feels like it came from your real life, your real taste, your real thoughts.
Then ask yourself—Why does this keep showing up?
You’re not chasing originality. You’re chasing honesty.
