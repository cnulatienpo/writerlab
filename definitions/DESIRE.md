DESIRE
What It Is
Desire is the engine of every story. Strip away the clever structure, the sparkling dialogue, even the world itself—and what you’re left with is want. Someone wants something. That’s it. That’s the spark. It can be small or world-ending. It can be as simple as wanting to get out of bed, or as huge as wanting to save the world or win someone’s love. Desire is the pulse behind every character, every decision, every scene, every lie, every moment of truth.

At its core, desire is a need unmet. A lack, a hunger, a hole at the center of a person. Sometimes the character knows exactly what they want. Sometimes they’re lying to themselves. Sometimes the reader sees it before the character does. But until someone wants something, nothing moves.

The Deep Dive: What Makes Desire
Desire isn’t just the “goal” written on a character sheet. It’s physical, emotional, social, spiritual. It’s layered and contradictory. Someone might want safety and excitement at the same time. They might want to be loved but also want to be left alone. Real desire is messy, raw, tangled up in fear and hope.

Every story—every good story—has desire running through its veins. That doesn’t mean everyone’s always chasing something obvious. Some characters hide their desire. Some fight it. Some bury it under denial or bravado or a mountain of self-hate. The tension between what a character wants, what they say they want, and what they actually do is the beating heart of drama.

Desire isn’t static. It shifts, grows, shrinks, flips inside out. What a character wants at the start of a story isn’t always what they need by the end. Sometimes they get what they want and realize it’s empty. Sometimes they fail and grow. Sometimes wanting is all there is.

Why Desire Matters
Without desire, there’s no story—just stuff happening. Desire is what puts pressure on the world, makes characters act, makes scenes matter. It’s the thing that makes the reader care. If you know what a character wants, you know what to fear for them, what to hope for, what to root against. Desire creates stakes.

Everything else in story bends to desire. Conflict is just what happens when desire runs into resistance—another person’s want, a locked door, the weight of the world. Structure is the shape of want—how it’s pursued, abandoned, fulfilled, or denied. Dialogue, subtext, pacing, even the smallest details—these are all shaped by who wants what, and how badly.

Desire is universal. It doesn’t matter if you’re writing about gods or losers, aliens or suburban teens. Every human action, every lie, every mistake, every punchline, every tragedy—underneath it is desire, plain and messy and true.

Why Most Stories Fail Without It
Ever read something and felt nothing? Probably missing desire. Characters drift through scenes, things happen, but you don’t care—because nobody wants anything, or at least you can’t feel it. Without desire, you get plot without stakes, dialogue without tension, action without meaning.

Stories break down when desire is fuzzy, or when it never changes. If a character’s want isn’t clear, or if it doesn’t evolve, the story stalls. The reader tunes out. No one roots for wallpaper.

How Desire Is Often Misunderstood
People confuse desire with plot (“the quest for the ring”), or with personality (“she’s ambitious”). But real desire is deeper. It’s felt, not just stated. Characters might not be honest about what they want—even to themselves. Sometimes the most interesting desire is hidden, or the character is fighting against it. Want isn’t just about the surface; it’s about the itch underneath.

A lot of writing advice boils it down to “what does your character want?” but the better question is, “what are they hungry for, what would they risk, what would they kill or save or break to get it?” And: “what are they terrified to want?”

How Desire Powers Everything
Conflict: All drama is want meeting resistance.

Theme: What people want (and whether they get it) is the story’s moral core.

Plot: Every major turn is shaped by someone’s desire colliding with the world.

Scene: Every scene is a negotiation of want—who gets closer, who loses ground.

Voice: The energy of a story comes from how raw, how true, how alive the desire feels.

The Many Faces of Desire
It’s not always “I want to win.” Desire can be twisted:

Longing for connection but sabotaging it

Craving escape but clinging to routine

Yearning for approval but acting out for attention

Needing safety but diving into danger

Desire is often in conflict with itself. Some of the best stories are about characters torn in half by wanting two things at once.

The Writer’s Job
If you do nothing else—make desire clear. Make it felt. If it’s hidden, show the cracks. If it’s dangerous, show the risk. Track how it changes. If you know what every character wants, even if they lie about it, you’ve got story fuel for days.

Everything else is just style.
