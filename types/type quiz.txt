What’s Your Character-Building Superpower?
Answer honestly, or just click the one that makes you laugh. No wrong answers, only writing energy.

1. You get a killer new story idea. What’s the first thing you do?
A) Write a fake Wikipedia page or fill out a dossier for the character, complete with astrological sign and allergies.
B) Start smashing together bits from real people, movies, and TikTok until you’ve got a weird new human.
C) Open a blank page and write a scene, no clue who’s in it, just see what happens.
D) Pace around talking as your character, accidentally scaring your roommate.
E) Write an angry poem or blast music and scribble about the “vibe” for an hour.
F) Meditate or stare at the wall until a voice starts talking to you and you just… write down what it says.
G) Sketch out your plot and realize, “crap, I need a villain. Time to engineer one.”
H) Steal your ex’s worst trait, your neighbor’s tattoos, and your favorite cartoon character’s catchphrase. Mix and serve.

2. You’re stuck on a scene. How do you get unstuck?
A) Make a spreadsheet about everyone’s backstory until you feel in control again.
B) Scroll social and grab a meme, a news headline, or some random DM for inspiration.
C) Start a new scene, maybe out of order—writing is how you figure it out, right?
D) Talk it out as your character, complete with wild hand gestures and at least three accents.
E) Write what you’re actually feeling, even if it makes no sense for the story.
F) Close your eyes and let the next line “arrive.” Trust the voice, even if it’s weird.
G) Ask yourself, “What is this scene supposed to do for the plot?” and build the character to do that job.
H) Borrow something real (an ex, a celebrity, a guy you saw in a Waffle House) and drop it right into the scene.

3. What’s your guilty pleasure as a writer?
A) Color-coding character arcs.
B) Collecting weird habits and overheard lines like Pokémon.
C) Finding out my character is a kleptomaniac because I wrote her stealing in chapter three and had no idea why.
D) Pretending to be my character in the shower, at the store, and sometimes at the DMV.
E) Writing fever-dream scenes about the feeling, not the plot.
F) Having characters talk to me in dreams and then typing it all out in a panic.
G) Building the perfect twist, then reverse-engineering a character to pull it off.
H) Frankenstein-ing together three people I hate into one loveable disaster.

4. Someone asks how you come up with your characters. You say:
A) “It’s all in the spreadsheet, bro.”
B) “I steal. Like, a lot. No shame.”
C) “Honestly, I just start writing and hope for the best.”
D) “I am my character. Don’t look at me like that.”
E) “They’re the part of me that’s still mad at my mom.”
F) “They just show up and won’t shut up until I write them.”
G) “Every story’s a machine. I build the parts.”
H) “Real life is just too damn useful not to steal from.”
