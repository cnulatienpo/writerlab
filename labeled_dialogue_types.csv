THOMAS PARKE DINVILLIERS  The Great Gatsby Chapter 1 In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that Ive been turning over in my mind ever since. Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, he told me, just remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages that youve had. He didnt say any more but weve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence Im in- clined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the con- fidences were unsoughtfrequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quiver- ing on the horizonfor the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my fa- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  ther snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth. And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I dont care what its founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I want- ed no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reactionGatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffect- ed scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the creative temperament it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. NoGatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short- winded elations of men. My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western city for three generations. The Car-  The Great Gatsby raways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that were descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the ac- tual founder of my line was my grandfathers brother who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father car- ries on today. I never saw this great-uncle but Im supposed to look like himwith special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in Fathers office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic mi- gration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universeso I decided to go east and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, Whyye- es with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,1,"and after various delays I came east, perma- nently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two. The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office sug- gested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and mut- tered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove. It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road. How do you get to West Egg village? he asked helpless- ly. I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casu- ally conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood. And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the treesjust as things grow in fast moviesI had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giv- ing air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Mae- cenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in collegeone year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale Newsand now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the well-rounded man. This isnt just an epigramlife is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.  The Great Gatsby It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North Ameri- ca. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovalslike the egg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact endbut their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size. I lived at West Egg, thewell, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bi- zarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standardit was a factual imi- tation of some Htel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsbys mansion. Or rather, as I didnt know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentle- man of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  view of the water, a partial view of my neighbors lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionairesall for eighty dol- lars a month. Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and Id known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,2,"Chicago. Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Havena national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-cli- max. His family were enormously wealthyeven in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproachbut now hed left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance hed brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to real- ize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that. Why they came east I dont know. They had spent a year in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didnt believe itI had no sight into Daisys heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seek- ing a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.  The Great Gatsby And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarce- ly knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial man- sion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardensfinal- ly when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch. He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that bodyhe seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enor- mous leveragea cruel body. His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the im- pression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he likedand there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts. Now, dont think my opinion on these matters is final, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  he seemed to say, just because Im stronger and more of a man than you are. We were in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own. We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch. Ive got a nice place here, he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly. Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub- nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore. It belonged to Demaine the oil man. He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. Well go inside. We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy- colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceilingand then rippled over the wine-colored rug, mak- ing a shadow on it as wind does on the sea. The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to 10 The Great Gatsby the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,3,"pic- ture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor. The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of itindeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apol- ogy for having disturbed her by coming in. The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to riseshe leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room. Im p-paralyzed with happiness. She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a mur- mur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (Ive heard it said that Daisys murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.) At any rate Miss Bakers lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back againthe object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me. I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me ques- tions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrange- ment of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouthbut there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered Listen, a prom- ise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour. I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me. Do they miss me? she cried ecstatically. The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and theres a per- sistent wail all night along the North Shore. How gorgeous! Lets go back, Tom. Tomorrow! Then she added irrelevantly, You ought to see the baby. Id like to. Shes asleep. Shes two years old. Havent you ever seen her? Never. Well, you ought to see her. Shes Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder. 1 The Great Gatsby What you doing, Nick? Im a bond man. Who with? I told him. Never heard of them, he remarked decisively. This annoyed me. You will, I answered shortly. You will if you stay in the East. Oh, Ill stay in the East, dont you worry, he said, glanc- ing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. Id be a God Damned fool to live any- where else. At this point Miss Baker said Absolutely! with such suddenness that I startedit was the first word she uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room. Im stiff, she complained, Ive been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember. Dont look at me, Daisy retorted. Ive been trying to get you to New York all afternoon. No, thanks, said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, Im absolutely in training. Her host looked at her incredulously. You are! He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. How you ever get anything done is beyond me. I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she got done. I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 breasted girl, with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
the-great-gatsby,4,"at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discon- tented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before. You live in West Egg, she remarked contemptuously. I know somebody there. I dont know a single You must know Gatsby. Gatsby? demanded Daisy. What Gatsby? Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively un- der mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square. Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind. Why CANDLES? objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her fingers. In two weeks itll be the longest day in the year. She looked at us all radiantly. Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it. We ought to plan something, yawned Miss Baker, sit- ting down at the table as if she were getting into bed. All right, said Daisy. Whatll we plan? She turned to me helplessly. What do people plan? 1 The Great Gatsby Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed ex- pression on her little finger. Look! she complained. I hurt it. We all lookedthe knuckle was black and blue. You did it, Tom, she said accusingly. I know you didnt mean to but you DID do it. Thats what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great big hulking physical specimen of a I hate that word hulking, objected Tom crossly, even in kidding. Hulking, insisted Daisy. Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtru- sively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were hereand they accepted Tom and me, making only a po- lite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West where an evening was hur- ried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself. You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy, I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. Cant you talk about crops or something? I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way. Civilizations going to pieces, broke out Tom violently. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Ive gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man God- dard? Why, no, I answered, rather surprised by his tone. Well, its a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we dont look out the white race will bewill be ut- terly submerged. Its all scientific stuff; its been proved. Toms getting very profound, said Daisy with an expres- sion of unthoughtful sadness. He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we Well, these books are all scientific, insisted Tom, glanc- ing at her impatiently. This fellow has worked out the whole thing. Its up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things. Weve got to beat them down, whispered Daisy, wink- ing ferociously toward the fervent sun. You ought to live in California began Miss Baker but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair. This idea is that were Nordics. I am, and you are and you are and After an infinitesimal hesitation he in- cluded Daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again. and weve produced all the things that go to make civili- zationoh, science and art and all that. Do you see? There was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me. Ill tell you a family secret, she whispered enthusiasti- 1 The Great Gatsby cally. Its about the butlers nose. Do you want to hear about the butlers nose? Thats why I came over tonight. Well, he",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
the-great-gatsby,5,"wasnt always a butler; he used to be the sil- ver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose Things went from bad to worse, suggested Miss Baker. Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position. For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affec- tion upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listenedthen the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk. The butler came back and murmured something close to Toms ear whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing. I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesnt he? She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation. An absolute rose? This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 went into the house. Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance conscious- ly devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said Sh! in a warning voice. A subdued im- passioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether. This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor I said. Dont talk. I want to hear what happens. Is something happening? I inquired innocently. You mean to say you dont know? said Miss Baker, hon- estly surprised. I thought everybody knew. I dont. Why she said hesitantly, Toms got some woman in New York. Got some woman? I repeated blankly. Miss Baker nodded. She might have the decency not to telephone him at din- ner-time. Dont you think? Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back at the table. It couldnt be helped! cried Daisy with tense gayety. She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and continued: I looked outdoors for a minute and its very romantic outdoors. Theres a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard 1 The Great Gatsby or White Star Line. Hes singing away her voice sang Its romantic, isnt it, Tom? Very romantic, he said, and then miserably to me: If its light enough after dinner I want to take you down to the stables. The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldnt guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guests shrill me- tallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguingmy own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police. The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly in- terested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee. Daisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its love- ly shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 We dont know each other very well, Nick, she said suddenly. Even if we are cousins. You didnt come to my wedding. I wasnt back from the war. Thats true. She hesitated. Well, Ive had",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,6,"a very bad time, Nick, and Im pretty cynical about everything. Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didnt say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter. I suppose she talks, andeats, and everything. Oh, yes. She looked at me absently. Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear? Very much. Itll show you how Ive gotten to feel aboutthings. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. All right, I said, Im glad its a girl. And I hope shell be a foolthats the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool. You see I think everythings terrible anyhow, she went on in a convinced way. Everybody thinks sothe most ad- vanced people. And I KNOW. Ive been everywhere and seen everything and done everything. Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Toms, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. SophisticatedGod, Im sophisticated! The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my 0 The Great Gatsby attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emo- tion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged. Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Postthe words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a sooth- ing tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms. When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand. To be continued, she said, tossing the magazine on the table, in our very next issue. Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up. Ten oclock, she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. Time for this good girl to go to bed. Jordans going to play in the tournament tomorrow, ex- plained Daisy, over at Westchester. Oh,youre JORdan Baker. I knew now why her face was familiarits pleasing con- temptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgot- ten long ago. Good night, she said softly. Wake me at eight, wont you. If youll get up. I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon. Of course you will, confirmed Daisy. In fact I think Ill arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and Ill sort ofohfling you together. You knowlock you up acci- dentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing Good night, called Miss Baker from the stairs. I havent heard a word. Shes a nice girl, said Tom after a moment. They oughtnt to let her run around the country this way. Who oughtnt to? inquired Daisy coldly. Her family. Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Be- sides, Nicks going to look after her, arent you, Nick? Shes going to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her. Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in si- lence. Is she from New York? I asked quickly. From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed togeth- er there. Our beautiful white Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the ve- randa? demanded Tom suddenly.  The Great Gatsby Did I? She looked at me. I cant seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, Im sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know Dont believe everything you hear, Nick, he advised me. I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
the-great-gatsby,7,"minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called Wait! I forgot to ask you something, and its important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West. Thats right, corroborated Tom kindly. We heard that you were engaged. Its libel. Im too poor. But we heard it, insisted Daisy, surprising me by open- ing up again in a flower-like way. We heard it from three people so it must be true. Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasnt even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come east. You cant stop going with an old friend on account of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumored into marriage. Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely richnevertheless, I was confused and a little dis- gusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in armsbut apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he had some woman in New York was Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart. Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wa- vered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alonefifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbors mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely move- ments and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to deter- mine what share was his of our local heavens. I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didnt call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alonehe stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seawardand distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had van-  The Great Gatsby ished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  Chapter 2 About half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashesa fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcen- dent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight. But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantictheir retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes

The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanans mistress. The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her I had no desire to meet herbut I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car. Were getting off! he insisted. I want you to meet my girl. I think hed tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do. I followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road un- der Doctor Eckleburgs persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  restaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garageRepairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Soldand I followed Tom inside. The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car vis- ible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anae- mic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes. Hello, Wilson, old man, said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder. Hows business? I cant complain, answered Wilson unconvincingly. When are you going to sell me that car? Next week; Ive got my man working on it now. Works pretty slow, dont he? No, he doesnt, said Tom coldly. And if you feel that way about it, maybe Id better sell it somewhere else after all. I dont mean that, explained Wilson quickly. I just meant His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a mo- ment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty  The Great Gatsby but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice: Get some chairs, why dont you, so somebody can sit down. Oh, sure, agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinityexcept his wife, who moved close to Tom. I want to see you, said Tom intently. Get on the next train. All right. Ill meet you by the news-stand on the lower level. She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door. We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the rail- road track. Terrible place, isnt it, said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg. Awful. It does her good to get away. Doesnt her husband object? Wilson? He",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
the-great-gatsby,9,"thinks she goes to see her sister in New Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  York. Hes so dumb he doesnt know hes alive. So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up togeth- er to New Yorkor not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train. She had changed her dress to a brown figured mus- lin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the news-stand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echo- ing drive she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glow- ing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass. I want to get one of those dogs, she said earnestly. I want to get one for the apartment. Theyre nice to havea dog. We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd re- semblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from his neck, cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an inde- terminate breed. What kind are they? asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he came to the taxi-window. All kinds. What kind do you want, lady? Id like to get one of those police dogs; I dont suppose you got that kind? 0 The Great Gatsby The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck. Thats no police dog, said Tom. No, its not exactly a polICE dog, said the man with disappointment in his voice. Its more of an airedale. He passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back. Look at that coat. Some coat. Thats a dog thatll never bother you with catching cold. I think its cute, said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. How much is it? That dog? He looked at it admiringly. That dog will cost you ten dollars. The airedaleundoubtedly there was an airedale con- cerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly whitechanged hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilsons lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture. Is it a boy or a girl? she asked delicately. That dog? That dogs a boy. Its a bitch, said Tom decisively. Heres your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it. We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldnt have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner. Hold on, I said, I have to leave you here. No, you dont, interposed Tom quickly. Myrtlell be hurt if you dont come up to the apartment. Wont you, Myrtle? Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Come on, she urged. Ill telephone my sister Cathe- rine. Shes said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know. Well, Id like to, but We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wil- son gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went haughtily in. Im going to have the McKees come up, she announced as we rose in the elevator. And of course I got to call up my sister, too. The apartment was on the top floora small living room, a small dining room, a small bedroom and a bath. The living room was crowded to the doors with a set of tap- estried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large hard dog biscuitsone of which decomposed apathetically  The Great Gatsby",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,10,"in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door. I have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it although until after eight oclock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Toms lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at the drug store on the corner. When I came back they had disap- peared so I sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of Simon Called Petereither it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted things because it didnt make any sense to me. Just as Tom and Myrtleafter the first drink Mrs. Wil- son and I called each other by our first namesreappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door. The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jin- gled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel. Mr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  He had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the artistic game and I gathered later that he was a photogra- pher and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilsons mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome and horrible. She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been mar- ried. Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time be- fore and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was con- verted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air. My dear, she told her sister in a high mincing shout, most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the bill youd of thought she had my appendicitus out. What was the name of the woman? asked Mrs. McKee. Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at peoples feet in their own homes.  The Great Gatsby I like your dress, remarked Mrs. McKee, I think its adorable. Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eye- brow in disdain. Its just a crazy old thing, she said. I just slip it on some- times when I dont care what I look like. But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean, pursued Mrs. McKee. If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it. We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face. I should change the light, he said after a moment. Id like to bring out the modelling of the features. And Id try to get hold of all the back hair. I wouldnt think of changing the light, cried Mrs. McK- ee. I think its Her husband said SH! and we all looked at the subject again whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet. You McKees have something to drink, he said. Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,11,"goes to sleep. I told that boy about the ice. Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. These people! You have to keep after them all the time. She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there. Ive done some nice things out on Long Island, asserted Mr. McKee. Tom looked at him blankly. Two of them we have framed downstairs. Two what? demanded Tom. Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Pointthe Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Pointthe Sea. The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch. Do you live down on Long Island, too? she inquired. I live at West Egg. Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsbys. Do you know him? I live next door to him. Well, they say hes a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wil- helms. Thats where all his money comes from. Really? She nodded. Im scared of him. Id hate to have him get anything on me. This absorbing information about my neighbor was in- terrupted by Mrs. McKees pointing suddenly at Catherine: Chester, I think you could do something with HER, she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention to Tom. Id like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.  The Great Gatsby Ask Myrtle, said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. Shell give you a letter of introduction, wont you, Myrtle? Do what? she asked, startled. Youll give McKee a letter of introduction to your hus- band, so he can do some studies of him. His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented. George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump, or something like that. Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: Neither of them can stand the person theyre married to. Cant they? Cant STAND them. She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. What I say is, why go on living with them if they cant stand them? If I was them Id get a divorce and get married to each other right away. Doesnt she like Wilson either? The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle who had overheard the question and it was violent and ob- scene. You see? cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. Its really his wife thats keeping them apart. Shes a Catholic and they dont believe in divorce. Daisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie. When they do get married, continued Catherine, theyre going west to live for a while until it blows over. Itd be more discreet to go to Europe. Oh, do you like Europe? she exclaimed surprisingly. I just got back from Monte Carlo. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  Really. Just last year. I went over there with another girl. Stay long? No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town! The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a mo- ment like the blue honey of the Mediterraneanthen the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room. I almost made a mistake, too, she declared vigorously. I almost married a little kyke whod been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: Lu- cille, that mans way below you! But if I hadnt met Chester, hed of got me sure. Yes, but listen, said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, at least you didnt marry him. I know I didnt. Well, I married him, said Myrtle, ambiguously. And thats the difference between your case and mine. Why did you, Myrtle? demanded Catherine. Nobody forced you to. Myrtle considered. I married him because I thought he was a gentleman, she said finally. I thought he knew something about breed- ing, but he wasnt fit to lick my shoe. You were crazy about him for a while, said Catherine. Crazy about him! cried Myrtle incredulously. Who said  The Great Gatsby I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no
the-great-gatsby,12,"I was about that man there. She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past. The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebodys best suit to get married in and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out. She looked around to see who was listening: Oh, is that your suit? I said. This is the first I ever heard about it. But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all af- ternoon. She really ought to get away from him, resumed Cath- erine to me. Theyve been living over that garage for eleven years. And Toms the first sweetie she ever had. The bottle of whiskeya second onewas now in con- stant demand by all present, excepting Catherine who felt just as good on nothing at all. Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild stri- dent argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, si- multaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  variety of life. Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom. It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes and I couldnt keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me and his white shirt-front pressed against my armand so I told him Id have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didnt hardly know I wasnt get- ting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was You cant live forever, you cant live forever. She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter. My dear, she cried, Im going to give you this dress as soon as Im through with it. Ive got to get another one to- morrow. Im going to make a list of all the things Ive got to get. A massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mothers grave thatll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I wont forget all the things I got to do. It was nine oclockalmost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a 0 The Great Gatsby photograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lath- er that had worried me all the afternoon. The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisys name. Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! shouted Mrs. Wilson. Ill say it whenever I want to! Daisy! Dai Making a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand. Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and womens voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain.

Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune and waiting for the four oclock train.  The Great Gatsby Chapter 3 There was music from my neighbors house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the cham- pagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cat- aracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his sta- tion wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before. Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New Yorkevery Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulp- less halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butlers thumb. At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsbys enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors- doeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another. By seven oclock the orchestra has arrivedno thin five- piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and sa- lons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and intro- ductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each others names. The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher.

I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsbys house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invit- ed. People were not invitedthey went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island and some- how they ended up at Gatsbys door. Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of be- havior associated with amusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission. I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robins egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morn- ing with a surprisingly formal note from his employerthe honor would be entirely Gatsbys, it said, if I would attend his little party that night. He had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented itsigned Jay Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  Gatsby in a majestic hand. Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies of people I didnt knowthough here and there was a face I had noticed on the commut- ing train. I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a lit- tle hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicin- ity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key. As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom I asked his where- abouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail tablethe only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone. I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer em- barrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little back- ward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden. Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by. Hello! I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed  The Great Gatsby unnaturally loud across the garden. I thought you might be here, she responded absently as I came up. I remembered you lived next door to She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that shed take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps. Hello! they cried together. Sorry you didnt win. That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the fi- nals the week before. You dont know who we are, said one of the girls in yel- low, but we met you here about a month ago. Youve dyed your hair since then, remarked Jordan, and I started but the girls had moved casually on and her re- mark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterers basket. With Jordans slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble. Do you come to these parties often? inquired Jordan of the girl beside her. The last one was the one I met you at, answered the girl, in an alert, confident voice. She turned to her companion: Wasnt it for you, Lucille? It was for Lucille, too. I like to come, Lucille said. I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  inside of a week I got a package from Croiriers with a new evening gown in it.

Somebody told me The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially. Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once. A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly. I dont think its so much THAT, argued Lucille skepti- cally; its more that he was a German spy during the war. One of the men nodded in confirmation. I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany, he assured us positively. Oh, no, said the first girl, it couldnt be that, because he was in the American army during the war. As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobodys look- ing at him. Ill bet he killed a man. She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimo- ny to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was  The Great Gatsby necessary to whisper about in this world. The first supperthere would be another one after mid- nightwas now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordans escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the country- sideEast Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety. Lets get out, whispered Jordan, after a somehow waste- ful and inappropriate half hour. This is much too polite for me. We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the hostI had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melan- choly way. The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there. She couldnt find him from the top of the steps, and he wasnt on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Goth- ic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas. A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spec- tacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and ex- amined Jordan from head to foot. What do you think? he demanded impetuously. About what? He waved his hand toward the book-shelves. About that. As a matter of fact you neednt bother to as- certain. I ascertained. Theyre real. The books? He nodded. Absolutely realhave pages and everything. I thought theyd be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, theyre absolutely real. Pages andHere! Lemme show you. Taking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures. See! he cried triumphantly. Its a bona fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fellas a regular Belasco. Its a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop toodidnt cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect? He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse. Who brought you? he demanded. Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought. Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answer- ing. I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt, he con- tinued. Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her 0 The Great Gatsby somewhere last night. Ive been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library. Has it? A little bit, I think. I cant tell yet. Ive only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? Theyre real. Theyre You told us. We shook hands with him gravely and went back out- doors. There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing young girls backward in eternal grace- less",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,16,"circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the cornersand a great num- ber of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing stunts all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twinswho turned out to be the girls in yellowdid a baby act in cos- tume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn. I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laugh- ter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger bowls Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound. At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled. Your face is familiar, he said, politely. Werent you in the Third Division during the war? Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion. I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eigh- teen. I knew Id seen you somewhere before. We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little vil- lages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning. Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound. What time? Any time that suits you best. It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jor- dan looked around and smiled. Having a gay time now? she inquired. Much better. I turned again to my new acquaintance. This is an unusual party for me. I havent even seen the host. I live over there I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation. For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to under- stand. Im Gatsby, he said suddenly. What! I exclaimed. Oh, I beg your pardon.  The Great Gatsby I thought you knew, old sport. Im afraid Im not a very good host. He smiled understandinglymuch more than under- standingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It facedor seemed to facethe whole ex- ternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it van- ishedand I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself Id got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care. Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified him- self a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn. If you want anything just ask for it, old sport, he urged me. Excuse me. I will rejoin you later. When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years. Who is he? I demanded. Do you know? Hes just a man named Gatsby. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do? Now YOUre started on the subject, she answered with a wan smile. Well,he told me once he was an Oxford man. A dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away. However, I dont believe it. Why not? I dont know, she insisted, I just dont think he went there. Something in her tone reminded me of the other girls I think he killed a man, and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
the-great-gatsby,17,"would have accepted without question the infor- mation that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was compre- hensible. But young men didntat least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didntdrift coolly out of no- where and buy a palace on Long Island Sound. Anyhow he gives large parties, said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. And I like large parties. Theyre so intimate. At small parties there isnt any privacy. There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden. Ladies and gentlemen, he cried. At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoffs latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was  The Great Gatsby a big sensation. He smiled with jovial condescension and added Some sensation! whereupon everybody laughed. The piece is known, he concluded lustily, as Vladimir Tostoffs Jazz History of the World. The nature of Mr. Tostoffs composition eluded me, be- cause just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractive- ly tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the Jazz History of the World was over girls were putting their heads on mens shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into mens arms, even into groups knowing that some one would ar- rest their fallsbut no one swooned backward on Gatsby and no French bob touched Gatsbys shoulder and no sing- ing quartets were formed with Gatsbys head for one link. I beg your pardon. Gatsbys butler was suddenly standing beside us. Miss Baker? he inquired. I beg your pardon but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone. With me? she exclaimed in surprise. Yes, madame. She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in aston- ishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  clothesthere was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings. I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many-win- dowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordans undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical con- versation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside. The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that every- thing was very very sadshe was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyr- ic again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeksnot freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep. She had a fight with a man who says hes her husband, explained a girl at my elbow. I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordans party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asun-  The Great Gatsby der by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife after attempt- ing to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacksat intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed You promised! into his ear. The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably so- ber men and their highly",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,18,"indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices. Whenever he sees Im having a good time he wants to go home. Never heard anything so selfish in my life. Were always the first ones to leave. So are we. Well, were almost the last tonight, said one of the men sheepishly. The orchestra left half an hour ago. In spite of the wives agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short strug- gle, and both wives were lifted kicking into the night. As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye. Jordans party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands. Ive just heard the most amazing thing, she whispered. How long were we in there? Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  Why,about an hour. It wassimply amazing, she repeated abstractedly. But I swore I wouldnt tell it and here I am tantalizing you. She yawned gracefully in my face. Please come and see me. Phone book. Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney How- ard. My aunt. She was hurrying off as she talkedher brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door. Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsbys guests who were clus- tered around him. I wanted to explain that Id hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden. Dont mention it, he enjoined me eagerly. Dont give it another thought, old sport. The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. And dont forget were going up in the hydro- plane tomorrow morning at nine oclock. Then the butler, behind his shoulder: Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir. All right, in a minute. Tell them Ill be right there. good night. Good night. Good night. He smiledand suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. Good night, old sport. Good night. But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights  The Great Gatsby illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch be- side the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coup which had left Gatsbys drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the de- tachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene. A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleas- ant, puzzled way. See! he explained. It went in the ditch. The fact was infinitely astonishing to himand I rec- ognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the manit was the late patron of Gatsbys library. Howd it happen? He shrugged his shoulders. I know nothing whatever about mechanics, he said de- cisively. But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall? Dont ask me, said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. I know very little about drivingnext to nothing. It happened, and thats all I know. Well, if youre a poor driver you oughtnt to try driving at night. But I wasnt even trying, he explained indignantly, I wasnt even trying. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  An awed hush fell upon the bystanders. Do you want to commit suicide? Youre lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing! You dont understand, explained the criminal. I wasnt driving. Theres another man in the car. The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained Ah-h-h! as the door of the coup swung slowly open. The crowdit was now a crowdstepped back in- voluntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tenta- tively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no

Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster. Whas matter? he inquired calmly. Did we run outa gas? Look! Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheelhe stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky. It came off, some one explained. He nodded. At first I din notice wed stopped. A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice: Wonderff tell me where theres a gasline station? 0 The Great Gatsby At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond. Back out, he suggested after a moment. Put her in re- verse. But the WHEELS off! He hesitated. No harm in trying, he said. The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsbys house, making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sud- den emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the fig- ure of the host who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell. Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal af- fairs. Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother be- gan throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away. I took dinner usually at the Yale Clubfor some reason it was the gloomiest event of my dayand then I went up- stairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel and over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station. I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic wom- en from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropoli- tan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in otherspoor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinneryoung clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poi- gnant moments of night and life. Again at eight oclock, when the dark lanes of the For- ties were five deep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the  The Great Gatsby theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted ciga- rettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well. For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in mid- summer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and ev- ery one knew her name. Then it was something more.

When we were on a house- party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about itand suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisys. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapersa sug- gestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandalthen died away. A caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind. Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever shrewd men and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impos- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  sible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasnt able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this unwillingness I sup- pose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body. It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeplyI was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one mans coat. Youre a rotten driver, I protested. Either you ought to be more careful or you oughtnt to drive at all. I am careful. No, youre not. Well, other people are, she said lightly. Whats that got to do with it? Theyll keep out of my way, she insisted. It takes two to make an accident. Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself. I hope I never will, she answered. I hate careless people. Thats why I like you. Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. Id been writing letters once a week and signing  The Great Gatsby them: Love, Nick, and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspi- ration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off be- fore I was free. Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.

One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crys- tal glass. Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names of those who came to Gatsbys house that sum- mer. It is an old time-table now, disintegrating at its folds and headed This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922. But I can still read the grey names and they will give you a bet- ter impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsbys hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him. From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a man named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a cor- ner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert  The Great Gatsby Auerbach and Mr. Chrysties wife) and Edgar Beaver, whose hair they say turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all. Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,21,"remember. He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraed- ers and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the grav- el drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swetts automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies came too and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink and the Hammer- heads and Beluga the tobacco importer and Belugas girls. From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the state sena- tor and Newton Orchid who controlled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.

(Rot-Gut) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lillythey came to gamble and when Fer- ret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day. A man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became known as the boarderI doubt if Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace ODonavan and Lester Meyer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennick- ers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a sub- way train in Times Square. Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their namesJaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodi- ous names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be. In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina OBrien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiance, and Ardita Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten. All these people came to Gatsbys house in the summer. At nine oclock, one morning late in July Gatsbys gor- geous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave  The Great Gatsby out a burst of melody from its three noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach. Good morning, old sport. Youre having lunch with me today and I thought wed ride up together. He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly Americanthat comes, I suppose, with the absence of lift- ing work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient open- ing and closing of a hand. He saw me looking with admiration at his car. Its pretty, isnt it, old sport. He jumped off to give me a better view. Havent you ever seen it before? Id seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its mon- strous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many lay- ers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town. I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,22,"he had little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate road- house next door. And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadnt reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indeci- sively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit. Look here, old sport, he broke out surprisingly. Whats your opinion of me, anyhow? A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves. Well, Im going to tell you something about my life, he interrupted. I dont want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear. So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls. Ill tell you Gods truth. His right hand suddenly or- dered divine retribution to stand by. I am the son of some wealthy people in the middle-westall dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition. He looked at me sidewaysand I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase educated at Oxford, or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt his whole state- ment fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasnt something a little sinister about him after all. What part of the middle-west? I inquired casually. San Francisco. 0 The Great Gatsby I see. My family all died and I came into a good deal of mon- ey. His voice was solemn as if the memory of that sud- den extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at him convinced me otherwise. After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of EuropeParis, Venice, Romecollecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had hap- pened to me long ago. With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned character leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne. Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die but I seemed to bear an enchant- ed life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took two machine-gun de- tachments so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldnt advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a decorationeven Mon- tenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea! Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at themwith his smile. The smile comprehended Monte- negros troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegros warm little heart. My increduli- ty was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines. He reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm. Thats the one from Montenegro. To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. Orderi di Danilo, ran the circular legend, Montenegro, Nicolas Rex. Turn it. Major Jay Gatsby, I read, For Valour Extraordinary. Heres another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Ox- ford days. It was taken in Trinity Quadthe man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster. It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, young- erwith a cricket bat in his hand. Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnaw- ings of his broken heart. Im going to make a big request of you today, he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, so I thought you  The Great Gatsby ought to",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,23,"know something about me. I didnt want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find my- self among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me. He hesitated. Youll hear about it this afternoon. At lunch? No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that youre taking Miss Baker to tea. Do you mean youre in love with Miss Baker? No, old sport, Im not. But Miss Baker has kindly con- sented to speak to you about this matter. I hadnt the faintest idea what this matter was, but I was more annoyed than interested. I hadnt asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment I was sorry Id ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn. He wouldnt say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by. With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoriaonly half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar jugjugSPAT! of a motor cycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside. All right, old sport, called Gatsby. We slowed down. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  Taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the mans eyes. Right you are, agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse ME! What was that? I inquired. The picture of Oxford? I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year. Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory mon- ey. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsbys splendid car was included in their somber holiday. As we crossed Blackwells Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry. Anything can happen now that weve slid over this bridge, I thought; anything at all. Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular won- der. Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cel-  The Great Gatsby lar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man. Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem. A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regard- ed me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness. so I took one look at him said Mr. Wolfshiem, shak- ing my hand earnestly, and what do you think I did? What? I inquired politely. But evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose. I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid, All right, Katspaugh, dont pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth. He shut it then and there. Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambu- latory abstraction. Highballs? asked the head waiter. This is a nice restaurant here, said Mr. Wolfshiem look- ing at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. But I like across the street better! Yes, highballs, agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolf- shiem: Its too hot over there. Hot and smallyes, said Mr. Wolfshiem, but full of memories. What place is that? I asked.

It was six of us at the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was al- most morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. All right, says Rosy and begins to get up and I pulled him down in his chair. Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but dont you, so help me, move outside this room. It was four oclock in the morning then, and if wed of raised the blinds wed of seen daylight. Did he go? I asked innocently. Sure he went,Mr. Wolfshiems nose flashed at me in- dignantlyHe turned around in the door and says, Dont let that waiter take away my coffee! Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away. Four of them were electrocuted, I said, remembering. Five with Becker. His nostrils turned to me in an in- terested way. I understand youre looking for a business gonnegtion. The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me: Oh, no, he exclaimed, this isnt the man! No? Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed. This is just a friend. I told you wed talk about that some  The Great Gatsby other time. I beg your pardon, said Mr. Wolfshiem, I had a wrong man. A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forget- ting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the roomhe completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table. Look here, old sport, said Gatsby, leaning toward me, Im afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car. There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it. I dont like mysteries, I answered. And I dont under- stand why you wont come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker? Oh, its nothing underhand, he assured me. Miss Bak- ers a great sportswoman, you know, and shed never do anything that wasnt all right. Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up and hurried from the room leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table. He has to telephone, said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. Fine fellow, isnt he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman. Yes. Hes an Oggsford man. Oh! Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College? Ive heard of it. Its one of the most famous colleges in the world. Have you known Gatsby for a long time? I inquired. Several years, he answered in a gratified way. I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: Theres the kind of man youd like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister. He paused. I see youre looking at my cuff buttons. I hadnt been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory. Finest specimens of human molars, he informed me. Well! I inspected them. Thats a very interesting idea. Yeah. He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. Yeah, Gatsbys very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friends wife. When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet. I have enjoyed my lunch, he said, and Im going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome. Dont hurry, Meyer, said Gatsby, without enthusiasm.

Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: Hes the man who fixed the Worlds Se- ries back in 1919. Fixed the Worlds Series? I repeated. The idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the Worlds Series had been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that mere- ly HAPPENED, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million peoplewith the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe. How did he happen to do that? I asked after a minute. He just saw the opportunity. Why isnt he in jail? They cant get him, old sport. Hes a smart man. I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room. Come along with me for a minute, I said. Ive got to say Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  hello to someone. When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction. Whereve you been? he demanded eagerly. Daisys furi- ous because you havent called up. This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan. They shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsbys face. Howve you been, anyhow? demanded Tom of me. Howd you happen to come up this far to eat? Ive been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby. I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there. One October day in nineteen-seventeen (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel) I was walk- ing along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disap- proving way. The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fays house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Tay- 0 The Great Gatsby lor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, anyways, for an hour! When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didnt see me until I was five feet away. Hello Jordan, she called unexpectedly. Please come here. I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldnt come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby and I didnt lay eyes on him again for over four yearseven after Id met him on Long Island I didnt realize it was the same man. That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didnt see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly old- er crowdwhen she went with anyone at all. Wild rumors were circulating about herhow her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effec- tually prevented, but she wasnt on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After that she didnt play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 short-sighted young men in town who couldnt get into the army at all.

In June she",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,26,"married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour be- fore the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dressand as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other. Gratulate me, she muttered. Never had a drink before but oh, how I do enjoy it. Whats the matter, Daisy? I was scared, I can tell you; Id never seen a girl like that before. Here, dearis. She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. Take em downstairs and give em back to whoever they belong to. Tell em all Daisys change her mine. Say Daisys change her mine!. She began to cryshe cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mothers maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldnt let go of the letter. She  The Great Gatsby took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow. But she didnt say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five oclock she married Tom Buchan- an without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months trip to the South Seas. I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought Id never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a minute shed look around uneasily and say Wheres Tom gone? and wear the most abstract- ed expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them togeth- erit made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the pa- pers too because her arm was brokenshe was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel. The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps because she doesnt drink. Its a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregulari- ty of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they dont see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at alland yet theres something in that voice of hers. Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked youdo you re- member?if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said What Gatsby? and when I described himI was half asleepshe said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know. It wasnt until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car. When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight: Im the Sheik of Araby, Your love belongs to me.

Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay. Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor. He wants to know continued Jordan if youll in- vite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over. The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed star- light to casual moths so that he could come over some afternoon to a strangers garden. Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing? Hes afraid. Hes waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see hes a regular tough underneath it all. Something worried me. Why didnt he ask you to arrange a meeting? He wants her to see his house, she explained. And your house is right next door. Oh! I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night, went on Jordan, but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New Yorkand I thought hed go mad: Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  I dont want to do anything out of the way! he kept say- ing. I want to see her right next door. When I said you were a particular friend of Toms he started to abandon the whole idea. He doesnt know very much about Tom, though he says hes read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisys name. It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordans golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner. Suddenly I wasnt thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of this clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excite- ment: There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired. And Daisy ought to have something in her life, mur- mured Jordan to me. Does she want to see Gatsby? Shes not to know about it. Gatsby doesnt want her to know. Youre just supposed to invite her to tea. We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so I drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.  The Great Gatsby Chapter 5 When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. Two oclock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongat- ing glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw that it was Gatsbys house, lit from tower to cellar. At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into hide-and-go-seek or sardines-in- the-box with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasnt a sound. Only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn. Your place looks like the worlds fair, I said. Does it? He turned his eyes toward it absently. I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Lets go to Coney Is- land, old sport. In my car. Its too late. Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I havent made use of it all summer. Ive got to go to bed. All right. He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness. I talked with Miss Baker, I said after a moment.

I dont want to put you to any trouble, you see. How about the day after tomorrow? He considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: I want to get the grass cut, he said. We both looked at the grassthere was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept ex- panse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass. Theres another little thing, he said uncertainly, and hesitated. Would you rather put it off for a few days? I asked. Oh, it isnt about that. At least He fumbled with a series of beginnings. Why, I thoughtwhy, look here, old sport, you dont make much money, do you? Not very much. This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently. I thought you didnt, if youll pardon myyou see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I thought that if you dont make very muchYoure selling bonds, arent you, old sport? Trying to. Well, this would interest you. It wouldnt take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It  The Great Gatsby happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing. I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a ser- vice to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there. Ive got my hands full, I said. Im much obliged but I couldnt take on any more work. You wouldnt have to do any business with Wolfshiem. Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the gon- negtion mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping Id begin a con- versation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home. The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I didnt know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Is- land or for how many hours he glanced into rooms while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the of- fice next morning and invited her to come to tea. Dont bring Tom, I warned her. What? Dont bring Tom. Who is Tom? she asked innocently. The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven oclock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village to Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers. The flowers were unnecessary, for at two oclock a green- house arrived from Gatsbys, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt and gold-col- ored tie hurried in. He was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes. Is everything all right? he asked immediately. The grass looks fine, if thats what you mean. What grass? he inquired blankly. Oh, the grass in the yard. He looked out the window at it, but judging from his expression I dont believe he saw a thing. Looks very good, he remarked vaguely. One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape ofof tea? I took him into the pantry where he looked a little re- proachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop. Will they do? I asked. Of course, of course! Theyre fine! and he added hol- lowly, old sport. The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clays Econom- ics, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were 0 The Great Gatsby taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home. Whys that? Nobodys coming to tea. Its too late! He looked at his watch as if there",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
the-great-gatsby,29,"was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. I cant wait all day. Dont be silly; its just two minutes to four. He sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and si- multaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard. Under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisys face, tipped side- ways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile. Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one? The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car. Are you in love with me, she said low in my ear. Or why did I have to come alone? Thats the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour. Come back in an hour, Ferdie. Then in a grave murmur, His name is Ferdie. Does the gasoline affect his nose? Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 I dont think so, she said innocently. Why? We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted. Well, thats funny! I exclaimed. Whats funny? She turned her head as there was a light, dignified knock- ing at the front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragi- cally into my eyes. With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and dis- appeared into the living room. It wasnt a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain. For half a minute there wasnt a sound. Then from the living room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisys voice on a clear artificial note. I certainly am awfully glad to see you again. A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall so I went into the room. Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair. Weve met before, muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced  The Great Gatsby momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand. Im sorry about the clock, he said. My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldnt muster up a single commonplace out of the thou- sand in my head. Its an old clock, I told them idiotically. I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor. We havent met for many years, said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be. Five years next November. The automatic quality of Gatsbys answer set us all back at least another minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray. Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a cer- tain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked consci- entiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasnt an end in itself I made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet. Where are you going? demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm. Ill be back. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  Ive got to speak to you about something before you go. He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered: Oh, God! in a miserable",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes
the-great-gatsby,30,"way. Whats the matter? This is a terrible mistake, he said, shaking his head from side to side, a terrible, terrible mistake. Youre just embarrassed, thats all, and luckily I added: Daisys embarrassed too. Shes embarrassed? he repeated incredulously. Just as much as you are. Dont talk so loud. Youre acting like a little boy, I broke out impatiently. Not only that but youre rude. Daisys sitting in there all alone. He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room. I walked out the back wayjust as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour be- foreand ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsbys gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehis- toric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsbys enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the period craze, a decade before, and there was a story that hed agreed to pay five years taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have  The Great Gatsby their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Familyhe went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while occasion- ally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry. After half an hour the sun shone again and the grocers automobile rounded Gatsbys drive with the raw material for his servants dinnerI felt sure he wouldnt eat a spoon- ful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little, now and the, with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too. I went inafter making every possible noise in the kitch- en short of pushing over the stovebut I dont believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisys face was smeared with tears and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her hand- kerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room. Oh, hello, old sport, he said, as if he hadnt seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  hands. Its stopped raining. Has it? When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. What do you think of that? Its stopped raining. Im glad, Jay. Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy. I want you and Daisy to come over to my house, he said, Id like to show her around. Youre sure you want me to come? Absolutely, old sport. Daisy went upstairs to wash her facetoo late I thought with humiliation of my towelswhile Gatsby and I waited on the lawn. My house looks well, doesnt it? he demanded. See how the whole front of it catches the light. I agreed that it was splendid. Yes. His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it. I thought you inherited your money. I did, old sport, he said automatically, but I lost most of it in the big panicthe panic of the war. I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered Thats my affair, before he realized that it wasnt the appropriate re- ply.  The Great Gatsby Oh, Ive been in several things, he corrected himself. I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. But Im not in either one now. He looked at me with more attention. Do you mean youve",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no

That huge place THERE? she cried pointing. Do you like it? I love it, but I dont see how you live there all alone. I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people. Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and entered by the big postern. With en- chanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at- the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees. And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and Restoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under or- ders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of the Merton College Library I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.

It was Mr. Klipspringer, the boarder. I had seen him wander- ing hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsbys own apartment, a bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall. He hadnt once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs. His bedroom was the simplest room of allexcept where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh. Its the funniest thing, old sport, he said hilariously. I cantwhen I try to He had passed visibly through two states and was en- tering upon a third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her pres- ence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at  The Great Gatsby an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock. Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high. Ive got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall. He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the ta- ble in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted highershirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily. Theyre such beautiful shirts, she sobbed, her voice muf- fled in the thick folds. It makes me sad because Ive never seen suchsuch beautiful shirts before. After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowersbut outside Gatsbys window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound. If it wasnt for the mist we could see your home across the bay, said Gatsby. You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.

the-great-gatsby,32,"Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. I began to walk about the room, examining various in- definite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk. Whos this? That? Thats Mr. Dan Cody, old sport. The name sounded faintly familiar. Hes dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago. There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting cos- tume, on the bureauGatsby with his head thrown back defiantlytaken apparently when he was about eighteen. I adore it! exclaimed Daisy. The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadouror a yacht. Look at this, said Gatsby quickly. Heres a lot of clip- pingsabout you. They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver. Yes. Well, I cant talk now. I cant talk now, old sport. I said a SMALL town. He must know what a small town is. Well, hes no use to us if Detroit is his idea 100 The Great Gatsby of a small town. He rang off. Come here QUICK! cried Daisy at the window. The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea. Look at that, she whispered, and then after a moment: Id like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around. I tried to go then, but they wouldnt hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone. I know what well do, said Gatsby, well have Klip- springer play the piano. He went out of the room calling Ewing! and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slight- ly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. He was now decently clothed in a sport shirt open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue. Did we interrupt your exercises? inquired Daisy polite- ly. I was asleep, cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of em- barrassment. That is, Id BEEN asleep. Then I got up. Klipspringer plays the piano, said Gatsby, cutting him off. Dont you, Ewing, old sport? I dont play well. I dontI hardly play at all. Im all out of prac Well go downstairs, interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 101 full of light. In the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisys cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall. When Klipspringer had played The Love Nest he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom. Im all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldnt play. Im all out of prac Dont talk so much, old sport, commanded Gatsby. Play! IN THE MORNING, IN THE EVENING, AINT WE GOT FUN Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was gen- erating on the air. ONE THINGS SURE AND NOTHINGS SURER THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET CHILDREN. IN THE MEANTIME, 10 The Great Gatsby IN BETWEEN TIME As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsbys face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreamsnot through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way.

the-great-gatsby,33,"As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most with its fluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldnt be over-dreamedthat voice was a deathless song. They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didnt know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there to- gether. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 10 Chapter 6 About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsbys door and asked him if he had anything to say. Anything to say about what? inquired Gatsby politely. Why,any statement to give out. It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsbys name around his office in a connection which he either wouldnt reveal or didnt fully understand. This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hur- ried out to see. It was a random shot, and yet the reporters instinct was right. Gatsbys notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary legends such as the under- ground pipe-line to Canada attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didnt live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isnt easy to say. James Gatzthat was really, or at least legally, his name. He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his careerwhen 10 The Great Gatsby he saw Dan Codys yacht drop anchor over the most insidi- ous flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jer- sey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour. I suppose hed had the name ready for a long time, even then. His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm peo- plehis imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of Goda phrase which, if it means anything, means just thatand he must be about His Fathers Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretri- cious beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end. For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days. He knew women early and since they spoiled him he became con- temptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted. But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 10 grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies un- til drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairys wing. An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitors work with which he was to pay his way",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes
the-great-gatsby,34,"through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Codys yacht dropped anchor in the shal- lows along shore. Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Sev- enty-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Main- tenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism of 1902. He 10 The Great Gatsby had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatzs destiny at Little Girl Bay. To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world. I suppose he smiled at Codyhe had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting cap. And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too. He was employed in a vague personal capacitywhile he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skip- per, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the con- tinent. It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died. I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsbys bedroom, a grey, florid man with a hard empty facethe pioneer de- bauchee who during one phase of American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the fron- tier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to Cody that Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 10 Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay par- ties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone. And it was from Cody that he inherited moneya legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didnt get it. He nev- er understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substanti- ality of a man. He told me all this very much later, but Ive put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which werent even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away. It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several weeks I didnt see him or hear his voice on the phonemostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadnt been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadnt happened be- fore. They were a party of three on horsebackTom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding 10 The Great Gatsby habit who had been there previously. Im delighted to see you, said Gatsby standing on his porch. Im delighted that you dropped in. As though they cared! Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar. He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. Ill have something to drink for you in just a minute. He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade?",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,35,"No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks. Im sorry Did you have a nice ride? Very good roads around here. I suppose the automobiles Yeah. Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted the introduction as a stranger. I believe weve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan. Oh, yes, said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not re- membering. So we did. I remember very well. About two weeks ago. Thats right. You were with Nick here. I know your wife, continued Gatsby, almost aggressive- ly. That so? Tom turned to me. You live near here, Nick? Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 10 Next door. That so? Mr. Sloane didnt enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing ei- theruntil unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial. Well all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby, she suggested. What do you say? Certainly. Id be delighted to have you. Be ver nice, said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. Well think ought to be starting home. Please dont hurry, Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now and he wanted to see more of Tom. Why dont youwhy dont you stay for supper? I wouldnt be sur- prised if some other people dropped in from New York. You come to supper with ME, said the lady enthusiasti- cally. Both of you. This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet. Come along, he saidbut to her only. I mean it, she insisted. Id love to have you. Lots of room. Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didnt see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldnt. Im afraid I wont be able to, I said. Well, you come, she urged, concentrating on Gatsby. Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear. We wont be late if we start now, she insisted aloud. I havent got a horse, said Gatsby. I used to ride in the army but Ive never bought a horse. Ill have to follow you in 110 The Great Gatsby my car. Excuse me for just a minute. The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside. My God, I believe the mans coming, said Tom. Doesnt he know she doesnt want him? She says she does want him. She has a big dinner party and he wont know a soul there. He frowned. I wonder where in the devil he met Dai- sy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish. Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses. Come on, said Mr. Sloane to Tom, were late. Weve got to go. And then to me: Tell him we couldnt wait, will you? Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door. Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisys running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsbys party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressivenessit stands out in my memory from Gatsbys other parties that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadnt been there before. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 111 Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own stan- dards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisys eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have ex- pended your own powers of adjustment. They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds Daisys voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat. These things excite me SO, she whispered. If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and Ill be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. Im giving out green Look around, suggested Gatsby. Im looking around. Im having a marvelous You must see the faces of many people youve heard about. Toms arrogant eyes roamed the crowd. We dont go around very much, he said. In fact I was just thinking I dont",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
the-great-gatsby,36,"know a soul here. Perhaps you know that lady. Gatsby indicated a gor- geous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies. Shes lovely, said Daisy. The man bending over her is her director. He took them ceremoniously from group to group: 11 The Great Gatsby Mrs. Buchanan and Mr. Buchanan After an in- stants hesitation he added: the polo player. Oh no, objected Tom quickly, Not me. But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom re- mained the polo player for the rest of the evening. Ive never met so many celebrities! Daisy exclaimed. I liked that manwhat was his name?with the sort of blue nose. Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small pro- ducer. Well, I liked him anyhow. Id a little rather not be the polo player, said Tom pleas- antly, Id rather look at all these famous people inin oblivion. Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative fox-trotI had never seen him dance before. Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden: In case theres a fire or a flood, she explained, or any act of God. Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. Do you mind if I eat with some people over here? he said. A fellows getting off some funny stuff. Go ahead, answered Daisy genially, And if you want to take down any addresses heres my little gold pencil. She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was common but pretty, and I knew that except for the half hour shed been alone with Gatsby she wasnt having a good time. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault Gatsby had been called to the phone and Id enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now. How do you feel, Miss Baedeker? The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes. Wha? A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedekers defence: Oh, shes all right now. When shes had five or six cock- tails she always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone. I do leave it alone, affirmed the accused hollowly. We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: Theres somebody that needs your help, Doc. Shes much obliged, Im sure, said another friend, with- out gratitude. But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool. Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool, mum- bled Miss Baedeker. They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey. Then you ought to leave it alone, countered Doctor Civ- et. Speak for yourself! cried Miss Baedeker violently. Your hand shakes. I wouldnt let you operate on me! It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was 11 The Great Gatsby standing with Daisy and watching the moving picture di- rector and his Star. They were still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek. I like her, said Daisy, I think shes lovely. But the rest offended herand inarguably, because it wasnt a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented place that Broadway had begot- ten upon a Long Island fishing villageappalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand. I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing- room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an in- visible glass. Who is this Gatsby anyhow? demanded Tom suddenly. Some",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
the-great-gatsby,37,"big bootlegger? Whered you hear that? I inquired. I didnt hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know. Not Gatsby, I said shortly. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet. Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together. A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisys fur collar. At least theyre more interesting than the people we know, she said with an effort. You didnt look so interested. Well, I was. Tom laughed and turned to me. Did you notice Daisys face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower? Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhyth- mic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air. Lots of people come who havent been invited, she said suddenly. That girl hadnt been invited. They simply force their way in and hes too polite to object. Id like to know who he is and what he does, insisted Tom. And I think Ill make a point of finding out. I can tell you right now, she answered. He owned some drug stores, a lot of drug stores. He built them up himself. The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive. Good night, Nick, said Daisy. Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where Three oClock in the Morning, a neat, sad little waltz 11 The Great Gatsby of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsbys party there were romantic pos- sibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinite- ly rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one mo- ment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion. I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guest rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired. She didnt like it, he said immediately. Of course she did. She didnt like it, he insisted. She didnt have a good time. He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depres- sion. I feel far away from her, he said. Its hard to make her understand. You mean about the dance? The dance? He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers. Old sport, the dance is unim- portant. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: I never loved you. After she had obliter- ated three years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her housejust as if it were five years ago. And she doesnt understand, he said. She used to be able to understand. Wed sit for hours He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flow- ers. I wouldnt ask too much of her, I ventured. You cant repeat the past. Cant repeat the past? he cried incredulously. Why of course you can! He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurk- ing here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand. Im going to fix everything just the way it was before, he said, nodding determinedly. Shell see. He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was. One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
the-great-gatsby,38,"the leaves were falling, and 11 The Great Gatsby they came to a place where there were no trees and the side- walk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the treeshe could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder. His heart beat faster and faster as Daisys white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the in- carnation was complete. Through all he said, even through his appalling sen- timentality, I was reminded of somethingan elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard some- where a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb mans, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 Chapter 7 It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday nightand, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Tri- malchio was over. Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find outan unfamiliar butler with a vil- lainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door. Is Mr. Gatsby sick? Nope. After a pause he added sir in a dilatory, grudg- ing way. I hadnt seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over. Who? he demanded rudely. Carraway. Carraway. All right, Ill tell him. Abruptly he slammed the door. My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate sup- plies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the 10 The Great Gatsby village was that the new people werent servants at all. Next day Gatsby called me on the phone. Going away? I inquired. No, old sport. I hear you fired all your servants. I wanted somebody who wouldnt gossip. Daisy comes over quite oftenin the afternoons. So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes. Theyre some people Wolfshiem wanted to do some- thing for. Theyre all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel. I see. He was calling up at Daisys requestwould I come to lunch at her house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed re- lieved to find that I was coming. Something was up. And yet I couldnt believe that they would choose this occasion for a sceneespecially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden. The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the floor. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 Oh, my! she gasped. I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arms length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon itbut ev- ery one near by, including the woman, suspected",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes
the-great-gatsby,39,"me just the same. Hot! said the conductor to familiar faces. Some weath- er! Hot! Hot! Hot! Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it ? My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand. That any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart! Through the hall of the Buchanans house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door. The masters body! roared the butler into the mouth- piece. Im sorry, madame, but we cant furnish itits far too hot to touch this noon! What he really said was: Yes yes Ill see. He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats. Madame expects you in the salon! he cried, needless- ly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life. The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans. 1 The Great Gatsby We cant move, they said together. Jordans fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine. And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete? I inquired. Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone. Gatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air. The rumor is, whispered Jordan, that thats Toms girl on the telephone. We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with an- noyance. Very well, then, I wont sell you the car at all. Im under no obligations to you at all. And as for your bothering me about it at lunch time I wont stand that at all! Holding down the receiver, said Daisy cynically. No, hes not, I assured her. Its a bona fide deal. I happen to know about it. Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a mo- ment with his thick body, and hurried into the room. Mr. Gatsby! He put out his broad, flat hand with well- concealed dislike. Im glad to see you, sir. Nick. Make us a cold drink, cried Daisy. As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the mouth. You know I love you, she murmured. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 You forget theres a lady present, said Jordan. Daisy looked around doubtfully. You kiss Nick too. What a low, vulgar girl! I dont care! cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guilt- ily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room. Bles-sed pre-cious, she crooned, holding out her arms. Come to your own mother that loves you. The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mothers dress. The Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say How-de-do. Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small re- luctant hand. Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I dont think he had ever really believed in its ex- istence before. I got dressed before luncheon, said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy. Thats because your mother wanted to show you off. Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. You dream, you. You absolute little dream. Yes, admitted the child calmly. Aunt Jordans got on a white dress too. How do you like mothers friends? Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. Do you think theyre pret- ty? Wheres Daddy? 1 The Great Gatsby She doesnt look like her father, explained Daisy. She looks like me. Shes got my hair and shape of the face. Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step for- ward and held out her hand. Come, Pammy. Goodbye, sweetheart! With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurses hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice. Gatsby took up his drink. They certainly look cool, he said, with visible tension. We drank in long greedy swallows. I read somewhere that the suns getting hotter ev- ery year, said Tom genially. It seems that pretty",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,40,"soon the earths going to fall into the sunor wait a minuteits just the oppositethe suns getting colder every year. Come outside, he suggested to Gatsby, Id like you to have a look at the place. I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsbys eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay. Im right across from you. So you are. Our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog days along shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 blessed isles. Theres sport for you, said Tom, nodding. Id like to be out there with him for about an hour. We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too, against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale. Whatll we do with ourselves this afternoon, cried Dai- sy, and the day after that, and the next thirty years? Dont be morbid, Jordan said. Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall. But its so hot, insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, And everythings so confused. Lets all go to town! Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms. Ive heard of making a garage out of a stable, Tom was saying to Gatsby, but Im the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage. Who wants to go to town? demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsbys eyes floated toward her. Ah, she cried, you look so cool. Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the ta- ble. You always look so cool, she repeated. She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then back at Daisy as if he had just rec- ognized her as some one he knew a long time ago. You resemble the advertisement of the man, she went on 1 The Great Gatsby innocently. You know the advertisement of the man All right, broke in Tom quickly, Im perfectly willing to go to town. Come onwere all going to town. He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved. Come on! His temper cracked a little. Whats the mat- ter, anyhow? If were going to town lets start. His hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisys voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive. Are we just going to go? she objected. Like this? Arent we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first? Everybody smoked all through lunch. Oh, lets have fun, she begged him. Its too hot to fuss. He didnt answer. Have it your own way, she said. Come on, Jordan. They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly. Have you got your stables here? asked Gatsby with an effort. About a quarter of a mile down the road. Oh. A pause. I dont see the idea of going to town, broke out Tom sav- agely. Women get these notions in their heads Shall we take anything to drink? called Daisy from an Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 upper window. Ill get some whiskey, answered Tom. He went inside. Gatsby turned to me rigidly: I cant say anything in his house, old sport. Shes got an indiscreet voice, I remarked. Its full of I hesitated. Her voice is full of money, he said suddenly. That was it. Id never understood before. It was full of moneythat was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals song of it. High in a white palace the kings daughter, the golden girl. Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms. Shall we all go in my car? suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. I ought to have left it in the shade. Is it standard shift? demanded Tom. Yes. Well, you take my coup",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,41,"and let me drive your car to town. The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby. I dont think theres much gas, he objected. Plenty of gas, said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a drug store nowadays. A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Dai- 1 The Great Gatsby sy looked at Tom frowning and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsbys face. Come on, Daisy, said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsbys car. Ill take you in this circus wagon. He opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm. You take Nick and Jordan. Well follow you in the cou- p. She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gats- bys car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind. Did you see that? demanded Tom. See what? He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along. You think Im pretty dumb, dont you? he suggested. Perhaps I am, but I have aalmost a second sight, some- times, that tells me what to do. Maybe you dont believe that, but science He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss. Ive made a small investigation of this fellow, he contin- ued. I could have gone deeper if Id known Do you mean youve been to a medium? inquired Jor- dan humorously. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 What? Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. A me- dium? About Gatsby. About Gatsby! No, I havent. I said Id been making a small investigation of his past. And you found he was an Oxford man, said Jordan helpfully. An Oxford man! He was incredulous. Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit. Nevertheless hes an Oxford man. Oxford, New Mexico, snorted Tom contemptuously, or something like that. Listen, Tom. If youre such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch? demanded Jordan crossly. Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were mar- riedGod knows where! We were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it, we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburgs faded eyes came into sight down the road, I re- membered Gatsbys caution about gasoline. Weve got enough to get us to town, said Tom. But theres a garage right here, objected Jordan. I dont want to get stalled in this baking heat. Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilsons sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car. Lets have some gas! cried Tom roughly. What do you think we stopped forto admire the view? 10 The Great Gatsby Im sick, said Wilson without moving. I been sick all day. Whats the matter? Im all run down. Well, shall I help myself? Tom demanded. You sound- ed well enough on the phone. With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green. I didnt mean to interrupt your lunch, he said. But I need money pretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car. How do you like this one? inquired Tom. I bought it last week. Its a nice yellow one, said Wilson, as he strained at the handle. Like to buy it? Big chance, Wilson smiled faintly. No, but I could make some money on the other. What do you want money for, all of a sudden? Ive been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go west. Your wife does! exclaimed Tom, startled. Shes been talking about it for ten years. He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. And now shes going whether she wants to or not. Im going to get her away. The coup flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 What do I owe you? demanded Tom harshly. I just got wised up to something funny the last two days, remarked Wilson. Thats why I want to get away. Thats why I been bothering you about the car. What do I owe you? Dollar twenty. The relentless beating heat",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
the-great-gatsby,42,"was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadnt alighted on Tom. He had discov- ered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour beforeand it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guiltyas if he had just got some poor girl with child. Ill let you have that car, said Tom. Ill send it over to- morrow afternoon. That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away. In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no con- 1 The Great Gatsby sciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing pic- ture. Her expression was curiously familiarit was an expression I had often seen on womens faces but on Myrtle Wilsons face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife. There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coup. Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool, sug- gested Jordan. I love New York on summer afternoons when every ones away. Theres something very sensuous about itoverripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands. The word sensuous had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before he could invent a protest the coup came to a stop and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside. Where are we going? she cried. How about the movies? Its so hot, she complained. You go. Well ride around and meet you after. With an effort her wit rose faintly, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Well meet you on some corner. Ill be the man smoking two cigarettes. We cant argue about it here, Tom said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza. Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever. But they didnt. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel. The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and in- termittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisys suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as a place to have a mint julep. Each of us said over and over that it was a crazy ideawe all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny. The room was large and stifling, and, though it was al- ready four oclock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mir- ror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair. Its a swell suite, whispered Jordan respectfully and ev- ery one laughed. Open another window, commanded Daisy, without 1 The Great Gatsby turning around. There arent any more. Well, wed better telephone",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,43,"for an axe The thing to do is to forget about the heat, said Tom im- patiently. You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it. He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table. Why not let her alone, old sport? remarked Gatsby. Youre the one that wanted to come to town. There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereup- on Jordan whispered Excuse mebut this time no one laughed. Ill pick it up, I offered. Ive got it. Gatsby examined the parted string, mut- tered Hum! in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair. Thats a great expression of yours, isnt it? said Tom sharply. What is? All this old sport business. Whered you pick that up? Now see here, Tom, said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, if youre going to make personal remarks I wont stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep. As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat ex- ploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohns Wedding March from the ball- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 room below. Imagine marrying anybody in this heat! cried Jordan dismally. StillI was married in the middle of June, Daisy re- membered, Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom? Biloxi, he answered shortly. A man named Biloxi. Blocks Biloxi, and he made box- esthats a factand he was from Biloxi, Tennessee. They carried him into my house, appended Jordan, because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died. After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, There wasnt any connection. I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis, I re- marked. That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminum putter that I use today. The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by in- termittent cries of Yeaeaea! and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began. Were getting old, said Daisy. If we were young wed rise and dance. Remember Biloxi, Jordan warned her. Whered you know him, Tom? Biloxi? He concentrated with an effort. I didnt know 1 The Great Gatsby him. He was a friend of Daisys. He was not, she denied. Id never seen him before. He came down in the private car. Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Lou- isville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him. Jordan smiled. He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale. Tom and I looked at each other blankly. BilOxi? First place, we didnt have any president Gatsbys foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly. By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand youre an Oxford man. Not exactly. Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford. YesI went there. A pause. Then Toms voice, incredulous and insulting: You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven. Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his Thank you and the soft closing of the door. This tremen- dous detail was to be cleared up at last. I told you I went there, said Gatsby. I heard you, but Id like to know when. It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Thats why I cant really call myself an Oxford man. Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby. It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice, he continued. We could go to any of the universities in England or France. I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that Id experi- enced before. Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table. Open the whiskey, Tom, she ordered. And Ill make you a mint julep. Then you wont seem so stupid to yourself. Look at the mint! Wait a minute, snapped Tom, I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question. Go on, Gatsby said politely. What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow? They were out in the open at",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
the-great-gatsby,44,"last and Gatsby was con- tent. He isnt causing a row. Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. Youre causing a row. Please have a little self control. Self control! repeated Tom incredulously. I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if thats the idea you can count me out. Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next theyll throw every- thing overboard and have intermarriage between black and 1 The Great Gatsby white. Flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization. Were all white here, murmured Jordan. I know Im not very popular. I dont give big parties. I suppose youve got to make your house into a pigsty in or- der to have any friendsin the modern world. Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from liber- tine to prig was so complete. Ive got something to tell YOU, old sport, began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention. Please dont! she interrupted helplessly. Please lets all go home. Why dont we all go home? Thats a good idea. I got up. Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink. I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me. Your wife doesnt love you, said Gatsby. Shes never loved you. She loves me. You must be crazy! exclaimed Tom automatically. Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement. She never loved you, do you hear? he cried. She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of wait- ing for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me! At this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gats- by insisted with competitive firmness that we remainas though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emo- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 tions. Sit down Daisy. Toms voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. Whats been going on? I want to hear all about it. I told you whats been going on, said Gatsby. Going on for five yearsand you didnt know. Tom turned to Daisy sharply. Youve been seeing this fellow for five years? Not seeing, said Gatsby. No, we couldnt meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didnt know. I used to laugh sometimesbut there was no laugh- ter in his eyes, to think that you didnt know. Ohthats all. Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair. Youre crazy! he exploded. I cant speak about what happened five years ago, because I didnt know Daisy then and Ill be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of thats a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now. No, said Gatsby, shaking his head. She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesnt know what shes do- ing. He nodded sagely. And whats more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of my- self, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time. Youre revolting, said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrill- 10 The Great Gatsby ing scorn: Do you know why we left Chicago? Im surprised that they didnt treat you to the story of that little spree. Gatsby walked over and stood beside her. Daisy, thats all over now, he said earnestly. It doesnt matter any more. Just tell him the truththat you never loved himand its all wiped out forever. She looked at him blindly. Why,how could I love himpossibly? You never loved him. She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was do- ingand as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late. I never loved him, she said, with perceptible reluc- tance. Not at Kapiolani? demanded Tom suddenly. No. From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air. Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry? There was a husky tenderness in his tone. Daisy? Please dont. Her",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
the-great-gatsby,45,"voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. There, Jay, she said but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet. Oh, you want too much! she cried to Gatsby. I love you nowisnt that enough? I cant help whats past. She began Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 to sob helplessly. I did love him oncebut I loved you too. Gatsbys eyes opened and closed. You loved me TOO? he repeated. Even thats a lie, said Tom savagely. She didnt know you were alive. Why,therere things between Daisy and me that youll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget. The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby. I want to speak to Daisy alone, he insisted. Shes all ex- cited now Even alone I cant say I never loved Tom, she admitted in a pitiful voice. It wouldnt be true. Of course it wouldnt, agreed Tom. She turned to her husband. As if it mattered to you, she said. Of course it matters. Im going to take better care of you from now on. You dont understand, said Gatsby, with a touch of pan- ic. Youre not going to take care of her any more. Im not? Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. Whys that? Daisys leaving you. Nonsense. I am, though, she said with a visible effort. Shes not leaving me! Toms words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. Certainly not for a common swindler whod have to steal the ring he put on her finger. I wont stand this! cried Daisy. Oh, please lets get out. Who are you, anyhow? broke out Tom. Youre one of 1 The Great Gatsby that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiemthat much I happen to know. Ive made a little investigation into your affairsand Ill carry it further tomorrow. You can suit yourself about that, old sport. said Gatsby steadily. I found out what your drug stores were. He turned to us and spoke rapidly. He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drug stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. Thats one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him and I wasnt far wrong. What about it? said Gatsby politely. I guess your friend Walter Chase wasnt too proud to come in on it. And you left him in the lurch, didnt you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of YOU. He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport. Dont you call me old sport! cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth. That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsbys face. That drug store business was just small change, con- tinued Tom slowly, but youve got something on now that Walters afraid to tell me about. I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 chin. Then I turned back to Gatsbyand was startled at his expression. He lookedand this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his gardenas if he had killed a man. For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way. It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, deny- ing everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling un- happily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room. The voice begged again to go. PLEASE, Tom! I cant stand this any more. Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, what- ever courage she had had, were definitely gone. You two start on home, Daisy, said Tom. In Mr. Gats- bys car. She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn. Go on. He wont annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over. They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made ac- cidental, isolated, like ghosts even from our pity. After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the un- opened bottle of whiskey in",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
the-great-gatsby,46,"the towel. Want any of this stuff? Jordan? Nick? I didnt answer. 1 The Great Gatsby Nick? He asked again. What? Want any? No I just remembered that todays my birthday. I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menac- ing road of a new decade. It was seven oclock when we got into the coup with him and started for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exult- ing and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind. Thirtythe promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thin- ning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside me who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coats shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand. So we drove on toward death through the cooling twi- light. The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint be- side the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and found George Wilson sick in his officereally sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed but Wilson re- fused, saying that hed miss a lot of business if he did. While Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead. Ive got my wife locked in up there, explained Wilson calmly. Shes going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then were going to move away. Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasnt working he sat on a chair in the door- way and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colorless way. He was his wifes man and not his own. So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had hap- pened, but Wilson wouldnt say a wordinstead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what hed been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didnt. He supposed he forgot to, thats all. When he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilsons voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage. Beat me! he heard her cry. Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward! A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting; before he could move from his door the business was over. 1 The Great Gatsby The death car as the newspapers called it, didnt stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasnt even sure of its colorhe told the first po- liceman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark blood with the dust. Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long. We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away. Wreck! said Tom. Thats good. Wilsonll have a little business at last. He slowed down, but still without any intention of stop- ping until, as we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes. Well take a look, he said doubtfully, just a look. I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which is- sued",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
the-great-gatsby,47,"incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coup and walked toward the door resolved it- self into the words Oh, my God! uttered over and over in Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 a gasping moan. Theres some bad trouble here, said Tom excitedly. He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through. The circle closed up again with a running murmur of ex- postulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals disarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside. Myrtle Wilsons body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a work table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I couldnt find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garagethen I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, sway- ing back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoul- der, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out inces- santly his high horrible call. O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga- od! 1 The Great Gatsby Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman. M-a-v the policeman was saying, o No,r corrected the man, M-a-v-r-o Listen to me! muttered Tom fiercely. r said the policeman, o g g He looked up as Toms broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder. What you want, fella? What happenedthats what I want to know! Auto hit her. Insantly killed. Instantly killed, repeated Tom, staring. She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didnt even stopus car. There was two cars, said Michaelis, one comin, one goin, see? Going where? asked the policeman keenly. One goin each way. Well, she His hand rose toward the blankets but stopped half way and fell to his side, she ran out there an the one comin from NYork knock right into her goin thirty or forty miles an hour. Whats the name of this place here? demanded the of- ficer. Hasnt got any name. A pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near. It was a yellow car, he said, big yellow car. New. See the accident? asked the policeman. No, but the car passed me down the road, going fastern Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 forty. Going fifty, sixty. Come here and lets have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name. Some words of this conversation must have reached Wil- son swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries. You dont have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was! Watching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms. Youve got to pull yourself together, he said with sooth- ing gruffness. Wilsons eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright. Listen, said Tom, shaking him a little. I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coup weve been talking about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasnt mine, do you hear? I havent seen it all af- ternoon. Only the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes. Whats all that? he demanded. Im a friend of his. Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilsons body. He says he knows the car that did it. It was a yellow car. 10 The Great Gatsby Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspi- ciously at Tom. And what colors your car? Its",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no
the-great-gatsby,48,"a blue car, a coup. Weve come straight from New York, I said. Some one who had been driving a little behind us con- firmed this and the policeman turned away. Now, if youll let me have that name again correct Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair and came back. If somebodyll come here and sit with him! he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered Lets get out. Self consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, pass- ing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago. Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bendthen his foot came down hard and the coup raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face. The God Damn coward! he whimpered. He didnt even stop his car. The Buchanans house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two win- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 dows bloomed with light among the vines. Daisys home, he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly. I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. Theres nothing we can do tonight. A change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phras- es. Ill telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while youre waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supperif you want any. He opened the door. Come in. No thanks. But Id be glad if youd order me the taxi. Ill wait outside. Jordan put her hand on my arm. Wont you come in, Nick? No thanks. I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more. Its only half past nine, she said. Id be damned if Id go in; Id had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butlers voice call- ing a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate. 1 The Great Gatsby I hadnt gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit un- der the moon. What are you doing? I inquired. Just standing here, old sport. Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldnt have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of Wolf- shiems people, behind him in the dark shrubbery. Did you see any trouble on the road? he asked after a minute. Yes. He hesitated. Was she killed? Yes. I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. Its better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well. He spoke as if Daisys reaction was the only thing that mattered. I got to West Egg by a side road, he went on, and left the car in my garage. I dont think anybody saw us but of course I cant be sure. I disliked him so much by this time that I didnt find it necessary to tell him he was wrong. Who was the woman? he inquired. Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen? Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Well, I tried to swing the wheel He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth. Was Daisy driving? Yes, he said after a moment, but of course Ill say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to driveand this woman rushed out at us just",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,49,"as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the wom- an toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shockit must have killed her instantly. It ripped her open Dont tell me, old sport. He winced. AnyhowDaisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldnt so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on. Shell be all right tomorrow, he said presently. Im just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. Shes locked herself into her room and if he tries any brutality shes going to turn the light out and on again. He wont touch her, I said. Hes not thinking about her. I dont trust him, old sport. How long are you going to wait? All night if necessary. Anyhow till they all go to bed. A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found 1 The Great Gatsby out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in ithe might think anything. I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisys room on the second floor. You wait here, I said. Ill see if theres any sign of a com- motion. I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The draw- ing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn but I found a rift at the sill. Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement. They werent happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the aleand yet they werent unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together. As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was wait- ing where I had left him in the drive. Is it all quiet up there? he asked anxiously. Yes, its all quiet. I hesitated. Youd better come home Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 and get some sleep. He shook his head. I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport. He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlightwatching over noth- ing. 1 The Great Gatsby Chapter 8 I couldnt sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning in- cessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsbys drive and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dressI felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning would be too late. Crossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep. Nothing happened, he said wanly. I waited, and about four oclock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light. His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cig- arettes. We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switchesonce I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadnt been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside.

the-great-gatsby,50,"darkness. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 You ought to go away, I said. Its pretty certain theyll trace your car. Go away NOW, old sport? Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal. He wouldnt consider it. He couldnt possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I couldnt bear to shake him free. It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Codytold it to me because Jay Gatsby had broken up like glass against Toms hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy. She was the first nice girl he had ever known. In vari- ous unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed himhe had never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived thereit was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this years shining motor cars and of danc- es whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisyit increased her 1 The Great Gatsby value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions. But he knew that he was in Daisys house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gats- by, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand. He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretenses. I dont mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as herselfthat he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of fact he had no such facilitieshe had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world. But he didnt despise himself and it didnt turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and gobut now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didnt realize just how extraordinary a nice girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsbynothing. He felt married to her, that was all. When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 was breathless, who was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor. I cant describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that shed throw me over, but she didnt, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her. Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didnt care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do? On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in his",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,51,"arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coats shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep. He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain 10 The Great Gatsby before he went to the front and following the Argonne bat- tles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine guns. After the Armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried nowthere was a quality of nervous despair in Daisys letters. She didnt see why he couldnt come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his pres- ence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all. For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the sax- ophones wailed the hopeless comment of the Beale Street Blues while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose pet- als blown by the sad horns around the floor. Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately and the decision must be made by some forceof love, of money, of unquestionable practicalitythat was close at Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 hand. That force took shape in the middle of spring with the ar- rival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford. It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about open- ing the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning, gold turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool lovely day. I dont think she ever loved him. Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened herthat made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying. He sat down gloomily. Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were first marriedand loved me more even then, do you see? Suddenly he came out with a curious remark: In any case, he said, it was just personal. What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldnt be measured? He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irre- 1 The Great Gatsby sistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their foot- steps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driv- en in her white car. Just as Daisys house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty. He left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found herthat he was leaving her behind. The day- coachhe was penniless nowwas hot. He went out to the open vestibule and",no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes
the-great-gatsby,52,"sat down on a folding-chair, and the sta- tion slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street. The track curved and now it was going away from the sun which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in bene- diction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever. It was nine oclock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one of Gatsbys former servants, came to the foot of the steps. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Im going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leavesll start falling pretty soon and then theres always trouble with the pipes. Dont do it today, Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically. You know, old sport, Ive never used that pool all summer? I looked at my watch and stood up. Twelve minutes to my train. I didnt want to go to the city. I wasnt worth a decent stroke of work but it was more than thatI didnt want to leave Gatsby. I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away. Ill call you up, I said finally. Do, old sport. Ill call you about noon. We walked slowly down the steps. I suppose Daisyll call too. He looked at me anxiously as if he hoped Id corroborate this. I suppose so. Wellgoodbye. We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around. Theyre a rotten crowd, I shouted across the lawn. Youre worth the whole damn bunch put together. Ive always been glad I said that. It was the only compli- ment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if wed been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. His gor- 1 The Great Gatsby geous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the white steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruptionand he had stood on those steps, conceal- ing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye. I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thank- ing him for thatI and the others. Goodbye, I called. I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby. Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any oth- er way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry. Ive left Daisys house, she said. Im at Hempstead and Im going down to Southampton this afternoon. Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisys house, but the act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid. You werent so nice to me last night. How could it have mattered then? Silence for a moment. Then HoweverI want to see you. I want to see you too. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Suppose I dont go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon? NoI dont think this afternoon. Very well. Its impossible this afternoon. Various We talked like that for a while and then abruptly we werent talking any longer. I dont know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I didnt care. I couldnt have talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never talked to her again in this world. I called Gatsbys house a",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,53,"few minutes later, but the line was busy. I tried four times; finally an exasperated cen- tral told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my time-table I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon. When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car. I sup- pose thered be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilsons tragic achievement was forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what hap- pened at the garage after we left there the night before. They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have broken her rule against drinking that night for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flush- 1 The Great Gatsby ing. When they convinced her of this she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of the affair. Some- one kind or curious took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sisters body. Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it. Finally someone said it was a shame and closed the door. Michaelis and several other men were with himfirst four or five men, later two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last strang- er to wait there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee. After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn. About three oclock the quality of Wilsons incoherent muttering changedhe grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen. But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry Oh, my God! again in his groaning voice. Mi- chaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him. How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit still a minute and answer my question. How long have you been married? Twelve years. Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit stillI Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 asked you a question. Did you ever have any children? The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadnt stopped a few hours before. He didnt like to go into the ga- rage because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the of- ficehe knew every object in it before morningand from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet. Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you havent been there for a long time? May- be I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see? Dont belong to any. You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to church once. Didnt you get mar- ried in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. Didnt you get married in a church? That was a long time ago. The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking for a moment he was silent. Then the same half knowing, half bewildered look came back into his faded eyes. Look in the drawer there, he said, pointing at the desk. Which drawer? That drawerthat one. Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver. It was apparently new. 1 The Great Gatsby This? he inquired, holding it up. Wilson stared and nodded. I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it but I knew it was something funny. You mean your wife bought it? She had it wrapped in tissue paper",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,54,"on her bureau. Michaelis didnt see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying Oh, my God! again in a whisperhis comforter left several explanations in the air. Then he killed her, said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly. Who did? I have a way of finding out. Youre morbid, George, said his friend. This has been a strain to you and you dont know what youre saying. Youd better try and sit quiet till morning. He murdered her. It was an accident, George. Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior Hm! I know, he said definitely, Im one of these trusting fel- las and I dont think any harm to NObody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldnt stop. Michaelis had seen this too but it hadnt occurred to him that there was any special significance in it. He believed that Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car. How could she of been like that? Shes a deep one, said Wilson, as if that answered the question. Ah-h-h He began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand. Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George? This was a forlorn hopehe was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasnt far off. About five oclock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light. Wilsons glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind. I spoke to her, he muttered, after a long silence. I told her she might fool me but she couldnt fool God. I took her to the window With an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it, and I said God knows what youve been doing, ev- erything youve been doing. You may fool me but you cant fool God! Standing behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night. God sees everything, repeated Wilson. 10 The Great Gatsby Thats an advertisement, Michaelis assured him. Some- thing made him turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight. By six oclock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside. It was one of the watch- ers of the night before who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage Wilson was gone. His movementshe was on foot all the timewere af- terward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gads Hill where he bought a sandwich that he didnt eat and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly for he didnt reach Gads Hill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his timethere were boys who had seen a man acting sort of crazy and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he had a way of finding out, supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forwardand perhaps he had an easier, surer way of find- ing out what he wanted to know. By half past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to Gatsbys house. So by that time he knew Gatsbys name. At two oclock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
the-great-gatsby,55,"the pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasnt to be taken out under any circumstancesand this was strange because the front right fender needed repair. Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees. No telephone message arrived but the butler went with- out his sleep and waited for it until four oclockuntil long after there was any one to give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didnt believe it would come and per- haps he no longer cared. If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees. The chauffeurhe was one of Wolfshiems protgs heard the shotsafterward he could only say that he hadnt thought anything much about them. I drove from the sta- tion directly to Gatsbys house and my rushing anxiously 1 The Great Gatsby up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any one. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hur- ried down to the pool. There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugat- ed the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle in the water. It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilsons body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Chapter 9 After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of po- lice and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsbys front door. A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression mad man as he bent over Wilsons body that afternoon, and the adventitious author- ity of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning. Most of those reports were a nightmaregrotesque, cir- cumstantial, eager and untrue. When Michaeliss testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilsons suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinadebut Catherine, who might have said anything, didnt say a word. She showed a surprising amount of char- acter about it toolooked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more 1 The Great Gatsby than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man deranged by grief in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And it rested there. But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on Gatsbys side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didnt move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, be- cause no one else was interestedinterested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which every one has some",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
the-great-gatsby,56,"vague right at the end. I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them. Left no address? No. Say when theyd be back? No. Any idea where they are? How I could reach them? I dont know. Cant say. I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him: Ill get somebody for you, Gatsby. Dont worry. Just trust me and Ill get some- body for you Meyer Wolfshiems name wasnt in the phone book. The butler gave me his office address on Broadway and I called Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone. Will you ring again? Ive rung them three times. Its very important. Sorry. Im afraid no ones there. I went back to the drawing room and thought for an in- stant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But as they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued in my brain. Look here, old sport, youve got to get somebody for me. Youve got to try hard. I cant go through this alone. Some one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his deskhed never told me definitely that his par- ents were dead. But there was nothingonly the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall. Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed super- fluous when I wrote it. I was sure hed start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure thered be a wire from Daisy before noonbut neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived, no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiems answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful soli- darity between Gatsby and me against them all. 1 The Great Gatsby Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out. Yours MEYER WOLFSHIEM and then hasty addenda beneath: truly Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all. When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a mans voice, very thin and far away. This is Slagle speaking.... Yes? The name was unfamiliar. Hell of a note, isnt it? Get my wire? There havent been any wires. Young Parkes in trouble, he said rapidly. They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving em the numbers just five minutes before. What dyou know about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 Hello! I interrupted breathlessly. Look herethis isnt Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsbys dead. There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation then a quick squawk as the connection was broken. I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to post- pone the funeral until he came. It was Gatsbys father, a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the point of collapse so I took him into the music room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldnt eat and",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,57,"the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand. I saw it in the Chicago newspaper, he said. It was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started right away. I didnt know how to reach you. His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room. It was a mad man, he said. He must have been mad. Wouldnt you like some coffee? I urged him. I dont want anything. Im all right now, Mr. Carraway. Well, Im all right now. Where have they got Jimmy? 1 The Great Gatsby I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away. After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leak- ing isolated and unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom up- stairs; while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came. I didnt know what youd want, Mr. Gatsby Gatz is my name. Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body west. He shook his head. Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in the East. Were you a friend of my boys, Mr.? We were close friends. He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man but he had a lot of brain power here. He touched his head impressively and I nodded. If hed of lived hed of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill. Hed of helped build up the country. Thats true, I said, uncomfortably. He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 from the bed, and lay down stifflywas instantly asleep. That night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know who I was before he would give his name. This is Mr. Carraway, I said. Oh He sounded relieved. This is Klipspringer. I was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend at Gatsbys grave. I didnt want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd so Id been calling up a few people myself. They were hard to find. The funerals tomorrow, I said. Three oclock, here at the house. I wish youd tell anybody whod be interested. Oh, I will, he broke out hastily. Of course Im not likely to see anybody, but if I do. His tone made me suspicious. Of course youll be there yourself. Well, Ill certainly try. What I called up about is Wait a minute, I interrupted. How about saying youll come? Well, the fact isthe truth of the matter is that Im stay- ing with some people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow. In fact theres a sort of picnic or something. Of course Ill do my very best to get away. I ejaculated an unrestrained Huh! and he must have heard me for he went on nervously: What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if itd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see theyre tennis shoes and Im sort of help- 10 The Great Gatsby less without them. My address is care of B. F. I didnt hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver. After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsbyone gentle- man to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the cour- age of Gatsbys liquor and I should have known better than to call him. The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldnt seem to reach him any other way. The door that I pushed open on the advice of an eleva- tor boy was marked The Swastika Holding Company and at first there didnt seem to be any one inside. But when Id shouted Hello several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,58,"with black hostile eyes. Nobodys in, she said. Mr. Wolfshiems gone to Chica- go. The first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to whistle The Rosary, tunelessly, inside. Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him. I cant get him back from Chicago, can I? At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiems called Stella! from the other side of the door. Leave your name on the desk, she said quickly. Ill give it to him when he gets back. But I know hes there. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips. You young men think you can force your way in here any time, she scolded. Were getting sickantired of it. When I say hes in Chicago, hes in ChiCAgo. I mentioned Gatsby. Ohh! She looked at me over again. Will you just what was your name? She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood sol- emnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar. My memory goes back to when I first met him, he said. A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldnt buy some reg- ular clothes. First time I saw him was when he come into Winebrenners poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. He hadnt eat anything for a couple of days. Come on have some lunch with me, I sid. He ate more than four dollars worth of food in half an hour. Did you start him in business? I inquired. Start him! I made him. Oh. I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join up in the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did 1 The Great Gatsby some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything He held up two bulbous fin- gers always together. I wondered if this partnership had included the Worlds Series transaction in 1919. Now hes dead, I said after a moment. You were his closest friend, so I know youll want to come to his funeral this afternoon. Id like to come. Well, come then. The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears. I cant do itI cant get mixed up in it, he said. Theres nothing to get mixed up in. Its all over now. When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was differentif a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think thats sentimental but I mean itto the bitter end. I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up. Are you a college man? he inquired suddenly. For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a gon- negtion but he only nodded and shook my hand. Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead, he suggested. After that my own rule is to let everything alone. When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 went next door and found Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his son and in his sons possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me. Jimmy sent me this picture. He took out his wallet with trembling fingers. Look there. It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. Look there! and then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself. Jimmy sent it to me. I think its a very pretty picture. It shows up well. Very well. Had you seen him lately? He come out to see me two years ago and",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
the-great-gatsby,59,"bought me the house I live in now. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me. He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he re- turned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy. Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you. He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHED- ULE, and the date September 12th, 1906.

He was always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once and I beat him for it. He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me. I think he rather ex- pected me to copy down the list for my own use. A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did Gatsbys father. And as the time passed Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way. The minister glanced several times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour. But it wasnt any use. Nobody came. About five oclock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gatefirst a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in Gatsbys station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the sog- gy ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsbys books in the library one night three months before. Id never seen him since then. I dont know how he knew about the funeral or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsbys grave. I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too far away and I could only remember, with- out resentment, that Daisy hadnt sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on, and then the owl-eyed man said Amen to that, in a brave voice. We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-Eyes spoke to me by the gate. I couldnt get to the house, he remarked. 1 The Great Gatsby Neither could anybody else. Go on! He started. Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds. He took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in. The poor son-of-a-bitch, he said. One of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six oclock of a December evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into their own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or Thats and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
the-great-gatsby,60,"and the matchings of invitations: Are you going to the Ordways? the Herseys? the Schultzes? and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate. When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again. Thats my middle westnot the wheat or the prairies or Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 the lost Swede towns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from grow- ing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a familys name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after allTom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life. Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very oldeven then it had always for me a quality of distor- tion. West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a housethe wrong house. But no one knows the womans name, and no one cares. After Gatsbys death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and 1 The Great Gatsby the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home. There was one thing to be done before I left, an awk- ward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened af- terward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair. She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasnt making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye. Nevertheless you did throw me over, said Jordan sud- denly. You threw me over on the telephone. I dont give a damn about you now but it was a new experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while. We shook hands. Oh, and do you remember she added, a conver- sation we had once about driving a car? Whynot exactly. You said a bad driver was only safe until she met an- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1 other bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didnt I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride. Im thirty, I said. Im five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor. She didnt answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
the-great-gatsby,61,"I turned away. One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out his hand. Whats the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me? Yes. You know what I think of you. Youre crazy, Nick, he said quickly. Crazy as hell. I dont know whats the matter with you. Tom, I inquired, what did you say to Wilson that af- ternoon? He stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm. I told him the truth, he said. He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we werent in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was 10 The Great Gatsby crazy enough to kill me if I hadnt told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house He broke off defiantly. What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisys but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like youd run over a dog and never even stopped his car. There was nothing I could say, except the one unutter- able fact that it wasnt true. And if you think I didnt have my share of suffering look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful I couldnt forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisythey smashed up things and creatures and then re- treated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other peo- ple clean up the mess they had made. I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklaceor perhaps only a pair of cuff buttonsrid of my provincial squea- mishness forever. Gatsbys house was still empty when I leftthe grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi driv- ers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11 it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didnt want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train. I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didnt investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didnt know that the party was over. On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand. Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors eyesa fresh, green breast of the new world.

If he did, he would have known that trouble was brewing from Puget Sound to San Diego. Not only for himself, but for every dog that was strong of muscle with warm, long hair. Men in the Arctic had found a yellow metal that was worth a lot of money. They had found gold. Steamships rushed thousands of men into the Northland. These men wanted dogsheavy dogs with strong muscles to work. They needed dogs with furry coats to protect them from the frost. Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley in California. Judge Millers place, as it was called, stood back from the road. 4 It was half hidden among the trees. If you looked closely, you could catch a glimpse of the porch that ran around its four sides. It sat upon wide-spreading lawns adorned with tall trees. The back of the property was even bigger than the front. There were great stables, rows of vine- covered servants cottages, and an array of outhouses. Long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches dotted the land. There was a pumping plant for the well and a big cement tank. It was in this tank that the Miller boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon. Buck ruled over all of it. He had been born here, and he had lived here for all four years of his life. There were other dogs, of course. But they didnt count. They came and went. Some lived in the kennels and others, like Toots, the Japanese pug, and Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, stayed indoors. They rarely put a paw down on the ground. 5 On the other hand, there were scores of fox terriers who yelped at Toots and Ysabel whenever",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),1,"they poked their eyes up at the window. The house dogs were protected by the housemaids, who were armed with brooms and mops. But Buck was neither a house dog nor a kennel dog. The whole land was his. He plunged into the swimming tank with the Judges sons. He escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judges daughters, on walks. On wintry days, hed lay at the Judges feet before the roaring fire. Hed carry the Judges grandsons on his back or roll them in the grass. He guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain and berry patches. Among the terriers, Buck talked in a bossy manner. He ignored Toots and Ysabel, for he was king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Millers place. Humans included. 6 7 His father, Elmo, was a St. Bernard and had been the Judges constant companion. Buck planned to follow in his footsteps. He wasnt as large as his father. He only weighed 140 pounds thanks to his mother. She had been a Scotch Shepherd dog. Nevertheless, his size was great enough. Buck lived the life of a noble beast and felt, perhaps, too much pride in himself. But he saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house dog. Hunting and outdoor life had kept him trim with hardened muscles. This was the way in which Buck lived in 1897, when the Klondike strike dragged men from all over the world into the frozen North. But Buck did not read the newspapers. Buck also did not know that Manuel, one of the gardeners helpers, was a bad man. Manuel had a love for gambling. But gambling requires money. Money is not something Manuel had a lot of. After supporting his wife and children, there was none left for him. 8 One night, the Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers Association. On this same evening, the boys were busy with their sporting games. As luck would have it, this also happened to be the night of Manuels betrayal. No one saw Manuel and Buck go off through the orchard on what Buck thought was just a stroll. With the exception of a man, no one saw them arrive at the little train station known as College Park. This man talked with Manuel and money exchanged hands. You may want to wrap up the goods before you deliver him, said the stranger. Manuel doubled a piece of rope around Bucks neck under his collar. Twist it and youll choke him plenty. Buck accepted the rope with dignity. He didnt want it around his neck but he had learned to trust men that he knew. But when the rope was placed in the strangers hand, he growled. To his surprise, the rope tightened around his neck and shut off his breath. 9 In a quick rage, Buck ran at the man. The man grabbed him and threw him over on his back. The rope tightened mercilessly and Buck struggled to breathe. His chest heaved with each breath. He had never been treated so poorly! He had never felt such anger. But his strength dimmed as the two men threw him into the baggage car. Buck had traveled enough with the Judge to know he was on a moving train. He opened his eyes and saw a fury of anger as he stared at his kidnapper. The man sprang for his throat but Buck was too quick for him. His jaws closed on the mans hand, and he didnt release it until his breath was choked out of him once again. He has fits, said the man, hiding his mangled hand from the baggage man who came to see about the noise. Im taking him to San Francisco. A doctor there thinks he can cure him. When the train stopped, the man took Buck off the train. They went to a little shed in the 10 back of a saloon on the San Francisco waterfront. All I get is fifty for it, he grumbled. I wouldnt do it again for a thousand cash. His hand was mangled and his left pant leg was ripped from knee to ankle. How much did the other guy get? the saloon keeper asked. A hundred, was the reply. Wouldnt take a penny less to help me. That makes $150, said the saloon keeper. Hes worth it. Buck listened to all this while suffering. He attempted to face them but was thrown down and choked repeatedly until they filed the heavy brass collar off his neck. After the rope was removed, Buck was flung into a crate that looked like a cage. He lay there for the rest of the night nursing his anger and wounded pride. Why did these strange men want him? 11",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),2,"2 Lesson Learned Several times throughout the night Buck sprang to his feet when the door rattled open. He expected to see the Judge or the boys. But each time it was the bulging face of the saloon keeper that peered in over the light of a candle. And each time, the joyful bark that filled Bucks throat was twisted into a savage growl. In the morning, four men entered and picked up the crate. Buck decided they were evil creatures. He growled and snarled at them through the crates bars. The men laughed at him and poked him with sticks. He clamped down on those sticks until he realized that was exactly what they wanted. He lay down and started on a long 12 passage between many hands. He ventured by wagon, truck, ferry steamer, and railway car. For two days and nights, the car was dragged along by other locomotives. Buck was given no food or water. He didnt mind the hunger so much, but the lack of water made his anger reach a frenzy. The bad treatment was only made worse by his thirst. The men didnt care. They teased him. They barked and growled at him, which caused him to react. He was glad for one thing. The rope was off his neck. Now that it was off, he would show them! They would never get another rope around his neck. Ever. He was certain. Buck spent those two days of torment preparing for the first body that approached him. His eyes turned bloodshot and he turned into a raging beast. He was so changed that the Judge himself would not have recognized him. The train messengers breathed a sigh of relief when they unloaded Buck from the train in 13 Seattle. Then, four men carefully carried the crate from the wagon into a small yard. A short man wearing a red sweater came out and signed the receipt book for the driver. That was the man, Buck decided, that would be his next tormentor. He hurled himself savagely against the bars. The man smiled grimly. Then he fetched a hatchet and a club. You aint going to take him out now? the driver asked. Sure, the man replied. He drove the hatchet into the crate. The four men scattered and jumped up on a wall. They prepared to watch the performance from safety. Buck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it. He surged and wrestled with it. Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was there inside, snarling and growling. He was just as anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was to get him out. 14 You red-eyed devil, said the man when he made an opening big enough for Buck to get out. He quickly dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand. Buck truly was a red-eyed devil. He drew himself together, mouth foaming, hair bristling. He had a mad glitter in his eyes. All 140 pounds of him with the memories of the last few nights surged ahead as he launched at the man. In midair, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, Buck received a shock. It brought his teeth together in an agonizing clip. He whirled to the ground. He had never been struck by a club in his life and didnt understand what had happened. With a snarl, Buck was again on his feet. He launched once more into the air. Again, shock came to his body as he was brought crushingly to the ground. He was aware it was the club, but his madness knew no caution. A dozen times he charged and a dozen times the club smashed him down. 15 After one particularly bad blow, Buck crawled to his feet. He was too dazed to lunge again. Blood flowed from his nose, mouth, and ears. His beautiful coat was flecked with blood. Once steady on his feet, the man came toward him and hit him with all his force upon the nose. The agony was greater than any pain Buck had endured up until now. With a roar, Buck hurled himself at the man once more. But the man, shifting the club from right to left, coolly caught him under the jaw and jammed him to the floor. The mans last blow was the worst of all. With it, Buck crumpled and was knocked out. Hes a hard dog to break, said one of the men on the wall. Bucks senses came back to him but not his strength. He lay where he had fallen and watched the man in the red sweater. The man looked over the saloon keepers letter. He answers to the name of Buck. Well, Buck,",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),3,"my boy, weve had our little fight. Best 16 we can do is let it go. You learned your place and I know mine. Be a good dog and well get along well. Be a bad dog and Ill whale the stuffin out of you. As he spoke, he fearlessly patted the head he had just pounded. Buck didnt protest. When the man brought water, Buck drank it eagerly. Later, he ate a slab of meat, chunk by chunk, from the mans hand. 17 Buck was beaten but not broken. He knew he had no chance against this man with the club. He would never forget the lesson. Days passed and other dogs came. He watched as the man repeated the brutal fight with each one. All dogs eventually knew their place except one dog. That dog was killed in the struggle for power. Many men came and left after passing money to the man in the red sweater. Each time money was exchanged, the strangers took a dog or two away with them. They never came back and Buck feared for his future. He was glad each time the strangers passed him over. Yet, his time came. A small man with broken English bought him. For $300, the man called Perrault got Buck and Curly, a good-natured Newfoundland. That was the last Buck saw of the man in the red sweater. Buck and Curly were taken on a ship and turned over to a giant named Francois. 18 Although Buck developed no affection toward Perrault and Francois, he grew to respect them. On the decks of the ship, Buck and Curly joined two other dogs, Dave and Spitz. Dave simply ate and slept and didnt bother much with anyone. Spitz, on the other hand, was always up to something. The first time he met Buck, he smiled in a friendly manner while stealing the food from Bucks bowl. Each day was like the one before except each day grew colder. At last, the propeller grew quiet. The Narwhal was filled with chatter and excitement. Buck knew change was coming. Francois leashed the dogs and brought them on deck. At the first step upon the cold surface, Bucks feet sank into a white, mushy something. He sprang back with a snort. More of the white stuff was falling through the air. He sniffed it curiously. He licked some. It bit like fire and was gone in an instant. This 19 puzzled him. He tried it again with the same result. The men laughed and Buck felt ashamed. This was his first snow and he had no idea what it was. 20 3 The Law of Club and Fang Bucks first day in the North was like a nightmare. Every second was filled with shock and surprise. He had been jerked from civilization and thrust into the wild. It was a confusing and busy place to be. Buck felt his life was at risk. He needed to be alert at all times. For these men and dogs were not proper men and dogs. They were savages. All of them. They knew no law except the law of club and fang. Soon, Buck learned a lesson on how these wolfish creatures fought. Curly, in her friendly way, approached a husky dog the size of a wolf. Without warning, the dog leaped up and sank her teeth into Curlys face. 21 This was the wolfs way of fighting. Strike and leap away. But there was more to it than that. Thirty to forty huskies ran to them and surrounded them in a silent circle. Buck made nothing of the eager way they licked their chops. Curly rushed toward her attacker, who struck again and leaped aside. Curly tumbled off her feet and never again stood. This was what the other huskies waited for. They closed in around her as they snarled and yelped. She was soon buried while screaming in agony beneath their bodies. It was so sudden. Buck stood in shock. In a moment, Spitz ran out and looked as though he had been laughing. Francois, carrying an ax, approached the dogs. Two minutes from the time Curly went down to the time the last dog was clubbed off, she lay there dead, her body torn to pieces. This scene often came back to haunt Buck in his sleep. 22 So that is the way, thought Buck. No fair play. Once down, that was the end of you. Buck would see to it that he never went down. Spitz ran by, mocking him with his tongue out. From that moment on, Buck despised Spitz and felt nothing but hatred for him. Before Buck could recover from Curlys brutal killing, he received another shock. Francois fastened a harness on him. Buck had seen",no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),4,"harnesses fastened to horses at Judge Millers. He knew what would happen next. He was to work. Buck set out to drive Francois on the sled through the forest and returned hauling a load of firewood. His dignity was hurt, but he was too wise to rebel. He did his best and made remarkable progress in a short time. By the time he returned to camp, he knew to stop at ho and rush ahead at mush. That Buck learned quick. He pulled hard and is quick as anything, said Francois to Perrault. 23 By evening, Perrault had returned with three more dogs. Billee was a dog of good nature. His brother, Joe, just wanted to be left alone, much like the third dog brought in, Sol-leks. Buck was happy to go to sleep that night. When he entered the glowing tent for rest, Perrault and Francois cursed and threw cooking utensils at him. He fled to the outside once again. Although he attempted to lie down and 24 sleep, the snow-covered ground drove him shivering to his feet. Miserable, he wandered among the tents. It was no use. One place was as cold as the next. He decided to see where the others had settled down and circled the tent looking for them. Suddenly, the snow gave way and something wiggled beneath his feet. He jumped back frightened at the unknown. But a friendly yelp reassured him, so Buck went to investigate. It was Billie curled up like a ball under the snow. Another lesson. So this is how they do it? Buck selected a spot, dug a hole, and soon the space was heated by his body. He fell asleep quickly, though he wrestled with bad dreams. The next day, three more huskies were added to the team. It wasnt long before they were harnessed and set out swinging up the trail toward Dyea Canyon. Buck was glad to be gone from the camp. Although the work was hard, he didnt hate it 25 at all. He was surprised at how all the dogs came to life once the harness was on them. This was true especially of Dave and Sol-leks. Dave was the wheeler. He was the dog nearest the sled. Buck pulled in front of him and then came Sol-leks. The rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file, to the leader, which was Spitz. Buck had been placed between Dave and Sol-leks for good reason. They were fair teachers and helped Buck learn the ropes. If Buck made a mistake, they saw to it that he didnt make the same mistake again. By the end of the day, Francoiss whip snapped less as the dogs stayed on course and remained tangle free. It had been a hard days run. They went up the canyon, through Sheep Camp, and across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep. Then, they passed over the great Chilcoot Divide, which separates the salt water from the fresh and guards the North. By nightfall, they had made forty miles. 26 When it was time to rest for the evening, the team pulled into a huge camp at the head of Lake Bennett. Thousands of gold seekers were building boats and preparing for the breakup of the ice in the spring. The team made poorer time from that day on. It was hard work, and Buck was exhausted at the end of each day. Perrault and Francois would pitch camp after dark and eat their bits of fish. Then the dogs would crawl into snowy holes. Buck was starving, and the salmon he got each night didnt fill him. At first, he was a dainty eater. But his mates would rob him of his food before he had the chance to finish it. He couldnt defend it. While hed try to fend off one or two dogs, more would be waiting to have his fish disappear down their throats. He learned yet another lesson. He must eat as fast as his peers. He also learned to take what didnt belong to him. After seeing Pike, one of 27 the new dogs, steal bacon from Perraults plate, Buck learned to do the same. This first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland environment. He was able to adapt and change to the conditions around him. If he didnt adjust his ways, he knew it would mean certain death. His high morals were compromised. In the Southland, Buck was taught to respect private property and personal feelings under the laws of love. But under the law of club and fang, those who attempted to follow those laws would likely die. The man in the red sweater had taught him that. Buck had reasoned that this was what he",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),5,"now must do to survive. He never again ran from a fight. He didnt steal for the joy in it but because his stomach told him to. He didnt rob openly. Instead, he was sly about it out of respect for club and fang. In short, the way he acted was because it was easier to do these things than to not do them. 28 The change in Buck happened quickly. His muscles became hard as iron. He didnt feel ordinary pain. He could eat anything no matter how loathsome it appeared. His senses of sight and smell became keen. His hearing developed so that he could hear the faintest sound in his sleep and know if his life was at risk. When ice collected between his toes, he learned to bite it out with his teeth. When thirsty, he broke the ice over the water hole by first standing on his hind legs. Then, with all his strength, he smashed down on the ice with his front legs. Bucks instincts, long dead, were awakened once again. The domesticated generations fell from him. It was easy for him to learn to fight with the quick wolf snap. His ancestors had fought this way and now it was time for him to do the same. These ways came back to him as if they had never been completely lost. They stirred the old life within him. 29 30 On cold nights, Buck pointed his nose at a star and howled like a wolf. Those nights it was as if his ancestors were pointing their noses at a star and howling down through the centuries through him. Buck returned to the way nature meant him to be. All because a man had found yellow metal in the North and Manuel was a gardeners helper whose wages did not meet his gambling needs. 31 4 The Invaders Although Buck gained confidence, he didnt want the others to know. Not only did he not pick fights with other dogs, but he avoided them whenever possible. He was a patient, smart dog. Although he didnt like Spitz, he worked hard to keep that a secret from Spitz. On the other hand, Spitz never backed away. His teeth were always ready to bite Buck. He went out of his way to bully Buck and start a fight with him. Both knew the fight would end only in death of one or the other. At the end of a certain day, they made camp on the shore of Lake LeBarge. Driving snow and darkness forced them to grope for their campsite. The back of their camp was a wall, 32 which forced them to make campfire on the edge of the lake itself. The fire soon thawed down through the ice itself, leaving them in complete darkness to eat. Buck made his nest under the sheltering rock. It was so snug and warm that he hated to leave it to fetch the food from Francoiss hand. After eating, Buck returned to his sleeping spot only to find Spitz had settled there. Until now, Buck had avoided trouble with his enemy. But this was too much. The beast in Buck roared. He sprang upon Spitz with a fury that surprised them both. Francois was surprised, too. He went to settle the dogs down as they both circled each other, waiting for an opportunity to strike. Then the unexpected happened. Out of the darkness came a cry from Perrault. The sound of a club pounding an animal could be heard. The camp came alive with the shadows of sulking forms. 33 Starving huskies were attacking! There were four or five in all. Lured by the smell of food, they had crept in while Spitz and Buck fought. The two men sprang into action. But the dogs, showing their teeth, were overcome with hunger and crazed. Perrault attacked the one with his head buried in the grub box. The box overturned and it was clear the animal was hurt, but he didnt stop scrambling for the bacon and bread on the ground. Clubs fell on the wild dogs. They yelped and howled under the blows but struggled madly until every crumb had been found and eaten. Never had Buck seen such dogs! It seemed as though their bones would burst through what skin was left. They were mere skeletons. Although smaller than Buck, their crazed hunger and blazing eyes made them terrifying. There was no opposing them. The sled dogs were swept back against the cliff. Three huskies went for Buck and his head 34 and shoulders were ripped and slashed. Buck fell back as the others did. Pike overcame a husky and Dave and Sol- leks fought bravely by his side. Buck managed to sink his teeth into his",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),6,"enemys throat. Blood sprayed Buck and it caused greater fierceness in him. As he flung himself against another invader, he felt teeth sinking into his own neck. It was Spitz attacking from the side. Perrault and Francois hurried to save their sled dogs. The wild beasts rolled back a bit allowing Buck to run away. Pike and Dave followed as did the rest of the team. Later the nine-dog team gathered together and sought shelter in the forest. They were a sorry bunch. All were wounded in four or five places. Dolly, the last dog to join the team, had a severe throat injury. Joe had lost an eye. Billies ear was chewed and shredded. Despite their injuries, they managed to limp back to camp the next day. 35 The invaders were nowhere to be seen. Only Perrault and Francois were left. Both men were miserable. Every last bit of food was stolen from them. Nothing had escaped the wild beasts. They had even eaten a pair of Perraults moose-hide moccasins and two feet from the end of Francoiss whip. Francois looked the dogs up and down. Maybe some of those bites will make mad dogs out of ours. Perrault shook his head. Theyll be fine. They have to be fine. With 400 miles still ahead, they couldnt afford to have madness break out among the dogs. Two hours later, the harness was fixed and the wounded dogs took their places. Once again, they were under way. The hardest part of the trail was before them. 36 5 A Fight to the End The Thirty Mile River was wide open. Its wild water defied the frost. Six days were required to cover the thirty terrible miles. Each foot traveled risked the life of man and dog. Perrault broke through the ice at least a dozen times only to be saved by the long pole he carried. Each time he fell through, theyd have to stop to dry his clothes by a fire. Doing all this at nearly fifty below zero was an almost impossible task. Nothing scared Perrault, which is why he was chosen by the government as a courier. He took great risks each time he led the team over the thin parts of the ice. If a dog fell through, he wouldnt hesitate to rescue it. 37 Another time, Spitz broke through and dragged the whole team up to Buck in with him. Buck strained backward with all his might. Behind Buck, Dave did the same. The rim ice broke behind Francois and there was no way to escape but up a cliff. Perrault scaled the cliff and, by some miracle, all dogs were hoisted one by one to the crest. By nightfall, they had found a spot to go back down to the rivers edge. The whole day only saw a quarter mile gain. By the time they made it to good ice, Buck was exhausted. His feet were not as hard as the huskies feet. They had softened in time from the previous generations. Buck limped about each day. Once camp was made, he lay down like a dead dog. It was too painful to move. Francois had to bring food to Buck. Buck couldnt walk to get it. Francois took to rubbing Bucks feet for a half hour each evening after supper. He 38 sacrificed his own moccasins to make four moccasins for Buck. Perrault had a good laugh forgot the one evening when Francois moccasins. Buck lay on his back, four feet waving in the air. He refused to budge without them. Later his feet grew hard on the trail and the worn-out shoes were tossed aside. 39 At the river one morning, Dolly suddenly went mad. She let out a long, heartbreaking wolf howl that spread fear in all the dogs. She sprang straight for Buck. Although Buck had never seen a mad dog, it was quite clear he needed to run away from this horror. He fled as Dolly, frothing and panting, chased him. He ran what seemed like a great distance. Finally, he heard Francois calling him and ran toward him. Francois was ready with ax in hand. As Buck ran past, so did Dolly. As Dolly did, the ax came down upon her head. Francois had no other choice. Buck staggered over to Francoiss sled. Panting and exhausted, he sobbed for breath. This was the opportunity Spitz had longed for. He sprang on Buck and tore into his skin. Francois came to Bucks rescue once more. His lash whipped about and Buck had the satisfaction of seeing Spitz get his worst whipping yet. 40 From then on, it was war between Spitz and Buck. Spitz felt his leadership threatened by Buck. All the other Southland dogs Spitz had known were",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),7,"too weak for the trail. Yet Buck was different. Spitz knew Buck matched him in strength, savagery, and sneaky ways. The clash for leadership couldnt be avoided. All the dogs knew that there would be a fight to see who would lead the team. Buck wanted it. His pride was strong and he knew he had worked hard on the trail. Indeed, Spitz was in charge of the dogs and he felt he worked just as hard. As leader, it was his job to punish those that couldnt keep up. This is why he feared Buck. Buck was strong, and now he challenged Spitzs leadership at every turn. The two began to fight every chance they got. Buck started to cause fights between Spitz and the others only so he could come in and get between them. Buck was smart about it. He would only do it when Francois wasnt around. 41 One day, when chasing a rabbit through the snow, Buck and Spitz came to blows once again. In a flash, Buck knew that the time had come. It would be a fight to the death. As they circled about, they snarled with their ears back, each watched for an advantage. Buck sensed a feeling of familiarity. It was in the white woods, the moonlight, and the thrill of battle. Buck felt this scene had happened before. It was the way it was and the way it should be. Spitz was a practiced fighter. Bitter, but not blind, rage was his. He never rushed until he was prepared to receive a rush. He never attacked until he first defended an attack. In vain, Buck tried to sink his teeth into Spitzs neck. His fangs were met with Spitzs fangs. Lips were cut and blood sprayed. Buck took to rushing, but it didnt work. Each time, Spitz would leap away. 42 Spitz wasnt hurt, yet Buck was bleeding and panting. As Buck panted, Spitz took to rushing. The fight was growing desperate and a wolfish circle had gathered to attack whoever fell first. Buck had something that Spitz didnt imagination. He fought by instinct but could also outsmart his enemy. He rushed Spitz but at the last second, swept low to the snow. Bucks teeth closed on Spitzs left front leg. There was a crunch of breaking bone. Buck repeated his trick, this time breaking the bones of the right front leg. Despite the pain, Spitz struggled madly to keep up. Then he noticed the silent circle, the gleaming eyes, and dangling tongues. He had been a part of these circles many times. However, this time, he was the one the others waited for to fall. There was no hope for Spitz. Buck was unstoppable. He would show no mercy. One 43 last move from Buck was all it took. The circle moved in and Spitz disappeared from view. Buck stood and looked on. He defeated his enemy and proved to be the strongest among them. It felt good. 44 6 A New Leader The next day, Francois saw Bucks wounds and noticed Spitz was missing. Look here, Perrault. That Spitz is tough. Look at Bucks neck. Perrault looked at the cuts. Buck is stronger. Thats why Spitz isnt here. Francois nodded. Well make good time now. No more Spitz means no more trouble. Francois got up to harness the dogs. Buck trotted to the front where Spitz would have been. Francois, not noticing him, had brought Sol-leks up to the front. Buck sprang on Sol- leks in a fury, driving him back. Go away, Buck, said Francois. Sol-leks is the lead dog now. 45 Francois took Buck by the scruff of his neck and dragged him to the side. When he turned his back, Buck once again went to the front of the line and nudged Sol-leks out of position. Francois was angry. Ill fix you, Buck! He moved forward holding a club. Buck remembered the man in the red sweater. He slowly backed away as he snarled with rage. He never took his eyes off the club. This time, he knew better. When at last they called Buck to take his usual place, Buck refused to come forward. He wanted the leadership. He had earned it and he wouldnt be happy until he got it. Buck darted about the camp, always careful to stay far from the club. For an hour, Perrault and Francois chased Buck. He didnt try to run away. He was letting them know that he would settle for nothing but the position hed earned. Perrault looked at his watch. Were losing time. We should have been on the trail an hour ago. 46 Francois snorted and walked over to Sol-leks. He unfastened the harness and put him back in his old place. Then, he",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),8,"called to Buck. Buck trotted over and swung around into position at the head of the team. His harness was fastened, the sled broke out, and with both men running, they dashed out on to the river trail. In no time, Buck proved to be superior to Spitz. This surprised Francois and Perrault. He 47 immediately worked the dogs who had become lazy under Spitz. Dave and Sol-leks didnt mind the change of leadership. They just cared about the work. Buck had to lick the rest of them into shape. The general tone of the team shaped up immediately. Once again, the dogs worked as one. Soon, two more dogs, Teek and Koona, were added. Buck broke them in with great speed. Perrault and Francois had never witnessed such speed before. Hes worth every penny we paid for him, said Francois. Perrault disagreed. Nah, hes worth more than that. Much, much more. Perrault was especially pleased with the gains his team made each day. The Thirty Mile River, which had taken them ten days to cross on the way in, now took just one day. Amazing! They ran with record speed. Each day for forty days they averaged forty miles. When they finally stopped to rest and 48 brag about their team, the men got orders that would send them on without the dogs. Francois threw his arms around Buck and wept over him. That was the last Buck ever saw of Francois and Perrault. Like other men, they left Bucks life for good. A Scottish man took charge of Buck and his teammates. With a dozen other dog teams by his side, they started back over the trail to Dawson. There was no light running now. Record times would be impossible, for now each day had a heavy load in the sled. This sled was filled with letter upon letter that carried news from the world to the men who searched for gold. Although Buck did not like it, he did his work well. The work was boring. Each day was the same. There was never any change. Buck would wake up as the fires were being built, eat breakfast, and then a man would harness him. All this happened quickly and theyd be on their way before dawn. 49 At night, they would make camp again. While some pitched tents and others started fires, the dogs were fed. The dogs loved this part of the day. Theyd all gather, eat, and then lie around together. During this time, there was lots of fighting. After winning several fights, Buck proved to be the strongest of them all. He was so feared that when he showed his teeth, the others got out of his way. That was the way he liked it. But most of all, Buck loved to lie near the fire and dream of the past. Sometimes he thought of his days at Judge Millers house. He thought fondly of the swimming tank and Ysabel and Toots. But more often, Buck thought about the man in the red sweater, the death of Curly, and his great fight with Spitz. He was not homesick though. Such memories had no power of him. What did have a strange power over him were the instincts he felt in the wild. They 50 were growing stronger as each day passed. They made him feel alive again. It was a hard trip. The heavy work wore the dogs down. They were weak and thin when they arrived in Dawson. Due to the difficult journey, they should have rested a week. Maybe even ten days. However, just two days later, they were off down the Yukon River loaded with letters again. The drivers grumbled. The dogs were exhausted. To make matters worse, it snowed every day. The soft snow meant the dogs had to work harder to pull the sled. As hard as the trip was, the drivers were fair and did their best for the animals. Each night, the dogs were looked after first. They ate before the drivers ate. No man was allowed to sleep until he had looked after the feet of the dogs he drove. Still, the dogs grew weaker. Since the beginning of winter, they had traveled 1,800 miles, dragging sleds the whole 51 distance. Eighteen hundred miles is tough for even the strongest of dogs. Billie cried and whimpered in his sleep each night. Joe was meaner than ever. But it was Dave who suffered most of all. He became angrier and sadder. Once he was fed each night, he didnt get back on his feet until he was harnessed the next morning. He would cry out in pain while running. The driver examined him but couldnt find anything wrong. By the time they reached their next stop,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),9,"Dave was so weak that he fell repeatedly in the harness. The Scot had no choice but to take him out of the team. Sol-leks would now move to his spot. The Scottish man wanted to let Dave rest and have him run free behind the sled. Sick as he was, Dave resented this. He whimpered, grunted, and growled as his harness was unfastened. Seeing Sol-leks in the position he 52 had held and served in for so long broke his heart. He couldnt bear that another dog would be doing his work. When the sled started up again, Dave ran in the snow barking at Sol-leks. He tried pushing him out of the way. The driver tried to keep Dave away from Sol-leks but couldnt. Dave insisted on running in the soft snow where the going was more difficult. He fought hard but finally collapsed. He lay there and howled as the other sleds sped past them. The driver paused for a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind them. When he came back and started the dogs, the dogs ran ahead and then stopped suddenly. Each one looked surprised and confused. The driver was confused and surprised, too. The sled had not moved. The driver called the other men over to see what had happened. Dave had bitten through the harness that connected Sol-leks to the other 53 dogs and the sled. He stood right in front of the sled. Dave pleaded with his eyes to stay there. The driver didnt know what to do. His friends warned him that a dogs heart could break if denied work. They spoke of dogs they knew who had been unharnessed due to age or injury and had died soon after. It was decided that Dave should return to the harness. The men knew he didnt have much time left. They wanted his last days to be spent harnessed and happy. When Dave was put back in with the dogs, he pulled hard though the snow. Yet, he continued to cry out in pain. Several times he fell down and the sled rode over him. He held out until the camp was reached. His driver made a place for him by the fire. When morning came, Dave was too weak to travel. At harness time, he tried to crawl to his driver but couldnt. His strength had left him. 54 The last Buck saw of Dave was as he lay gasping in the snow. But the team could hear his sad howling until it passed beyond the river. 55 7 New Masters Thirty days after they left Dawson, the team arrived in Skaguay. They carried the Salt Water mail. The dogs were in horrible shape. They were worn out and worn down. Bucks weight had gone from 140 to 115 pounds. There wasnt a dog that wasnt footsore and limping. There was no spring or bounce in any of them. Every muscle and every cell was tired. In less than five months they had traveled 2,500 miles. With only five days rest over the last 1,800 miles, they could barely move. When they arrived in Skaguay, they were on their last legs. They could barely pull the sled. 56 The drivers were certain theyd get a long rest. They were wrong. The mail was overflowing and couldnt wait. While many men rushed to search for gold in the Klondike, many wives and children were left behind. That meant mail. Lots of it. The men received their orders: continue on with the mail. They received new dogs to take the place of their tired team. Orders came down that the old team should be sold. The dogs rested for three days. On the fourth, two men bought them, harness and all. The men called each other Charles and Hal. Charles was a middle-aged man and had weak, watery eyes. His black mustache twisted up at the ends. Hal was about nineteen or twenty and carried a gun and a hunting knife strapped to his belt. Both men looked out of place here and many wondered why they had come. Buck saw the men talking and noticed money pass between them. He knew that the 57 Scottish man and the drivers were passing out of his life, just like Perrault and Francois and the others had done before. When the team arrived at their camp, Buck saw dirty dishes everywhere. The tent was only half stretched. It was a mess. He also saw a woman named Mercedes. She was Charless wife and Hals sister. Buck watched them as the men took down the tent and loaded the sled. It was a chaotic scene. They rolled the tent into a bundle three times as large as it should have",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),10,"been. They packed the tin dishes as they weredirty. The three talked and argued constantly. Mercedes would direct them to put a load on the back of the sled. Once done, shed change her mind and have the men move it to the front. Shed often have them rearrange the load a third time. Three men from a nearby tent came over. They grinned and smirked. 58 59 I wouldnt bring that tent along, said a man. Mercedes screeched. How would I manage without it? Its springtime. The cold weather is behind us, said the man. Mercedes ignored him and directed Hal and Charles to load it on top. Think it will ride? asked another man. Why shouldnt it? demanded Charles. It seems a little top heavy, thats all, said the man. Of course, said the first man, the dogs cant hike all day with that load behind them. Charles grew angry. To prove them wrong, he yelled out, Mush! The dogs rushed forward, strained for a few minutes, and then relaxed. They couldnt move the sled. The lazy dogs! Hal shouted. He raised his whip. Ill show them! Mercedes cried out, Hal! You mustnt! She grabbed hold of the whip. 60 You dont know anything about these dogs, said Hal. I need to whip them to get anything out of them. Thats their way. Theyre weak for water, said one of the men. Tuckered out. They need a rest. Again Hals whip fell on the dogs. Still, after much effort, the sled wouldnt move. Mercedes dropped down on her knees next to Buck. You poor, poor dears. Why dont you pull harder? Then you wouldnt be whipped. Buck didnt like her at all. One of the men who had been clenching his teeth spoke up. Its not that I care what happens to you, but for the sake of those dogs, help them by breaking out the sled. The runners are frozen. Throw your weight against the gee pole, right and left, and break it out. Following this advice, Hal broke out the runners. The overloaded sled forged ahead. Buck and the dogs struggled under Hals mean treatment. A hundred yards ahead, the path turned and sloped toward the main street. Hal 61 didnt know how to keep the top-heavy sled from tipping over. As the dogs ran around the bend, the sled spilled over. Hal cried out for them to stop, but they were filled with rage and continued running. Hal tumbled out of the sled and landed on his shoulder. The dogs dashed up the street, scattering the rest of the load along the way. Some friendly villagers caught the dogs and gathered the scattered belongings. They also advised Hal and Charles, If you expect to reach Dawson, you need half the load and twice the number of dogs you have now. Although the grumpy men didnt want to, they pitched the tent and went through their belongings. Canned goods were thrown away first. Canned foods on a trail? said one man. No wonder youre so top heavy. The men laughed. Blankets were thrown on the ground next. The men chuckled again. Blankets are for hotels! 62 The men urged Charles, Hal, and Mercedes to do away with tents and dishes. Whos going to wash those dishes anyway? they asked. Do you think youre traveling on a fancy train? Mercedes cried when her clothes were dumped. She cried when the men dumped their clothes, too. She pleaded with the men. It didnt help. Finally, she wiped her tears and, in spite, started to throw away what little clothes they actually needed! Although lessened, it was still an incredible load. Charles and Hal bought six dogs that evening. They now had fourteen in all. But not all dogs are made for pulling sleds. These newcomers were weak on the trail even though they had been trained. Buck and the rest of the dogs did not like the new dogs. Buck quickly taught the dogs what they should not do, but he couldnt teach them what they should do. These dogs were frightened of the strange environment and the treatment they received. 63 With fourteen worn-out dogs and lots of trail to cover, the outlook was grim. The two men, however, were cheerful. They were quite proud that they had fourteen dogs. They took great satisfaction in themselves when they noticed that they had more dogs than any other sled on the trail! There was a reason the others did not have fourteen dogs dragging their sleds. A sled could not carry the food fourteen dogs needed. But Charles and Hal did not know this. They had figured everything out on paper. They planned the amount of food they thought theyd need. It all seemed so simple to them.",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),11,"Late the next morning, Buck led the long team up the street. There was nothing lively about them. They were starting out dead tired. Buck had covered this trail four times already. He knew what was ahead and felt bitter and angry. His heart was no longer in his work. None of the dogs hearts was. The new dogs 64 were shy and scared, and the old team had no confidence in their drivers. Buck knew that they could not depend on these three people. They could not do anything and it was obvious that they could not learn. They were lazy and disorganized. It took them half the night to set up camp and half the morning to take it down. Charles and Hal rushed to load the sled so much that theyd often have to stop and rearrange the load. Some days, they never made it out of camp. On most days, they never made ten miles. They were behind schedule. The dog food was running low. When the dogs slowed down, Hal and Charles fed them more. Hal felt they werent eating enough and didnt pay attention to how much food was left for the long journey. Even Mercedes stole fish and fed them when no one was looking. 65 It wasnt food that the dogs needed. They needed rest, for the load sapped every last bit of their energy and strength. When Hal finally realized that the dog food was already half gone so early into the trip, he cut down the rations. At the same time, he tried to increase the miles each day. It was easy to give them less food. However, no one could make them travel faster. 66 Charles, Hal, and Mercedes fought, which often delayed their travels each day. Not only did these people not know how to work dogs, they didnt know how to work themselves. Since the new dogs needed more food than the huskies, Hal and Charles got rid of them one by one. The realities of Arctic travel became too harsh for them. Mercedes no longer cared for any dog. She cared only for herself. No matter how tired she was, she was never too tired to argue. The men lost all patience with Mercedes and with each other. They were sore and stiff. The more their bodies ached, the harsher they treated one another. 67 8 John Thornton Mercedes insisted on riding in the sled at all times. She weighed 120 pounds, and the weight added to the struggles of the dogs. Finally, the dogs fell down and couldnt move another inch. Get off that sled, said Hal. Mercedes wouldnt budge. The dogs cant carry your load,"" complained Charles. Again, Mercedes wouldnt budge. Hal and Charles picked Mercedes up and put her down on the trail. Still, she didnt budge. They decided to teach her a lesson and left her there. Still, she refused to move. 68 Finally, after the men traveled three miles, they turned around, found her, and placed her back on the sled. From this point on, they did nothing but treat each other badly. They treated the dogs even worse. Hal and Charles took to clubbing the dogs and whipping them more frequently. When the food ran out, Hal traded his knife for some frozen meat. It was a poor substitute for food and felt like lead in the dogs stomachs. Through it all, Buck staggered along at the head of the team. He felt as if he were in a nightmare. He pulled when he could. When he couldnt, he fell down and remained there until blows from the whip or club forced him to his feet again. The gloss had gone out of Bucks beautiful coat. His hair was tangled and covered with dried blood. He was so skinny that each rib and bone of his body was outlined through his skin. It was heartbreaking, but Bucks heart was unbreakable. 69 The six other remaining dogs were skeletons like Buck. And like Buck, none had any strength or spark left. The pain of their beatings were dull and distant. It was if they werent even alive. They were simply bags of bones. When the sled stopped, the dogs dropped down in their harnesses like dead dogs. Only when the club fell upon them repeatedly, would they stagger to their feet and move forward. One day, Billie fell and couldnt rise. Koona fell the next day. Both were cut out of their harnesses and left to die. Only five dogs remained to pull the heavy load. Buck still led the team, but he no longer enforced discipline. He was too blind with weakness and only managed to stay on the trail by the dim feel of his feet. Although beautiful spring",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),12,"weather was upon them, the dogs and humans didnt notice. Each day, the sun rose earlier and set later. It was 70 dawn by three in the morning and stayed light until nine at night. The whole day long was a blaze of sunshine. The ghost of winter was awakened. The sap was rising in the pines. The willows were bursting out in young buds. Crickets sang in the night. Creepy, crawling things rustled forth during the day. Squirrels chattered. Bird sang. From every hill came the trickle of running water. All things were thawing, bending, and snapping. The Yukon was straining to break the ice loose. Air holes formed in the frozen ground and thin sections of ice on the rivers fell through. With Mercedes crying, Hal and Charles fighting, and the dogs falling, they staggered into John Thorntons camp. Thorntons camp was located at the mouth of White River. When they stopped, every dog fell down as if dead. 71 Mercedes dried her eyes and looked at Thornton. Charles sat on a log to rest. Hal did all of the talking. Thornton was whittling the last touches on an ax handle he had made from a stick of birch. He whittled and listened. When asked for advice, he gave it knowing none of them would listen. At the last camp, they told us that the ice was breaking in the trail here. The bottom was dropping out of the river and the best thing for us to do would have been to wait, Hal said. But look at us. We made it here to the White River. He sneered. They were right, said Thornton. The bottoms likely to drop out at any moment. Only fools could have made it. You were lucky. Ill tell you the truth. I wouldnt risk my life on that ice for all the gold in Alaska. Thats because youre not a fool, I suppose, said Hal. All the same, were going on to Dawson. He uncoiled his whip. Get up there, Buck. Mush on! 72 Thornton went on whittling. He knew that getting through to one fool was hard enough. But these three fools? Impossible! But Buck and the dogs did not get up. The whip snapped again and finally Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. Teek followed. Joe came next, yelping with pain. Pike made the effort but fell over twice. It wasnt until his third attempt that he stood. Buck made no effort. He lay quietly where he had fallen. The whip bit into his skin over and over again. He didnt whine or struggle. Thorntons eyes moistened. This was the first time Buck had failed. This alone was enough to drive Hal into a rage. He put down his whip and picked up his club. Although Hal pounded the club into him, Buck refused to move. He had the feeling of doom. John Thornton rose and knocked Hal to the ground. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on but stayed on the log. He was too sore and too lazy to move. 73 Thornton stood over Buck too enraged to speak. Finally, he choked out, If you strike that dog again, Ill kill you. Its my dog, Hal replied as he wiped the blood from his mouth. Get out of my way or Ill fix you. Were going to Dawson. Thornton stood between Hal and Buck. He had no intentions of backing away. Back away, 74 warned Thornton. I said Id kill you and I meant it. Leave the dog alone. Hal took out his hunting knife. Mercedes screamed when Thornton knocked it out of his hand with his ax handle. The knife flew to the ground. Thornton picked up the knife and with two strokes, cut Buck out of his harness. Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, he had enough problems with his sister and Charles. He figured that Buck was too close to dying to be of much help anyway. A few minutes later, Hal, Charles, Mercedes, and the dogs pulled out of camp and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head. Pike was leading. Sol-leks was at the wheel and Joe and Teek were between. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was in the sled as usual. Hal guided with the gee pole while Charles stumbled along the rear. As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and rubbed his hands over his body. 75 No broken bones, said Thornton. Theres many bruises and a terrible state of starvation, but no broken bones. Thornton looked in Bucks direction. The two watched as the sled crawled along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down. Mercedes screamed. They saw Charles turn and make one last attempt to run",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),13,"back, but the ice gave way. The bottom dropped out of the trail. All of them disappeared in a gaping hole. Thornton and Buck looked at each other. Buck licked Thorntons hand to show how grateful he was. 76 9 Devoted Friends When Thorntons feet froze the December before, his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well. They traveled up the river to find a raft headed for Dawson. He was still limping a little at the time he rescued Buck. But the limp soon left him as the weather grew warmer. Like Thornton, Buck also did his healing in the warm, sunny weather. After 3,000 miles, a long rest was what Buck needed. He slowly won back his strength. His muscles swelled out and the flesh came back to cover his bones. Two dogs had joined them on these lazy days. Skeet was a little Irish Setter who found Buck at his lowest point. Like a cat who washes 77 her kittens, she cleaned Bucks wounds each day. She always kept one eye on Buck. Nig was a huge, black dog. He was half bloodhound and half deerhound. Both dogs were good-natured. To Bucks surprise, neither dog felt any jealousy toward him. They seemed to share the kindness and gentleness of Thornton. Thornton clearly loved all of these dogs. As Buck grew stronger, he romped and played with Skeet and Nig. Buck felt a genuine love for the first time. He had never experienced it at Judge Millers down in the Santa Clara Valley. When he hunted with the Judges sons, it felt more like a partnership. With the grandsons, he felt like a guardian. With the Judge, he felt friendship. But with Thornton, Buck felt love. This man not only saved his life but was an ideal master. Other men took care of their dogs due to a sense of duty. It was something they had to do. Some did it for a business venture. 78 Thornton was different. He did it because he wanted to. He did it because he looked at the dogs as if they were his children. He treated them as such. Their days were filled with long talks and lots of play. Thornton had a way of taking Bucks head between his hands and resting his own head on Bucks. Hed shake Buck back and forth as he spoke lovingly to him. Buck knew no greater joy than this rough embrace. With each shake back and forth, Bucks heart would shake with sheer love for his master. In turn, Buck would clamp his teeth down on Thorntons hand. He would bite hard enough to leave teeth marks behind. This was how Buck showed his love for Thornton and thats exactly how Thornton saw it. Although Buck went wild with happiness whenever Thornton touched him, he didnt go looking for it. Skeet was different. She would shove her nose under Thorntons hand and 79 nudge until petted. Nig would rest his head on Thorntons knee until a scratch landed upon it. Buck, however, was just happy to admire Thornton at a distance. He could spend hours staring at Thornton. Thornton would always sense Bucks loving gaze and return it. For a long time after his rescue, Buck never wanted to let Thornton out of his sight. Buck followed at his heels wherever he went. Buck was afraid that he would disappear just like all the others who had come before him. Even when he slept, Buck would often have nightmares of Thornton leaving him. When this happened, Buck would creep through the chill of the night to the flap of the tent. Hed stand over his master and listen to the sound of his breathing. It was only then could Buck be sure his master was still with him. Despite his love for Thornton, Bucks wild side continued to call him. He was faithful and loyal to Thornton, yet he longed to run free. 80 Buck was getting older and becoming more like a wild dog. It was as if he came in from the wild to sit around Thorntons fire. He appeared before Thornton as a broad-breasted dog, white fanged and long furred. But always his ways of half wolves and wild wolves lay near the surface. After a while, Buck felt an urge to run into the forest. He didnt know where he ran to or why he felt such a need to run. But he knew he had to do it. Then, after a time, he would remember how much he loved John Thornton and hed run like the wind back to camp. His love for Thornton grew each day. He didnt care at all for any other man. Travelers would pet him, but he felt cold",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),14,"under their touch. He would often just get up and walk away from those who praised him. Unless the kind words came from Thornton, Buck paid no attention. When Thorntons partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the raft, Buck ignored them. He 81 refused to acknowledge them until he learned they were friends of Thorntons. After that, he simply felt as though he had to put up with them. His only concern was for his master. It didnt take Hans and Pete long to know where they stood with Buck. They kept their distance and played with Skeet and Nig instead. Bucks love for Thornton grew stronger as each season passed. He was the only man that Buck would ever allow to put a pack on his back when they traveled. Nothing was too great for Buck to do as long as the command came from Thornton. One day, the men and dogs were resting on a steep cliff. The cliff fell away straight down to a bedrock at least 300 feet below. Thornton sat at the edge with Buck at his shoulders. How devoted do you think Buck is to me? asked Thornton. Ive never seen a dog so loyal. So taken with his master, said Hans. 82 Pete nodded in agreement. I agree. Buck is yours and yours alone. Bucks eyes never left Thornton. Thornton swept his arm out over the cliff. Jump, Buck! As Buck started to jump, the three men pulled him back in. Its scary how he listens to you, said Pete, catching his breath. Thornton looked at Buck. It is scary and splendid and terrible all at the same time. I sure wouldnt want to be the man who lays a hand on you, said Pete, nodding his head toward Buck. By jingo! Hans shouted. The man who messes with you is indeed a sorry man. 83 10 An Amazing Feat By the years end, Pete and Hanss worries came true. During their travels, they met an evil man named Black Burton. He had been picking a fight with a newcomer at the hotel bar. As Buck rested in the corner with his eyes fixed on his master, Thornton stepped in to break up the fight. Burton struck out without warning, and he knocked Thornton to the ground. In a flash, Buck was on all fours. No one heard any barking or yelping. It was a sound that could only be described as a roar. They saw Buck rise up in the air and grab Burtons throat. 84 Buck tore open Burtons throat and soon the crowd was upon Buck beating him down. He was driven off Burton and brought outside where he prowled up and down. He attempted to rush in and finish Burton off for good but was forced down. A meeting was held. Since all agreed that Burton started the fight, Buck was allowed to remain free. From that day on, his name spread across every camp in Alaska. In the fall, Buck saved Thorntons life once again in a different way. The three partners were moving a small, narrow boat down a rough stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek. Hans and Pete moved about the bank holding a rope that was attached to the boat. Thornton remained in the boat steering and shouting directions at the men. Buck was on the bank, and he never took his eyes off of Thornton. He feared something terrible could happen at any moment. 85 There was a rough spot where rocks jutted out into the river. The ropes got caught up in these rocks and the boat tipped over. Thornton was thrown into the water and headed downstream to the worst part of the rapids. It was in this stretch of rapids that no man could survive. Buck sprang into action. He jumped into the water and managed to catch up with Thornton some 300 yards away. When he felt Thornton grasp his tail, Buck started swimming back to shore. The progress forward was slow because the rapids were too strong. Thornton knew the battle that was ahead of them. He knew he couldnt make it to shore so he reached out and caught hold of the slippery rocks that he had slammed into. Buck continued downstream. Due to the strong currents, he was unable to swim back to his master. He struggled desperately but couldnt find his way back. In a few minutes, he 86 87 could hear Thorntons voice rise above the roar of the river. Swim, Buck. Swim! Thorntons voice gave him the strength he needed to continue on. He swam toward the voice but it was too far away. When he looked to the left, he saw Pete and Hans motioning him toward them. Buck slowly made his",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),15,"way over the gushing water. Eventually, Pete and Hans pulled him ashore. Pete and Hans knew that Thornton couldnt hold on to the slippery rocks much longer. They ran up to the part of the bank where Thornton was clinging to the rock. They attached a rope to Buck. Buck jumped in and was determined to succeed in his rescue this time. He swam until the current pulled him toward Thornton. It was hard work and more than once, Buck was pulled under. He questioned his own survival. But then he heard Thorntons voice once again, which acted like an electric shock. Buck 88 swam full force striking Thornton like a battering ram. Thornton clasped his hands around the shaggy neck as Pete and Hans pulled the rope closer to them. Minutes later, both Buck and Thornton were upon the dry land. Thornton was bruised and battered and Buck had three broken ribs. That settles it, said Thornton once he caught his breath. Well camp right here. And camp they did until Bucks ribs healed and he was able to travel. That winter in Dawson, Buck did something amazing. Perhaps it wasnt as heroic as saving his masters life, but it was something that would put his name yet higher on the totem pole of Alaskan fame. It happened when the men made a trip to the East where miners had not yet appeared. The conversation took place in the Eldorado Saloon. It was here that all men bragged about their dogs. 89 Many directed their boasting toward John Thornton after hearing never-ending tales about Buck. These men didnt see anything special in Buck and started arguing with Thornton. My dog can start a sled with 500 pounds and walk off with it, said one man. Thats nothing, said another man. My dog can carry 600 pounds and walk off with it. Big deal, said Thornton. He looked over at Buck. My Buck can pull a sled with 1,000 pounds on it. And break out of the ice and walk with it for 100 yards? asked the first man. Thornton acted coolly. And break it out and walk off with it for 100 yards. Well, well, said a man named Matthewson for all to hear. Ive got $1,000 that says he cant. He slammed a sack of gold dust on the bar. Here it is. Nobody spoke. Thorntons bluff had been called. He felt a flush creeping up his face. His 90 tongue had tricked him. He spoke too fast. Could Buck walk off with 1,000 pounds? That was half a ton! He had no idea, but he did have great faith in Bucks strength. Still, what he didnt have was $1,000. Nor did Hans or Pete. Ive got a sled outside with twenty fifty- pound sacks of flour on it, said Matthewson. Thats 1,000 pounds. He glanced around the room and pointed to Thornton. Whats he waiting for? Lets get started! Thornton didnt answer. He didnt know what to say. He glanced from face to face and stopped when he saw Jim OBrien, an old friend. Can you lend me $1,000? he asked almost in a whisper. Sure, answered OBrien as he plunked down a sack next to Matthewsons. But I dont know if I have the faith in your dog. The Eldorado emptied out onto the street. Several hundred men gathered around the sled in the sixty below zero weather. Matthewsons 91 sled had been standing for several hours in the cold and its runners had frozen to the hard- packed snow. Men placed bets on whether Buck could achieve what was promised. Not one man believed him capable of the feat. Thornton saw the team of ten dogs curled up in the snow before the sled. It was then that Thornton knew just how impossible this task would be. Although worried, his fighting spirit was alive. The team of ten dogs were unhitched and Buck, in his own harness, was put into the sled. Buck could feel excitement in the air and knew he must do something great for Thornton. The crowd admired the fine shape Buck was in. He was back up to his 140 pounds and his coat was furry and shone like silk. A voice cried out, Ill give you $800 for him right now. Thornton shook his head. 92 Matthewson spoke up. How about we raise our bet? I got 600 more dollars. Thornton got caught up in the excitement. He, Pete, and Hans got the money. Thornton stepped to Bucks side. You cant be near him when he pulls, said Matthewson. Give him plenty of room. Thornton knelt down next to Buck. He took Bucks head in his hands and rested his cheek on Buck. He did not playfully shake him. Instead,",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),16,"he whispered, As you love me, Buck. As you love me. The crowd noticed a change in Buck. They saw the commitment in his eyes. Buck grabbed Thorntons hand between his jaws and bit down, leaving teeth marks. It was Buck showing his love. Thornton stepped back. Now, Buck! Buck tightened the harness and let it go loose for several inches. This was the way he had learned. Gee! Thorntons voice yelled out. 93 Buck swung to the right and plunged forward. The load shook and a crackling from under the runners could be heard. Haw! Thornton commanded. This time, Buck leaned toward the left. The crackling turned into snapping. The sled was broken out! The gathered men held their breath. Mush! Thorntons command cracked like a gunshot. Buck threw himself forward tightening the harness straps. His chest was low to the ground. His head reached forward and hung down while his feet flew like mad. The sled lurched forward. One inch. Two inches. Three inches. The sled gained speed and soon moved steadily along. The men gasped as Buck reached 100 yards. Cheers and chants rose to a steady roar. Buck stopped at Thorntons command. Men threw their hats and mittens into the air as they rushed toward Buck. 94 Ill give you $1,000 for him, came a distant shout. Make that $1,400. Thornton took Bucks head in his hands and shook him back and forth. Buck never felt so happy and full of love. He clamped down on Thorntons hand leaving teeth marks. Thornton looked at the men who had gathered. I wouldnt trade Buck for all the gold in Alaska. 95 11 AWolf Brother By winning the bet, Buck made it possible for his master to pay off debts and travel with his partners into the East. Thornton was lured by a fabled lost mine. Many men sought it. Few found it. Of those few who did, more than a few never returned from the journey. Thornton, Hans, Pete, Buck, and half a dozen other dogs sledded seventy miles up the Yukon. They swung to the left into the Stewart River and continued on until the river was nothing but a stream. Thornton didnt need much to survive. As long as he had a handful of salt and a rifle, he wasnt worried about the wild. He wasnt in any hurry. Time was on his side. Hed search 96 for his food much like the natives did. If he failed to find food, he kept looking knowing that sooner or later it would come to him. Buck loved the journey. The hunting, fishing, and wandering about through new places pleased him. For weeks at a time they would travel, day after day. Then, for weeks on end, they would set up camp. The men would pan for gold while the dogs would laze about. It was a good life. Sometimes, they went hungry and other times, they feasted. Summer came and went and with fall, they entered a strange lake country. It was sad and silent. There was no life at all. Instead, chilly winds greeted them. Fall turned to winter and they continued through wondrous trails. Once they were certain they were close to the lost mine when they came upon an ancient path. But the path, they soon found out, began nowhere and ended nowhere. It remained a mystery. 97 Spring came once again and with it, not the lost mine but a broad valley where gold glimmered at the bottom of their washing pans. The rocks were full of gold! The men looked no farther and settled on the rich land. Each day they found thousands of dollars worth of gold. Each nugget and speckle of dust went into moose-hide sacks. The men piled these bags like stacks of firewood outside of the small cabin they had made. There was nothing for the dogs to do except fetch the game that Thornton killed. Besides that, Buck spent long hours by the roaring fire. Buck dreamed that he heard something calling to him from the forest. Although he didnt know why, it made him happy. Sometimes Buck pursued the call from the forest. He would stick his nose into moss or into the soil where the grasses grew. At times, he would crouch for hours behind the trunks of fallen trees. He didnt know why he did these things. He just felt he had to do them. 98 One night, he sprang from his sleep and looked toward the forest. He was certain that he heard a call. It was distinct and certain as never before. He knew in an odd way that it was a sound that he had heard before. While everyone slept, he rushed into the woods and moved cautiously through the",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),17,"forest. Finally, he came to an open space among the trees. Looking out, he saw an animal on its hind legs. Its nose was pointed to the sky. It was a long, lean timber wolf. Buck made no noise but the wolf stopped howling and looked around. He sensed Bucks presence. Buck walked into the open and when the wolf saw him, he fled. Buck followed, hoping to overtake him. He chased him into a creek, where the wolf whirled about and showed his teeth. Buck did not attack. Instead, he circled him and tried to engage him in a friendly way. The wolf was afraid. After all, Buck weighed three times more. The wolf barely reached Bucks 99 shoulder. The first chance he got, the wolf bolted. The chase resumed. This happened many times that evening but finally, Buck was rewarded. The wolf came to understand that no harm would come his way. He sniffed noses with Buck. They became friendly and played. After a while, the wolf started off in a way that made it clear that Buck was to follow. So they ran side by side through the twilight, straight up the creek bed, and into the gorge. Buck felt wildly happy. He knew he was answering the call. He was running with his wood brother toward the place from where the call surely came. It wasnt until they stopped to drink that Buck remembered John Thornton. Buck sat down while the wolf continued on. When the wolf didnt see Buck by his side, he came back to Buck and urged him forward. But Buck turned about and started slowly back to camp. 100 For an hour, the wild brother ran by his side, whining softly. Then he sat down, pointed his nose upward, and howled. As Buck continued on his way, he heard the howl grow fainter until it could be heard no more. Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp. Buck jumped on Thornton with a frenzy of affection. He licked his face and bit his hand. For two days and two nights, Buck wouldnt let Thornton out of his sight. He refused to leave camp or go anywhere without Thornton. Buck followed him about while he worked. He watched him when he ate and slept. But at the end of the two days, the call from the forest called out to him once again. Bucks restlessness came back and he thought about his wild brother. He longed to see him again. Although he searched, he never found his brother or heard his mournful howl. Buck started to sleep away from the camp each evening. Then, he ventured farther from 101 camp, staying away for a week at a time. He searched in vain for his wild brother as he moved from one area to the next. He fished for salmon, killed a large black bear, and blinded by mosquitoes, raged through the forest. It wasnt long before Buck felt as if he was the best hunter in the world. Except for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes and the splash of white hair that ran down his chest, he looked like a giant wolf. He acted like a wolf. 102 12 Buck Answers the Call of the Wild Never was there such a dog, said Thornton one day as the partners watched Buck march out of camp. When he was made, the mold was broke, said Pete. By jingo! I agree, said Hans. The men watched Buck march out of camp. But they didnt see the instant and terrible change that took place the second he entered the forest. He no longer marched. Instead, he became a thing of the wild. He crawled on his belly like a snake and like a snake, he lurched forward to strike. 103 Buck could take a bird from its nest, kill a rabbit as it slept, and snap chipmunks in midair as they fled into nearby trees. Buck didnt kill for the sake of killing. No, Buck killed to eat. As fall approached, Buck noticed an increase of moose in the area. Buck had already killed a small one but now yearned to take down a bigger one. Buck spied a band of twenty moose drinking from the creek. The one in charge was mean and had a savage temper. He stood six feet from the ground. His antlers had fourteen points and reached seven feet within the tips. He roared with fury at the sight of Buck. It took four days, but Buck brought him down. He first separated the old bull from his herd. Then, he took him down and had his fill. After a few days, refreshed and full, Buck headed back to the camp. As he traveled,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),18,"he became aware of a certain stirring in the air. There was life but what life it was, Buck didnt know. The birds talked of it. 104 105 The squirrels chattered about it. The breeze whispered of it. The closer he got to camp, the greater sense of danger he felt. Three miles from camp, he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair rippling. It led straight toward camp and Thornton. Buck hurried on and the dead silence worried him. As Buck ran, his head jerked at a new smell off to the side of the road. When Buck investigated, he found Nig. An arrow had pierced his body. A hundred yards farther in, Buck came upon one of the sled dogs Thornton had brought to Dawson. The dog thrashed about in a death struggle. Buck passed around him without stopping. From the camp straight ahead came many voices. At the edge of camp, Buck found Hans lying on his face. An arrow had pierced him as well. Buck peered out at where the lodge had been and saw a sight that enraged him. Because of 106 his great love for Thornton, Buck went wild and lost his head. The Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage when they heard the roar. Buck hurled himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. Buck sprang at the nearest man, who was the chief. With his fangs, he ripped his neck open and a fountain of blood sprayed about. He didnt pause to worry about the man. Instead, he pounded on the next Yeehat and got the same results. Buck plunged about thrashing and killing until an arrow sailed by him and into the back of another hunter. When that Yeehat fell, a panic seized the rest of the natives. They fled in terror into the woods proclaiming that they fled an Evil Spirit. Buck chased after them dragging many to their death. When the last one was killed, Buck returned to an empty camp. Buck found Pete where he had been killed in his blankets. Thorntons desperate struggle 107 was fresh on the earth. Buck followed the scent down to the edge of a deep pool. By the edge, head and front feet in the water, was Skeet. Faithful to the end. The pool itself, muddied and bloodied, hid what it contained. For it contained Thornton. Buck had followed his scent to the water. There was no trace that led away. Buck felt a sadness he had never known. When he passed the dead Yeehats, he forgot his pain for a minute and took great pride in himself. He learned how easily he had killed man. They were much easier to bring down than he expected. As long as they had no spears or arrows, they were no match for him. When night fell, Buck noticed a new stirring in the woods. He stood up and heard a faint, sharp yelp from far away. It was quickly followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps. As the minutes passed, the yelps drew closer. 108 Again, Buck knew them as things he had heard in another world that persisted in his memory. He walked to the center of the open space and listened. It was the call. The call was stronger than it had ever been. He was finally ready to obey. John Thornton was dead. The last tie was broken. Man had no more claims on him and never would again. Hunting their living meat, the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the land of streams and timber and invaded Bucks valley. A silvery flood streamed into the clearing. At the center of the clearing, Buck stood motionless. He was waiting for them. The pack was awed by the sight of him. Within a minute, the boldest leaped straight for Buck. Like a flash, Buck struck and broke its neck. Three others tried attacking before they realized that Buck was stronger than they were. 109 The wolves drew back. In the moonlight, Buck could see their white fangs. Some were lying down with heads raised. Still, others were lapping water from the pool. One long, lean gray wolf advanced cautiously. Buck recognized him instantly. It was his wild brother with whom he had run and played. They both whined softly and touched noses. Then an old wolf stepped forward. Buck rubbed noses with him as well. After that, the older wolf sat down, pointed his nose toward the moon, and broke out the long wolf howl. All the others sat down and howled with him. Buck, too, sat down and howled. The others yelped in chorus as they sprang away into the woods. Buck ran with them, side by side with his wild brother, yelping as he",no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Jack Londons The Call of the Wild -- Jack London (Adapted by Lisa Mullarkey) -- ( WeLib.org ),19,"ran. And here may end the story of Buck. The years were not many when the Yeehats noted a 110 change in the breed of timber wolves. Some were seen with splashes of brown on their heads and muzzles. Others had a patch of white hair running down the chest. But more remarkable than this, the Yeehats tell the story of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack. They are afraid of this Ghost Dog. For it steals from their camps, robs their traps, slays their dogs, and defies their brave hunters. Now the tale grows worse. Many Yeehats who failed to return to camp were found. They had their throats slashed and there were wolf prints around them in the snow. These were greater than the prints of any wolf. Each fall, when the Yeehats follow the movement of the moose, there is one valley they refuse to enter. They tell stories about how an evil spirit came one year and decided to live in that valley. 111 In the summers, there is one animal that travels out of that valley. It is a great wolf unlike any others. It crosses alone from the timberland and comes down to an open space among the trees. Here, a yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the ground. Long grasses grow through them and overrun the ground. This wolf stays for a time dreaming and howling one long, mournful howl before leaving. 112",no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,0,"An Introduction for The Sound and the Fury The Southern Review 8 (N.S., 1972) 705-10. I wrote this book and learned to read. I had learned a little about writing from Soldiers' Pay--how to approach language, words: not with seriousness so much, as an essayist does, but with a kind of alert respect, as you approach dynamite; even with joy, as you approach women: perhaps with the same secretly unscrupulous intentions. But when I finished The Sound and the Fury I discovered that there is actually something to which the shabby term Art not only can, but must, be applied. I discovered then that I had gone through all that I had ever read, from Henry James through Henty to newspaper murders, without making any distinction or digesting any of it, as a moth or a goat might. After The Sound and The Fury and without heeding to open another book and in a series of delayed repercussions like summer thunder, I discovered the Flauberts and Dostoievskys and Conrads whose books I had read ten years ago. With The Sound and the Fury I learned to read and quit reading, since I have read nothing since. Nor do I seem to have learned anything since. While writing Sanctuary, the next novel to The Sound and the Fury, that part of me which learned as I wrote, which perhaps is the very force which drives a writer to the travail of invention and the drudgery of putting seventy- five or a hundred thousand words on paper, was absent because I was still reading by repercussion the books which I had swallowed whole ten years and more ago. I learned only from the writing of Sanctuary that there was something missing; something which The Sound and the Fury gave me and Sanctuary did not. When I began As I Lay Dying I had discovered what it was and knew that it would be also missing in this case because this would be a deliberate book. I set out deliberately to write a tour-de-force. Before I ever put pen to paper and set down the first word, I knew what the last word would be and almost where the last period would fall. Before I began I said, I am going to write a book by which, at a pinch, I can stand or fall if I never touch ink again. So when I finished it the cold satisfaction was there, as I had expected, but as I had also expected the other quality which The Sound and the Fury had given me was absent that emotion definite and physical and yet nebulous to describe: that ecstasy, that eager and joyous faith and anticipation of surprise which the yet unmarred sheet beneath my hand held inviolate and unfailing waiting for release. It was not there in As I Lay Dying. I said, It is because I knew too much about this book before I began to write it. I said, More than likely I shall never again have to know this much about a book before I begin to write it, and next time it will return. I waited almost two years, then I began Light in August, knowing no more about it than a young woman, pregnant, walking along a strange country road. I thought, I will recapture it now, since I know no more about this book than I did about The Sound and the Fury when I sat down before the first blank page. It did not return. The written pages grew in number. The story was going pretty well: I would sit down to it each morning without reluctance yet still without that anticipation and that joy which alone ever made writing pleasure to me. The book was almost finished before I acquiesced to the fact that it would not recur, since I was now aware before each word was written down just what the people would do, since now I was deliberately choosing among possibilities and probabilities of behavior and weighing and measuring each choice by the scale of the Jameses and Conrads and Balzacs. I knew that I had read too much, that I had reached that stage which all young writers must pass through, in which he believes that he has learned too much about his trade. I received a copy of the printed book and I found that I didn't even want to see what kind of jacket Smith had put on it. I seemed to have a vision of it and the other ones subsequent to The Sound and The Fury ranked in order upon a shelf while I looked at the titled backs of them with a flagging attention which was almost distaste, and upon which each succeeding title registered less and less,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,1,"until at last Attention itself seemed to say, Thank God I shall never need to open any one of them again. I believed that I knew then why I had not recaptured that first ecstasy, and that I should never again recapture it; that whatever treenovels I should write in the future would be written without reluctance, but also without anticipation or joy: that in the Sound and The Fury I had already put perhaps the only thing in literature which would ever move me very much: Caddy climbing the pear tree to look in the window at her grandmother's funeral while Quentin and Jason and Benjy and the negroes looked up at the muddy seat of her drawers. This is the only one of the seven novels which I wrote without any accompanying feeling of drive or effort, or any following feeling of exhaustion or relief or distaste. When I began it I had no plan at all. I wasn't even writing a book. I was thinking of books, publication, only in the reverse, in saying to myself, I wont have to worry about publishers liking or not liking this at all. Four years before I had written Soldiers' Pay. It didn't take long to write and it got published quickly and made me about five hundred dollars. I said, Writing novels is easy. You dont make much doing it, but it is easy. I wrote Mosquitoes. It wasn't quite so easy to write and it didn't get published quite as quickly and it made me about four hundred dollars. I said, Apparently there is more to writing novels, being a novelist, than I thought. I wrote Sartoris. It took much longer, and the publisher refused it at once. But I continued to shop it about for three years with a stubborn and fading hope, perhaps to justify the time which I had spent writing it. This hope died slowly, though it didn't hurt at all. One day I seemed to shut a door between me and all publishers' addresses and book lists. I said to myself, Now I can write. Now I can make myself a vase like that which the old Roman kept at his bedside and wore the rim slowly away with kissing it. So I, who had never had a sister and was fated to lose my daugher in infancy, set out to make myself a beautiful and tragic little girl. An Introduction to The Sound and the Fury Mississippi Quarterly 26 (Summer 1973): 410-415. Art is no part of southern life. In the North it seems to be different. It is the hardest minor stone in Manhattan's foundation. It is a part of the glitter or shabbiness of the streets. The arrowing buildings rise out of it and because of it, to be torn down and arrow again. There will be people leading small bourgeois lives (those countless and almost invisible bones of its articulation, lacking any one of which the whole skeleton might collapse) whose bread will derive from it--polyglot boys and girls progressing from tenement schools to editorial rooms and art galleries, men with grey hair and paunches who run linotype machines and take up tickets at concerts and then go sedately home to Brooklyn and suburban stations where children and grandchildren await them--long after the descendants of Irish politicians and Neapolitan racketeers are as forgotten as the wild Indians and the pigeon And of Chicago too: of that rhythm not always with harmony or tune lusty, loudvoiced, always changing and always young; drawing from a river basin which is almost a continent young men and women into its living unrest and then spewing them forth again to write Chicago in New England and Virginia and Europe. But in the South art, to become visible at all, must become a ceremony, a spectacle; something between a gypsy encampment and a church bazaar given by a handful of alien mummers who must waste themselves in protest and active self-defense until there is nothing left with which to speak--a single week, say, of furious endeavor for a show to be held on Friday night and then struck and vanished, leaving only a paint- stiffened smock or a worn out typewriter ribbon in the corner and perhaps a small bill for cheesecloth or bunting in the hands of an astonished and bewildered tradesman. Perhaps this is because the South (I speak in the sense of the indigenous dream of any given collection of men having something in common' be it only geography and climate, which shape their economic and spiritual aspirations into cities, into a pattern of houses or behavior) is old since dead. New York, whatever it may believe of itself, is young since alive; it is still a logical and unbroken progression from",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,2,"the Dutch. And Chicago even boasts of being young. But the South, as Chicago is the Middlewest and New York the East, is dead, killed by the Civil War. There is a thing known whimsically as the New South to be sure, but it is not the south. It is a land of Immigrants who are rebuilding the towns and cities into replicas of towns and cities in Kansas and Iowa and Illinois, with skyscrapers and striped canvas awnings instead of wooden balconies, and teaching the young men who sell the gasoline and the waitresses in the restaurants to say O yeah? and to speak with hard r's, and hanging over the intersections of quiet and shaded streets where no one save Northern tourists in Cadillacs and Lincolns ever pass at a gait faster than a horse trots, changing red-and-green lights and savage and peremptory bells. Yet this art, which has no place in southern life, is almost the sum total of the Southern artist. It is his breath, blood, flesh, all. Not so much that it is forced back upon him or that he is forced bodily into it by the circumstance; forced to choose, lady and tiger fashion, between being an artist and being a man. He does it deliberately; he wishes it so. This has always been true of him and of him alone. Only Southerners have taken horsewhips and pistols to editors about the treatment or maltreatment of their manuscript. This--the actual pistols--was in the old days, of course, we no longer succumb to the impulse. But it is still there, still within us. Because it is himself that the Southerner is writing about, not about his environment: who has, figuratively speaking, taken the artist in him in one hand and his milieu in the other and thrust the one into the other like a clawing and spitting cat into a croker sack. And he writes. We have never got and probably will never get, anywhere with music or the plastic forms. We need to talk, to tell, since oratory is our heritage. We seem to try in the simple furious breathing (or writing) span of the individual to draw a savage indictment of the contemporary scene or to escape from it into a makebelieve region of swords and magnolias and mockingbirds which perhaps never existed anywhere. Both of the courses are rooted in sentiment; perhaps the ones who write savagely and bitterly of the incest in clayfloored cabins are the most sentimental. Anyway, each course is a matter of violent partisanship, in which the writer unconsciously writes into every line and phrase his violent despairs and rages and frustrations or his violent prophesies of still more violent hopes. That cold intellect which can write with calm and complete detachment and gusto of its contemporary scene is not among us; I do not believe there lives the Southern writer who can say without lying that writing is any fun to him. Perhaps we do not want it to be. I seem to have tried both of the courses. I have tried to escape and I have tried to indict. After five years I look back at The Sound and The Fury and see that that was the fuming point: in this book I did both at one time. When I began the book, I had no plan at all. I wasn't even writing a book. Previous to it I had written three novels, with progressively decreasing ease and pleasure, and reward or emolument. The third one was shopped about for three years during which I sent it from publisher to publisher with a kind of stubborn and fading hope of at least justifying the paper I had used and the time I had spent writing it. This hope must have died at last, because one day it suddenly seemed as if a door had clapped silently and forever to between me and all publishers' addresses and booklists and I said to myself, Now I can write. Now I can just write. Whereupon I, who had three brothers and no sisters and was destined to lose my first daughter in infancy, began to write about a little girl. I did not realise then that I was trying to manufacture the sister which I did not have and the daughter which I was to lose, though the former might have been apparent from the fact that Caddy had three brothers almost before I wrote her name on paper. I just began to write about a brother and a sister splashing one another in the brook and the sister fell and wet her clothing and the smallest brother cried, thinking that the sister was conquered or perhaps hurt. Or perhaps he knew that he was the baby and that",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,3,"she would quit whatever water battles to comfort him. When she did so, when she quit the water fight and stooped in her wet garments above him, the entire story, which is all told by that same little brother in the first section, seemed to explode on the paper before me. I saw that peaceful glinting of that branch was to become the dark, harsh flowing of time sweeping her to where she could not return to comfort him, but that just separation, division, would not be enough not far enough. It must sweep her into dishonor and shame too. And that Benjy must never grow beyond this moment; that for him all knowing must begin and end with that fierce, panting, paused and stooping wet figure which smelled like trees. That he must never grow up to where the grief of bereavement could be leavened with understanding and hence the alleviation of rage as in the case of Jason, and of oblivion as in the case of Quentin. I saw that they had been sent to the pasture to spend the afternoon to get them away from the house during the grandmother's funeral in order that the three brothers and the nigger children could look up at the muddy seat of Caddy's drawers as she climbed the tree to look in the window at the funeral, without then realising the symbology of the soiled drawers, for here again hers was the courage which was to face later with honor the shame which she was to engender, which Quentin and Jason could not face: the one taking refuge in suicide, the other in vindictive rage which drove him to rob his bastard niece of the meagre sums which Caddy could send her. For I had already gone on to night and the bedroom and Dilsey with the mudstained drawers scrubbing the naked backside of that doomed little girl--trying to cleanse with the sorry byblow of its soiling that body, flesh, whose shame they symbolised and prophesied, as though she already saw the dark future and the part she was to play in it trying to hold that crumbling household together. Then the story was complete, finished. There was Dilsey to be the future, to stand above the fallen ruins of the family like a ruined chimney, gaunt, patient and indomitable; and Benjy to be the past. He had to be an idiot so that, like Dilsey, he could be impervious to the future, though unlike her by refusing to accept it at all. Without thought or comprehension; shapeless, neuter, like something eyeless and voiceless which might have lived, existed merely because of its ability to suffer, in the beginning of life; half fluid, groping: a pallid and helpless mass of all mindless agony under sun, in time yet not of it save that he could nightly carry with him that fierce, courageous being who was to him but a touch and a sound that may be heard on any golf links and a smell like trees, into the slow bright shapes of sleep. The story is all there, in the first section as Benjy told it. I did not try deliberately to make it obscure; when I realised that the story might be printed, I took three more sections, all longer than Benjy's, to try to clarify it. But when I wrote Benjy's section, I was not writing it to be printed. If I were to do it over now I would do it differently, because the writing of it as it now stands taught me both how to write and how to read, and even more: It taught me what I had already read, because on completing it I discovered, in a series of repercussions like summer thunder, the Flauberts and Conrads and Turgenievs which as much as ten years before I had consumed whole and without assimilating at all, as a moth or a goat might. I have read nothing since; I have not had to. And I have learned but one thing since about writing. That is, that the emotion definite and physical and yet nebulous to describe which the writing of Benjy's section of The Sound and The Fury gave me--that ecstasy, that eager and joyous faith and anticipation of surprise which the yet unmarred sheets beneath my hand held inviolate and unfailing--will not return. The unreluctance to begin, the cold satisfaction in work well and arduously done, is there and will continue to be there as long as I can do it well. But that other will not return. I shall never know it again. So I wrote Quentin's and Jason's sections, trying to clarify Benjy's. But I saw that I was merely temporising; That I should have to get completely out of the book.",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,4,"I realised that there would be compensations, that in a sense I could then give a final turn to the screw and extract some ultimate distillation. Yet it took me better than a month to take pen and write The day dawned bleak and chill before I did so. There is a story somewhere about an old Roman who kept at his bedside a Tyrrhenian vase which he loved and the rim of which he wore slowly away with kissing it. I had made myself a vase, but I suppose I knew all the time that I could not live forever inside of it, that perhaps to have it so that I too could lie in bed and look at it would be better; surely so when that day should come when not only the ecstasy of writing would be gone, but the unreluctance and the something worth saying too. It's fine to think that you will leave something behind you when you die, but it's better to have made something you can die with. Much better the muddy bottom of a little doomed girl climbing a blooming pear tree in April to look in the window at the funeral. Oxford. 19 August, 1933. April 7, 1928 Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them hitting. They were coming toward where the flag was and I went along the fence. Luster was hunting in the grass by the flower tree. They took the flag out, and they were hitting. Then they put the flag back and they went to the table, and he hit and the other hit. Then they went on, and I went along the fence. Luster came away from the flower tree and we went along the fence and they stopped and we stopped and I looked through the fence while Luster was hunting in the grass. ""Here, caddie."" He hit. They went away across the pasture. I held to the fence and watched them going away. ""Listen at you, now."" Luster said. ""Aint you something, thirty three years old, going on that way. After I done went all the way to town to buy you that cake. Hush up that moaning. Aint you going to help me find that quarter so I can go to the show tonight."" They were hitting little, across the pasture. I went back along the fence to where the flag was. It flapped on the bright grass and the trees. ""Come on."" Luster said. ""We done looked there. They aint no more coming right now. Les go down to the branch and find that quarter before them niggers finds it."" It was red, flapping on the pasture. Then there was a bird slanting and tilting on it. Luster threw. The flag flapped on the bright grass and the trees. I held to the fence. ""Shut up that moaning."" Luster said. ""I cant make them come if they aint coming, can I. If you dont hush up, mammy aint going to have no birthday for you. If you dont hush, you know what I going to do. I going to eat that cake all up. Eat them candles, too. Eat all them thirty three candles. Come on, les go down to the branch. I got to find my quarter. Maybe we can find one of they balls. Here. Here they is. Way over yonder. See."" He came to the fence and pointed his arm. ""See them. They aint coming back here no more. Come on. We went along the fence and came to the garden fence, where our shadows were. My shadow was higher than Luster's on the fence. We came to the hroken place and went through it. ""Wait a minute."" Luster said. ""You snagged on that nail again. Cant you never crawl through here without snagging on that nail."" 4.1 Caddy uncaught me and we crawled through. Uncle Maury said to not let anybody see us, so we better stoop over, Caddy said. Stoop over, Benjy. Like this, see. We stooped over and crossed the garden, where the flowers rasped and rattled against us. The ground was hard. We climbed the fence, where the pigs were grunting and snuffing. I expect they're sorry because one of them got killed today, Caddy said. The ground was hard, churned and knotted. Keep your hands in your pockets, Caddy said. Or they'll get froze. You dont want your hands froze on Christmas, do you. 3.1 ""It's too cold out there."" Versh said. ""You dont want to go outdoors."" ""What is it now."" Mother said. ""He want to go out doors."" Versh said. ""Let him go."" Uncle Maury said. ""It's too cold."" Mother said. ""He'd better stay in. Benjamin. Stop that, now."" ""It wont hurt him."" Uncle Maury said. ""You,",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,5,"Benjamin."" Mother said. ""If vou dont be good, you'll have to go to the kitchen."" ""Mammy say keep him out the kitchen today."" Versh said. ""She say she got all that cooking to get done."" ""Let him go, Caroline."" Uncle Maury said. ""You'll worry yourself sick over him."" ""I know it."" Mother said. ""It's a judgment on me. I sometimes wonder."" ""I know, I know."" Uncle Maury said. ""You must keep your strength up. I'll make you a toddy."" ""It just upsets me that much more."" Mother said. ""Dont you know it does."" ""You'll feel better. "" Uncle Maury said. ""Wrap him up good, boy, and take him out for a while."" Uncle Maury went away. Versh went away. ""Please hush."" Mother said. ""We're trying to get you out as fast as we can. I dont want you to get sick."" Versh put my overshoes and overcoat on and we took my cap and went out. Uncle Maury was putting the bottle away in the sideboard in the diningroom. ""Keep him out about half an hour, boy."" Uncle Maury said. ""Keep him in the yard, now."" ""Yes, sir."" Versh said. ""We dont never let him get off the place."" We went out doors. The sun was cold and bright. ""Where you heading for."" Versh said. ""You dont think you going to town, does you."" We went through the rattling leaves. The gate was cold. ""You better keep them hands in your pockets."" Versh said. ""You get them froze onto that gate, then what you do. Whyn't you wait for them in the house."" He put my hands into my pockets. I could hear him rattling in the leaves. I could smell the cold. The gate was cold. ""Here some hickeynuts. Whooey. Git up that tree. Look here at this squirl, Benjy."" I couldn't feel the gate at all, but I could smell the bright cold. ""You better put them hands back in your pockets."" Caddy was walking. Then she was running, her booksatchel swinging and jouncing behind her. ""Hello, Benjy."" Caddy said. She opened the gate and came in and stooped down. Caddy smelled like leaves. ""Did you come to meet me."" she said. ""Did you come to meet Caddy. What did you let him get his hands so cold for, Versh."" ""I told him to keep them in his pockets."" Versh said. ""Holding on to that ahun gate."" ""Did you come to meet Caddy."" she said, rubbing my hands. ""What is it. What are you trying to tell Caddy."" Caddy smelled like trees and like when she says we were asleep. 19.2 What are you moaning about, Luster said. You can watch them again when we get to the branch. Here. Here's you a jimson weed. He gave me the flower. We went through the fence, into the lot. 3.2 ""What is it."" Caddy said ""What are you trying to tell Caddy. Did they send him out, Versh."" ""Couldn't keep him in."" Versh said. ""He kept on until they let him go and he come right straight down here, looking through the gate."" ""What is it."" Caddy said. ""Did you think it would be Christmas when I came home from school. Is that what you thought. Christmas is the day after tomorrow. Santy Claus, Benjy. Santy Claus. Come on, let's run to the house and get warm."" She took my hand and we ran through the bright rustling leaves. We ran up the steps and out of the bright cold, into the dark cold. Uncle Maury was putting the bottle back in the sideboard. He called Caddy. Caddy said, ""Take him in to the fire, Versh. Go with Versh."" she said. ""I'll come in a minute."" We went to the fire. Mother said, ""Is he cold, Versh."" ""Nome."" Versh said. ""Take his overcoat and overshoes off."" Mother said. ""How many times do I have to tell you not to bring him into the house with his overshoes on. ""Yessum."" Versh said. ""Hold still, now."" He took my overshoes off and unbuttoned my coat. Caddy said, ""Wait, Versh. Cant he go out again, Mother. I want him to go with me. ""You'd better leave him here."" Uncle Maury said. ""He's been out enough today."" ""I think you'd both better stay in."" Mother said. ""It's getting colder, Dilsey says."" ""Oh, Mother."" Caddy said. ""Nonsense."" Uncle Maury said. ""She's been in school all day. She needs the fresh air. Run along, Candace."" ""Let him go, Mother."" Caddy said. ""Please. You know he'll cry."" ""Then why did you mention it before him."" Mother said. ""Why did you come in here. To give him some excuse to worry me again. You've been out enough today. I think you'd better sit down here and play with him."" ""Let them go, Caroline."" Uncle Maury said. ""A",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,6,"little cold wont hurt them. Remember, you've got to keep your strength up. ""I know."" Mother said. ""Nobody knows how I dread Christmas. Nobody knows. I am not one of those women who can stand things. I wish for Jason's and the children's sakes I was stronger."" ""You must do the best you can and not let them worry you. "" Uncle Maury said. ""Run along. you two. But dont stay out long, now. Your mother will worry."" ""Yes, sir."" Caddy said. ""Come on, Benjy. We're going out doors again."" She buttoned my coat and we went toward the door. ""Are you going to take that baby out without his overshoes."" Mother said. ""Do you want to make him sick, with the house full of company."" ""I forgot."" Caddy said. ""I thought he had them on. We went back. ""You must think."" Mother said. Hold still now Versh said. He put my overshoes on. ""Someday I'll be gone, and you'll have to think for him."" Now stomp Versh said. ""Come here and kiss Mother, Benjamin."" Caddy took me to Mother's chair and Mother took my face in her hands and then she held me against her. ""My poor baby."" she said. She let me go. ""You and Versh take good care of him, honey."" ""Yessum."" Caddy said. We went out. Caddy said, ""You needn't go, Versh. I'll keep him for a while."" ""All right."" Versh said. ""I aint going out in that cold for no fun."" He went on and we stopped in the hall and Caddy knelt and put her arms around me and her cold bright face against mine. She smelled like trees. ""You're not a poor baby. Are you. Are you. You've got your Caddy. Haven't you got your Caddy."" 19.3 Cant you shut up that moaning and slobbering, Luster said. Aint you shamed of yourself, making all this racket. We passed the carriage house, where the carriage was. It had a new wheel. 17.1 ""Git in, now, and set still until your maw come."" Dilsey said. She shoved me into the carriage. T.P. held the reins. ""Clare I dont see how come Jason wont get a new surrey."" Dilsey said. ""This thing going to fall to pieces under you all some day. Look at them wheels."" Mother came out, pulling her veil down. She had some flowers. ""Where's Roskus."" she said. ""Roskus cant lift his arms, today."" Dilsey said. ""T.P. can drive all right."" ""I'm afraid to."" Mother said. ""It seems to me you all could furnish me with a driver for the carriage once a week. It's little enough I ask, Lord knows."" ""You know just as well as me that Roskus got the rheumatism too bad to do more than he have to, Miss Cahline."" Dilsey said. ""You come on and get in, now. T.P. can drive you just as good as Roskus."" ""I'm afraid to."" Mother said. ""With the baby."" Dilsey went up the steps. ""You calling that thing a baby."" she said. She took Mother's arm. ""A man big as T.P. Come on, now, if you going."" ""I'm afraid to."" Mother said. They came down the steps and Dilsey helped Mother in. ""Perhaps it'll be the best thing, for all of us."" Mother said. ""Aint you shamed, talking that way."" Dilsey said. ""Dont you know it'll take more than a eighteen year old nigger to make Queenie run away. She older than him and Benjy put together. And dont you start no projecking with Queenie, you hear me. T.P. If you dont drive to suit Miss Cahline, I going to put Roskus on you. He aint too tied up to do that."" ""Yessum."" T.P. said. ""I just know something will happen."" Mother said. ""Stop, Benjamin. ""Give him a flower to hold."" Dilsey said. ""That what he wanting."" She reached her hand in. ""No, no."" Mother said. ""You'll have them all scattered."" ""You hold them."" Dilsey said. ""I'll get him one out."" She gave me a flower and her hand went away. ""Go on now, fore Quentin see you and have to go too."" Dilsey said. ""Where is she."" Mother said. ""She down to the house playing with Luster."" Dilsey said. ""Go on, T.P. Drive that surrey like Roskus told you, now. ""Yessum."" T.P. said. ""Hum up, Queenie."" ""Quentin."" Mother said. ""Dont let "" ""Course I is."" Dilsey said. The carriage jolted and crunched on the drive. ""I'm afraid to go and leave Quentin."" Mother said. ""I'd better not go. T.P."" We went through the gate, where it didn't jolt anymore. T.P. hit Queenie with the whip. ""You, T.P."" Mother said. ""Got to get her going."" T.P. said. ""Keep her wake up till we get back to the barn."" ""Turn around."" Mother said. ""I'm afraid to go and leave Quentin."" ""Cant turn here.""",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,7,"T.P. said. Then it was broader. ""Cant you turn here."" Mother said. ""All right."" T.P. said. We began to turn. ""You, T.P."" Mother said, clutching me. ""I got to turn around some how."" T.P. said. ""Whoa, Queenie."" We stopped. ""You'll turn us over."" Mother said. ""What you want to do, then."" T.P. said. ""I'm afraid for you to try to turn around."" Mother said. ""Get up, Queenie."" T.P. said. We went on. ""I just know Dilsey will let something happen to Quentin while I'm gone."" Mother said. ""We must hurry back."" ""Hum up,' there."" T.P. said. He hit Queenie with the whip. ""You, T.P."" Mother said, clutching me. I could hear Qucenie's feet and the bright shapes went smooth and steady on both sides, the shadows of them flowing across Queenie's back. They went on like the bright tops of wheels. Then those on one side stopped at the tall white post where the soldier was. But on the other side they went on smooth and steady, but a little slower. ""What do you want."" Jason said. He had his hands in his pockets and a pencil behind his ear. ""We're going to the cemetery."" Mother said. ""All right."" Jason said. ""I dont aim to stop you, do I. Was that all you wanted with me, just to tell me that."" ""I know you wont come."" Mother said. ""I'd feel safer if you would."" ""Safe from what."" Jason said. ""Father and Quentin cant hurt you."" Mother put her handkerchief under her veil. ""Stop it, Mother."" Jason said. ""Do you want to get that damn looney to bawling in the middle of the square. Drive on, T.P."" ""Hum up, Queenie."" T.P. said. ""It's a judgment on me."" Mother said. ""But I'll be gone too, soon. ""Here."" Jason said. ""Whoa."" T.P. said. Jason said, ""Uncle Maury's drawing on you for fifty. What do you want to do about it."" ""Why ask me."" Mother said. ""I dont have any say so. I try not to worry you and Dilsey. I'll be gone soon, and then you "" ""Go on, T.P."" Jason said. ""Hum up, Queenie."" T.P. said. The shapes flowed on. The ones on thc other side began again, bright and fast and smooth, like when Caddy says we are going to sleep. 19.4 Cry baby, Luster said. Aint you shamed. We went through the barn. The stalls were all open. You aint got no spotted pony to ride now, Luster said. The floor was dry and dusty. The roof was falling. The slanting holes were full of spinning yellow. What do you want to go that way, for. You want to get your head knocked off with one of them balls. 4.2 Keep your hands in your pockets."" Caddy said. ""Or they'll be froze. You dont want your hands froze on Christmas, do you."" We went around the barn. The big cow and the little one were standing in the door, and we could hear Prince and Queenie and Fancy stomping inside the barn. ""If it wasn't so cold, we'd ride Fancy."" Caddy said. ""But it's too cold to hold on today."" Then we could seethe branch, where the smoke was blowing. ""That's where they are killing the pig."" Caddy said. ""We can come back by there and see them."" We went down the hill. ""You want to carry the letter."" Caddy said. ""You can carry it."" She took the letter out of her pocket and put it in mine. ""It's a Christmas present."" Caddy said. ""Uncle Maury is going to surprise Mrs Patterson with it. We got to give it to her without letting anybody see it. Keep your hands in your pockets good, now."" We came to the branch. ""It's froze."" Caddy said. ""Look."" She broke the top of the water and held a piece of it against my face. ""Ice. That means how cold it is."" She helped me across and we went up the hill. ""We cant even tell Mother and Father. You know what I think it is. I think it's a surprise for Mother and Father and Mr Patterson both, because Mr Patterson sent you some candy. Do you remember when Mr Patterson sent you some candy last summer. There was a fence. The vine was dry, and the wind rattled in it. ""Only I dont see why Uncle Maury didn't send Versh."" Caddy said. ""Versh wont tell."" Mrs Patterson was looking out the window. ""You wait here."" Caddy said. ""Wait right here, now. I'll be back in a minute. Give me the letter."" She took the letter out of my pocket. ""Keep your hands in your pockets."" She climbed the fence with the letter in her hand and went through the brown, rattling flowers. Mrs Patterson came to the door and opened it and stood",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,8,"there. 5.1 Mr Patterson was chopping in the green flowers. He stopped chopping and looked at me. Mrs Patterson came across the garden, running. When I saw her eyes I began to cry. You idiot, Mrs Patterson said, I told him never to send you alone again. Give it to me. Quick. Mr Patterson came fast, with the hoc. Mrs Patterson leaned across the fence, reaching her hand. She was trying to climb the fence. Give it to me, she said, Give it to me. Mr Patterson climbed the fence. He took the letter. Mrs Patterson's dress was caught on the fence. I saw her eyes again and I ran down the hill. 19.5 ""They aint nothing over yonder but houses."" Luster said. ""We going down to the branch."" They were washing down at the branch. One of them was singing. I could smell the clothes flapping, and the smoke blowing across the branch. ""You stay down here."" Luster said. ""You aint got no business up yonder. Them folks hit you, sho."" ""What he want to do."" ""He dont know what he want to do."" Luster said. ""He think he want to go up yonder where they knocking that hall. You sit down here and play with your jimson weed. Look at them chillen playing in the branch, if you got to look at something. How come you cant behave yourself like folks."" I sat down on the bank, where they were washing, and the smoke blowing blue. ""Is you all seen anything of a quarter down here."" Luster said.""What quarter."" """"The one I had here this morning."" Luster said. ""I lost it somewhere. It fell through this here hole in my pocket. If I dont find it I cant go to the show tonight."" ""Where'd you get a quarter, boy. Find it in white folks' pocket while they aint looking."" ""Got it at the getting place."" Luster said ""Plenty more where that one come ftom. Only I got to find that one. Is you all found it yet."" ""I aint studying no quarter. I got my own business to tend to."" ""Come on here."" Luster said. ""Help me look for it."" ""He wouldn't know a quarter if he was to see it, would he.""""He can help look just the same."" Luster said. ""You all going to the show tonight."" ""Dont talk to me about no show. Time I get done over this here tub I be too tired to lift my hand to do nothing."" ""I bet you be there."" Luster said. ""I bet you was there last night. I bet you all be right there when that tent open.""Be enough niggers there without me. Was last night."" ""Nigger's money good as white folks, I reckon."" ""White folks gives nigger money because know first white man comes along with a band going to get it all back, so nigger can go to work for some more."" ""Aint nobody going make you go to that show."" ""Aint yet. Aint thought of it, I reckon."" ""What you got against white folks."" ""Aint got nothing against them. I goes my way and lets white folks go theirs. I aint studying that show."" ""Got a man in it can play a tune on a saw. Play it like a banjo."" ""You go last night."" Luster said. ""I going tonight If I can find where I lost that quarter."" ""You going take him with you, I reckon."" ""Me."" Luster said. ""You reckon I be found anywhere with him, time he start bellering."" ""What does you do when he start bellering."" ""I whips him."" Luster said. He sat down and rolled up his overalls. They played in the branch. ""You all found any balls yet."" Luster said. ""Aint you talking biggity. I bet you better not let your grandmammy hear you talking like that."" Luster got into the branch, where they were playing. He hunted in the water, along the bank. ""I had it when we was down here this morning."" Luster said. ""Where bouts you lose it."" ""Right out this here hole in my pocket."" Luster said. They hunted in the branch. Then they all stood up quick and stopped, then they splashed and fought in the branch. Luster got it and they squatted in the water, looking up the hill through the bushes. ""Where is they."" Luster said. ""Aint in sight yet."" Luster put it in his pocket. They came down the hill. ""Did a hall come down here."" ""It ought to be in the water. Didn't any of you boys see it or hear it."" ""Aint heard nothing come down here."" Luster said. ""Heard something hit that tree up yonder. Dont know which way it went."" They looked in the branch. ""Hell. Look along the branch. It came down here. I saw",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,9,"it."" They looked along the branch. Then they went back up the hill. ""Have you got that ball."" the boy said. ""What I want with it."" Luster said. ""I aint seen no ball."" The boy got in the water. He went on. He turned and looked at Luster again. He went on down the branch. The man said ""Caddie"" up the hill. The boy got out of the water and went up the hill. ""Now, just listen at you."" Luster said. ""Hush up."" ""What he moaning about now."" ""Lawd knows."" Luster said. ""He just starts like that. He been at it all morning. Cause it his birthday, I reckon."" ""How old he."" ""He thirty three."" Luster said. ""Thirty three this morning."" ""You mean, he been three years old thirty years. ""I going by what mammy say."" Luster said. ""I dont know. We going to have thirty three candles on a cake, anyway. Little cake. Wont hardly hold them. Hush up. Come on back here."" He came and caught my arm. ""You old looney."" he said. ""You want me to whip you."" ""I bet you will."" ""I is done it. Hush, now."" Luster said. ""Aint I told you you cant go up there. They'll knock your head clean off with one of them balls. Come on, here."" He pulled me back. ""Sit down."" I sat down and he took off my shoes and rolled up my trousers. ""Now, git in that water and play and see can you stop that slobbering and moaning."" I hushed and got in the water [...] 1.1 [...]and Roskus came and said to come to supper and Caddy said, It's not supper time yet I'm not going. She was wet. We were playing in the branch and Caddy squatted down and got her dress wet and Versh said, ""Your mommer going to whip you for getting your dress wet."" ""She's not going to do any such thing."" Caddy said. ""How do you know."" Quentin said. ""That's all right how I know."" Caddy said. ""How do you know."" ""She said she was."" Quentin said. ""Besides, I'm older than you."" ""I'm seven years old."" Caddy said. ""I guess I know."" ""I'm older than that."" Quentin said. ""I go to school. Dont I, Versh."" ""I'm going to school next year."" Caddy said. ""When it comes. Aint I, Versh."" ""You know she whip you when you get your dress wet."" Versh said. ""It's not wet."" Caddy said. She stood up in the water and looked at her dress. ""I'll take it off."" she said. ""Then it'll dry."" ""I bet you wont."" Quentin said. ""I bet I will."" Caddy said. ""I bet you better not."" Quentin said. Caddy came to Versh and me and turned her back. ""Unbutton it, Versh."" she said. ""Dont you do it, Versh."" Quentin said. ""Taint none of my dress."" Versh said. ""You unbutton it, Versh."" Caddy said. ""Or I'll tell Dilsey what you did yesterday."" So Versh unbuttoned it. ""You just take your dress off."" Quentin said. Caddy took her dress off and threw it on the bank. Then she didn't have on anything but her bodice and drawers, and Quentin slapped her and she slipped and fell down in the water. When she got up she began to splash water on Quentin, and Quentin splashed water on Caddy. Some of it splashed on Versh and me and Versh picked me up and put me on the bank. He said he was going to tell on Caddy and Quentin, and then Quentin and Caddy began to splash water at Versh. He got behind a bush. ""I'm going to tell mammy on you all."" Versh said. Quentin climbed up the bank and tried to catch Versh, but Versh ran away and Quentin couldn't. When Quentin came back Versh stopped and hollered that he was going to tell. Caddy told him that if he wouldn't tell, they'd let him come back. So Versh said he wouldn't, and they let him. ""Now I guess you're satisfied."" Quentin said. ""We'll both get whipped now."" ""I dont care."" Caddy said. ""I'll run away."" ""Yes you will."" Quentin said. ""I'll run away and never come back."" Caddy said. I began to cry. Caddy turned around and said ""Hush"" So I hushed. Then they played in the branch. Jason was playing too. He was by himself further down the branch. Versh came around the bush and lifted me down into the water again. Caddy was all wet and muddy behind, and I started to cry and she came and squatted in the water. ""Hush now."" she said. ""I'm not going to run away."" So I hushed. Caddy smelled like trees in the rain. 19.6 What is the matter with you, Luster said. Cant you get done with that moaning and play in the",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,10,"branch like folks. Whyn't you take him on home. Didn't they told you not to take him off the place. He still think they own this pasture, Luster said. Cant nobody see down here from the house, noways. We can. And folks dont like to look at a looney. Taint no luck in it. 1.2 Roskus came and said to come to supper and Caddy said it wasn't supper time yet. ""Yes tis."" Roskus said. ""Dilsey say for you all to come on to the house. Bring them on, Versh."" He went up the hill, where the cow was lowing. ""Maybe we'll be dry by the time we get to the house."" Quentin said. ""It was all your fault."" Caddy said. ""I hope we do get whipped."" She put her dress on and Versh buttoned it. ""They wont know you got wet."" Versh said. ""It dont show on you. Less me and Jason tells."" ""Are you going to tell, Jason."" Caddy said. ""Tell on who."" Jason said. ""He wont tell."" Quentin said. ""Will you, Jason."" ""I bet he does tell."" Caddy said. ""He'll tell Damuddy."" ""He cant tell her."" Quentin said. ""She's sick. If we walk slow it'll be too dark for them to see."" ""I dont care whether they see or not."" Caddy said. ""I'm going to tell, myself. You carry him up the hill, Versh."" ""Jason wont tell."" Quentin said. ""You remember that bow and arrow I made you, Jason."" ""It's broke now."" Jason said. ""Let him tell."" Caddy said. ""I dont give a cuss. Carry Maury up the hill, Versh."" Versh squatted and I got on his back. 19.7 See you all at the show tonight, Luster said. Come on, here. We got to find that quarter. 1.3 ""If we go slow, it'll be dark when we get there."" Quentin said. ""I'm not going slow."" Caddy said. We went up the hill, but Quentin didn't come. He was down at the branch when we got to where we could smell the pigs. They were grunting and snuffing in the trough in the comer. Jason came behind us, with his hands in his pockets. Roskus was milking the cow in the barn door. 10.1 The cows came jumping out of the barn. ""Go on."" T.P. said. ""Holler again. I going to holler myself. Whooey."" Quentin kicked T.P. again. He kicked T.P. into the trough where the pigs ate and T.P. lay there. ""Hot dog."" T.P. said. ""Didn't he get me then. You see that white man kick me that time. Whooey."" I wasn't crying, but I couldn't stop. I wasn't crying, but the ground wasn't still, and then I was crying. The ground kept sloping up and the cows ran up the hill. T.P. tried to get up. He fell down again and the cows ran down the hill. Quentin held my arm and we went toward the barn. Then the barn wasn't there and we had to wait until it came back. I didn't see it come back. It came behind us and Quentin set me down in the trough where the cows ate. I held on to it. It was going away too, and I held to it. The cows ran down the hill again, across the door. I couldn't stop. Quentin and T.P. came up the hill, fighting. T.P. was falling down the hill and Quentin dragged him up the hill. Quentin hit T.P. I couldn't stop. ""Stand up."" Quentin said. ""You stay right here. Dont you go away until I get back."" ""Me and Benjy going back to the wedding."" T.P. said. ""Whooey."" Quentin hit T.P. again. Then he began to thump T.P. against the wall T.P. was laughing. Every time Quentin thumped him against the wall he tried to say Whooey, but he couldn't say it for laughing. I quit crying, but I couldn't stop. T.P. fell on me and the barn door went away. It went down the hill and T.P. was fighting by himself and he fell down again. He was still laughing, and I couldn't stop, and I tried to get up and I fell down, and I couldn't stop. Versh said, ""You sho done it now. I'll declare if you aint. Shut up that yelling."" T.P. was still laughing. He flopped on the door and laughed. ""Whooey."" he said. ""Me and Benjy going back to the wedding. Sassprilluh."" T.P. said. ""Hush."" Versh said. ""Where you get it."" ""Out the cellar."" T.P. said. ""Whooey."" ""Hush up."" Versh said. ""Where bouts in the cellar."" ""Anywhere."" T.P. said. He laughed some more. ""Moren a hundred boftles lef. Moren a million. Look out, nigger, I going to holler."" Quentin said, ""Lift him up."" Versh lifted me up. ""Drink this, Benjy."" Quentin said. The glass was hot. ""Hush, now."" Quentin said. ""Drink it."" ""Sassprilluh.""",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,11,"T.P. said. ""Lemme drink it, Mr Quentin."" ""You shut your mouth."" Versh said. ""Mr Quentin wear you out."" ""Hold him, Versh."" Quentin said. They held me. It was hot on my chin and on my shirt. ""Drink."" Quentin said. They held my head. It was hot inside me, and I began again. I was crying now, and something was happening inside me and I cried more, and they held me until it stopped happening. Then I hushed. It was still going around, and then the shapes began. Open the crib, Versh. They were going slow. Spread those empty sacks on the floor. They were going faster, almost fast enough. Now. Pick up his feet. They went on, smooth and bright. I could hear T.P. laughing. I went on with them, up the bright hill. 1.4 At the top of the hill Versh put me down. ""Come on here, Quentin."" he called, looking back down the hill. Quentin was still standing there by the branch. He was chunking into the shadows where the branch was. ""Let the old skizzard stay there."" Caddy said. She took my hand and we went on past the barn and through the gate. There was a frog on the brick walk, squatting in the middle of it. Caddy stepped over it and pulled me on. ""Come on, Maury."" she said. It still squatted there until Jason poked at it with his toe. ""He'll make a wart on you."" Versh said. The frog hopped away. ""Come on, Maury."" Caddy said. ""They got company tonight."" Versh said. ""How do you know."" Caddy said. ""With all them lights on."" Versh said. ""Light in every window."" ""I reckon we can turn all the lights on without company, if we want to."" Caddy said. ""I bet it's company. "" Versh said. ""You all befter go in the back and slip upstairs."" ""I dont care."" Caddy said. ""I'll walk right in the parlor where they are. ""I bet your pappy whip you if you do."" Versh said. ""I dont care."" Caddy said. ""I'll walk right in the parlor. I'll walk right in the dining room and eat supper."" ""Where you sit."" Versh said. ""I'd sit in Damuddy's chair."" Caddy said. ""She eats in bed."" ""I'm hungry. "" Jason said. He passed us and ran on up the walk. He had his hands in his pockets and he fell down. Versh went and picked him up. ""If you keep them hands out your pockets, you could stay on your feet."" Versh said. ""You cant never get them out in time to catch yourself, fat as you is."" Father was standing by the kitchen steps. ""Where's Quentin."" he said. ""He coming up the walk."" Versh said. Quentin was coming slow. His shirt was a white blur. ""Oh."" Father said. Light fell down the steps, on him. ""Caddy and Quentin threw water on each other. "" Jason said. We waited. ""They did."" Father said. Quentin came, and Father said, ""You can eat supper in the kitchen tonight."" He stooped and took me up, and the light came tumbling down the steps on me too, and I could look down at Caddy and Jason and Quentin and Versh. Father turned toward the steps. ""You must be quiet, though."" he said. ""Why must we be quiet, Father."" Caddy said. ""Have we got company. ""Yes."" Father said. ""I told you they was company."" Versh said. ""You did not."" Caddy said. ""I was the one that said there was. I said I would "" ""Hush."" Father said. They hushed and Father opened the door and we crossed the back porch and went in to the kitchen. Dilsey was there, and Father put me in the chair and closed the apron down and pushed it to the table, where supper was. It was steaming up. ""You mind Dilsey, now."" Father said. ""Dont let them make any more noise than they can help, Dilsey."" ""Yes, sir."" Dilsey said. Father went away. ""Remember to mind Dilsey, now."" he said behind us. I leaned my face over where the supper was. It steamed up on my face. ""Let them mind me tonight, Father."" Caddy said. ""I wont."" Jason said. ""I'm going to mind Dilsey."" ""You'll have to, if Father says so."" Caddy said. ""Let them mind me, Father."" ""I wont."" Jason said. ""I wont mind you."" ""Hush."" Father said. ""You all mind Caddy, then. When they are done, bring them up the back stairs, Dilsey."" ""Yes, sir."" Dilsey said. ""There."" Caddy said. ""Now I guess you'll mind me. ""You all hush, now."" Dilsey said. ""You got to be quiet tonight."" ""Why do we have to be quiet tonight."" Caddy whispered. ""Never you mind."" Dilsey said. ""You'll know in the Lawd's own time."" She brought my bowl. The steam from it came and tickled",no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,12,"my face. ""Come here, Versh."" Dilsey said. ""When is the Lawd's own time, Dilsey."" Caddy said. ""It's Sunday."" Quentin said. ""Dont you know anything."" ""Shhhhhh."" Dilsey said. ""Didn't Mr Jason say for you all to be quiet. Eat your supper, now. Here, Versh. Git his spoon."" Versh's hand came with the spoon, into the bowl. The spoon came up to my mouth. The steam tickled into my mouth. Then we quit eating and we looked at each other and we were quiet, and then we heard it again and I began to cry. ""What was that."" Caddy said. She put her hand on my hand. ""That was Mother."" Quentin said. The spoon came up and I ate, then I cried again. ""Hush."" Caddy said. But I didn't hush and she came and put her arms around me. Dilsey went and closed both the doors and then we couldn't hear it. ""Hush, now."" Caddy said. I hushed and ate. Quentin wasn't eating, but Jason was. ""That was Mother."" Quentin said. He got up. ""You set right down."" Dilsey said. ""They got company in there, and you in them muddy clothes. You set down too, Caddy, and get done eating."" ""She was crying."" Quentin said. ""It was somebody singing."" Caddy said. ""Wasn't it, Dilsey."" ""You all eat your supper, now, like Mr Jason said."" Dilsey said. ""You'll know in the Lawd's own time."" Caddy went back to her chair. ""I told you it was a party."" she said. Versh said, ""He done et all that."" ""Bring his bowl here."" Dilsey said. The bowl went away. ""Dilsey."" Caddy said. ""Quentin's not eating his supper. Hasn't he got to mind me."" ""Eat your supper, Quentin."" Dilsey said. ""You all got to get done and get out of my kitchen."" ""I dont want any more supper. Quentin said. ""You've got to eat if I say you have."" Caddy said. ""Hasn't he, Dilsey."" The bowl steamed up to my face, and Versh's hand dipped the spoon in it and the steam tickled into my mouth. ""I dont want any more."" Quentin said. ""How can they have a party when Damuddy's sick."" ""They'll have it down stairs."" Caddy said. ""She can come to the landing and see it. That's what I'm going to do when I get my nightie on. ""Mother was crying. "" Quentin said. ""Wasn't she crying, Dilsey."" ""Dont you come pestering at me, boy."" Dilsey said. ""I got to get supper for all them folks soon as you all get done eating."" After a while even Jason was through eating, and he began to cry. ""Now you got to tune up."" Dilsey said. ""He does it every night since Damuddy was sick and he cant sleep with her."" Caddy said. ""Cry baby."" ""I'm going to tell on you."" Jason said. He was crying. ""You've already told."" Caddy said. ""There's not anything else you can tell, now."" ""You all needs to go to bed."" Dilsey said. She came and lifted me down and wiped my face and hands with a warm cloth. ""Versh, can you get them up the back stairs quiet. You, Jason, shut up that crying."" ""It's too early to go to bed now."" Caddy said. ""We dont ever have to go to bed this early."" ""You is tonight."" Dilsey said. ""Your paw say for you to come right on up stairs when you et supper. You heard him."" ""He said to mind me. "" Caddy said. ""I'm not going to mind you."" Jason said. ""You have to."" Caddy said. ""Come on, now. You have to do like I say. ""Make them be quiet, Versh."" Dilsey said. ""You all going to be quiet, aint you. ""What do we have to be so quiet for, tonight."" Caddy said. ""Your mommer aint feeling well."" Dilsey said. ""You all go on with Versh, now."" ""I told you Mother was crying. "" Quentin said. Versh took me up and opened the door onto the back porch. We went out and Versh closed the door black. I could smell Versh and feel him. You all be quiet, now. We're not going up stairs yet. Mr Jason said for you to come right up stairs. He said to mind me. I'm not going to mind you. But he said for all of us to. Didn't he, Quentin. I could feel Versh's head. I could hear us. Didn't he, Versh. Yes, that right. Then I say for us to go out doors a while. Come on. Versh opened the door and we went out. We went down the steps. ""I expect we'd better go down to Versh's house, so we'll be quiet."" Caddy said. Versh put me down and Caddy took my hand and we went down the brick walk. ""Come on."" Caddy said. ""That frog's gone. He's hopped way",no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,13,"over to the garden, by now. Maybe we'll see another one."" Roskus came with the milk buckets. He went on. Quentin wasn't coming with us. He was sitting on the kitchen steps. We went down to Versh's house. I liked to smell Versh's house. [...] 13.1 [...]There was a fire in it and T.P. squatting in his shirt tail in front of it, chunking it into a blaze. 15.1 Then I got up and T.P. dressed me and we went to the kitchen and ate. Dilsey was singing and I began to cry and she stopped. ""Keep him away from the house, now."" Dilsey said. ""We cant go that way."" T.P. said. We played in the branch. ""We cant go around yonder."" T.P. said. ""Dont you know mammy say we cant."" Dilsey was singing in the kitchen and I began to cry. ""Hush."" T.P. said. ""Come on. Les go down to the barn."" Roskus was milking at the barn. He was milking with one hand, and groaning. Some birds sat on the barn door and watched him. One of them came down and ate with the cows. I watched Roskus milk while T.P. was feeding Queenie and Prince. The calf was in the pig pen. It nuzzled at the wire, bawling. ""T.P."" Roskus said. T.P. said Sir, in the barn. Fancy held her head over the door, because T.P. hadn't fed her yet. ""Git done there."" Roskus said. ""You got to do this milking. I cant use my right hand no more."" T.P. came and milked. ""Whyn't you get the doctor."" T.P. said. ""Doctor cant do no good."" Roskus said. ""Not on this place."" ""What wrong with this place."" T.P. said. ""Taint no luck on this place."" Roskus said. ""Turn that calf in if you done."" 2.1 Taint no luck on this place, Roskus said. The fire rose and fell behind him and Versh, sliding on his and Versh's face. Dilsey finished putting me to bed. The bed smelled like T.P. I liked it. 13.2 ""What you know about it."" Dilsey said. ""What trance you been in."" ""Dont need no trance."" Roskus said. ""Aint the sign of it laying right there on that bed. Aint the sign of it been here for folks to see fifteen years now. ""Spose it is."" Dilsey said. ""It aint hurt none of you and yourn, is it. Versh working and Frony married off your hands and T.P. getting big enough to take your place when rheumatism finish getting you."" ""They been two, now."" Roskus said. ""Coing to be one more. I seen the sign, and you is too."" ""I heard a squinch owl that night."" T.P. said. ""Dan wouldn't come and get his supper, neither. Wouldn't come no closer than the barn. Begun howling right after dark. Versh heard him."" ""Going to be more than one more."" Dilsey said. ""Show me the man what aint going to die, bless Jesus."" ""Dying aint all."" Roskus said. ""I knows what you thinking."" Dilsey said. ""And they aint going to be no luck in saying that name, lessen you going to set up with him while he cries."" ""They aint no luck on this place."" Roskus said. ""I seen it at first but when they changed his name I knowed it."" ""Hush your mouth."" Dilsey said. She pulled the covers up. It smelled like T.P. ""You all shut up now, till he get to sleep."" ""I seen the sign. "" Roskus said. ""Sign T.P. got to do all your work for you."" Dilsey said. [...] 15.2 [...]Take him and Quentin down to the house and let them play with Luster, where Frony can watch them, T.P., and go and help your paw. We finished eating. T.P. took Quentin up and we went down to T.P.'s house. Luster was playing in the dirt. T.P. put Quentin down and she played in the dirt too. Luster had some spools and he and Quentin fought and Quentin had the spools. Luster cried and Frony came and gave Luster a tin can to play with, and then I had the spools and Quentin fought me and I cried. ""Hush."" Frony said. ""Aint you shamed of yourself. Taking a baby's play pretty."" She took the spools from me and gave them back to Quentin. ""Hush, now."" Frony said. ""Hush, I tell you. ""Hush up."" Frony said. ""You needs whipping, that's what you needs."" She took Luster and Quentin up. ""Come on here."" she said. We went to the barn. T.P. was milking the cow. Roskus was sitting on the box. ""What's the matter with him now."" Roskus said. ""You have to keep him down here."" Frony said. ""He fighting these babies again. Taking they play things. Stay here with T.P. now, and see can you hush a while."" ""Clean that udder good",no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,14,"now."" Roskus said. ""You milked that young cow dry last winter. If you milk this one dry, they aint going to be no more milk."" Dilsey was singing. ""Not around yonder."" T.P. said. ""Dont you know mammy say you cant go around there."" They were singing. ""Come on."" T.P. said. ""Les go play with Quentin and Luster. Come on. Quentin and Luster were playing in the dirt in front of T.P.'s house. There was a fire in the house, rising and falling, with Roskus sitting black against it. ""That's three, thank the Lawd."" Roskus said. ""I told you two years ago. They aint no luck on this place."" ""Whyn't you get out, then."" Dilsey said. She was undressing me. ""Your bad luck talk got them Memphis notions into Versh. That ought to satisfy you. ""If that all the bad luck Versh have."" Roskus said. Frony came in. ""You all done."" Dilsey said. ""T.P. finishing up."" Frony said. ""Miss Cabline want you to put Quentin to bed."" ""I'm coming just as fast as I can."" Dilsey said. ""She ought to know by this time I aint got no wings."" ""That's what I tell you."" Roskus said. ""They aint no luck going be on no place where one of they own chillen's name aint never spoke."" ""Hush."" Dilsey said. ""Do you want to get him started."" ""Raising a child not to know its own mammy's name."" Roskus said. ""Dont you bother your head about her."" Dilsey said. ""I raised all of them and I reckon I can raise one more. Hush, now. Let him get to sleep if he will."" ""Saying a name."" Frony said. ""He dont know nobody's name."" ""You just say it and see if he dont."" Dilsey said. ""You say it to him while he sleeping and I bet he hear you. ""He know lot more than folks thinks."" Roskus said. ""He knowed they time was coming, like that pointer done. He could tell you when hisn coming, if he could talk. Or yours. Or mine."" ""You take Luster outen that bed, mammy."" Frony said. ""That boy conjure him."" ""Hush your mouth."" Dilsey said. ""Aint you got no better sense than that. What you want to listen to Roskus for, anyway. Get in, Benjy."" Dilsey pushed me and I got in the bed, where Luster already was. He was asleep. Dilsey took a long piece of wood and laid it between Luster and me. ""Stay on your side now."" Dilsey said. ""Luster little, and you dont want to hurt him."" 16.1 You cant go yet, T.P. said. Wait. We looked around the corner of the house and watched the carriages go away. ""Now."" T.P. said. He took Quentin up and we ran down to the corner of the fence and watched them pass. ""There he go."" T.P. said. ""See that one with the glass in it. Look at him. He laying in there. See him."" 19.8 Come on, Luster said, I going to take this here ball down home, where I wont lose it. Naw, sir, you cant have it. If them men sees you with it, they'll say you stole it. Hush up, now. You cant have it. What business you got with it. You cant play no ball. 1.5 Frony and T.P. were playing in the dirt by the door. T.P. had lightning bugs in a bottle. ""How did you all get back out."" Frony said. ""We've got company."" Caddy said. ""Father said for us to mind me tonight. I expect you and T.P. will have to mind me too."" ""I'm not going to mind you."" Jason said. ""Frony and T.P. dont have to either.""""They will if I say so."" Caddy said. ""Maybe I wont say for them to."" ""T.P. dont mind nobody."" Frony said. ""Is they started the funeral yet."" ""What's a funeral."" Jason said. ""Didn't mammy tell you not to tell them."" Versh said. ""Where they moans."" Frony said. ""They moaned two days on Sis Beulah Clay."" 18.1 They moaned at Dilsey's house. Dilsey was moaning. When Dilsey moaned Luster said, Hush, and we hushed, and then I began to cry and Blue howled under the kitchen steps. Then Dilsey stopped and we stopped. 1.6 ""Oh."" Caddy said. ""That's niggers. White folks dont have funerals."" ""Mammy said us not to tell them, Frony."" Versh said. ""Tell them what."" Caddy said. 18.2 Dilsey moaned, and when it got to the place I began to cry and Blue howled under the steps. Luster, Frony said in the window. Take them down to the barn. I cant get no cooking done with all that racket. That hound too. Get them outen here. I aint going down there, Luster said. I might meet pappy down there. I seen him last night, waving his arms in the barn. 1.7 ""I",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,15,"like to know why not."" Frony said. ""White folks dies too. Your grandmammy dead as any nigger can get, I reckon."" ""Dogs are dead."" Caddy said. ""And when Nancy fell in the ditch and Roskus shot her and the buzzards came and undressed her."" 15.3 The bones rounded out of the ditch, where the dark vines were in the black ditch, into the moonlight, like some of the shapes had stopped. Then they all stopped and it was dark, and when I stopped to start again I could hear Mother, and feet walking fast away, and I could smell it. Then the room came, but my eyes went shut. I didn't stop. I could smell it. T.P. unpinned the bed clothes. ""Hush."" he said. ""Shhhhhhhh."" But I could smell it. T.P. pulled me up and he put on my clothes fast. ""Hush, Benjy."" he said. ""We going down to our house. You want to go down to our house, where Frony is. Hush. Shhhhh."" He laced my shoes and put my cap on and we went out. There was a light in the hall. Across the hall we could hear Mother. ""Shhhhhh, Benjy."" T.P. said. ""We'll be out in a minute."" A door opened and I could smell it more than ever, and a head came out. It wasn't Father. Father was sick there. ""Can you take him out of the house."" ""That's where we going."" T.P. said. Dilsey came up the stairs. ""Hush."" she said. ""Hush. Take him down home, T.P. Frony fixing him a bed. You all look after him, now. Hush, Benjy. Go on with T.P."" She went where we could hear Mother. ""Better keep him there."" It wasn't Father. He shut the door, but I could still smell it. We went down stairs. The stairs went down into the dark and T.P. took my hand, and we went out the door, out of the dark. Dan was sitting in the back yard, howling. ""He smell it."" T.P. said. ""Is that the way you found it out."" We went down the steps, where our shadows were. ""I forgot your coat."" T.P. said. ""You ought to had it. But I aint going back."" Dan howled. ""Hush now."" T.P. said. Our shadows moved, but Dan's shadow didn't move except to howl when he did. ""I cant take you down home, bellering like you is."" T.P. said. ""You was bad enough before you got that bullfrog voice. Come on."" We went along the brick walk, with our shadows. The pig pen smelled like pigs. The cow stood in the lot, chewing at us. Dan howled. ""You going to wake the whole town up."" T.P. said. ""Cant you hush."" We saw Fancy, eating by the branch. The moon shone on the water when we got there. ""Naw, sir."" T.P. said. ""This too close. We cant stop here. Come on. Now, just look at you. Got your whole leg wet. Come on, here."" Dan howled. The ditch came up out of the buzzing grass. The bones rounded out of the black vines. ""Now."" T.P. said. ""BelIer your head off if you want to. You got the whole night and a twenty acre pasture to belIer in."" T.P. lay down in the ditch and I sat down, watching the bones where the buzzards ate Nancy, flapping hlack and slow and heavy out of the ditch. 19.9 I had it when we was down here before, Luster said. I showed it to you. Didn't you see it. I took it out of my pocket right here and showed it to you. 1.8 ""Do you think buzzards are going to undress Damuddy."" Caddy said. ""You're crazy."" ""You're a skizzard."" Jason said. He began to cry. ""You're a knobnut."" Caddy said. Jason cried. His hands were in his pockets. ""Jason going to be rich man."" Versh said. ""He holding his money all the time."" Jason cried. ""Now you've got him started."" Caddy said. ""Hush up, Jason. How can buzzards get in where Damuddy is. Father wouldn't let them. Would you let a buzzard undress you. Hush up, now."" Jason hushed. ""Frony said it was a funeral."" he said. ""Well it's not."" Caddy said. ""It's a party. Frony dont know anything about it. He wants your lightning bugs, T.P. Let him hold it a while."" T.P. gave me the bottle of lightning bugs. ""I bet if we go around to the parlor window we can see something."" Caddy said. ""Then you'll believe me."" ""I already knows."" Frony said. ""I dont need to see. ""You better hush your mouth, Frony."" Versh said. ""Mammy going whip you."" ""What is it."" Caddy said. ""I knows what I knows."" Frony said. ""Come on."" Caddy said. ""Let's go around to the front."" We started to go. ""T P. wants his lightning bugs.""",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,16,"Frony said. ""Let him hold it a while longer, T.P."" Caddy said. ""We'll bring it back."" ""You all never caught them."" Frony said. ""If I say you and T.P. can come too, will you let him hold it."" Caddy said. ""Aint nobody said me and T.P. got to mind you."" Frony said. ""If I say you dont have to, will you let him hold it."" Caddy said. ""All right."" Frony said. ""Let him hold it, T.P. We going to watch them moaning."" ""They aint moaning."" Caddy said. ""I tell you it's a party. Are they moaning, Versh."" ""We aint going to know what they doing, standing here."" Versh said. ""Come on."" Caddy said. ""Frony and T.P. dont have to mind me. But the rest of us do. You better carry him, Versh. It's getting dark."" Versh took me up and we went on around the kitchen. 10.2 When we looked around the corner we could see the lights coming up the drive. T.P. went back to the cellar door and opened it. You know what's down there, T.P. said. Soda water. I seen Mr Jason come up with both hands full of them. Wait here a minute. T.P. went and looked in the kitchen door. Dilsey said, What are you peeping in here for. Where's Benjy. He out here, T.P. said. Go on and watch him, Dilsey said. Keep him out the house now. Yessum, T.P. said. Is they started yet. You go on and keep that boy out of sight, Dilsey said. I got all I can tend to. 1.9 A snake crawled out from under the house. Jason said he wasn't afraid of snakes and Caddy said he was but she wasn't and Versh said they both were and Caddy said to be quiet, like Father said. 10.3 You aint got to start bellering now, T.P. said. You want some this sassprilluh. It tickled my nose and eyes. If you aint going to drink it, let me get to it, T.P. said. All right, here tis. We better get another bottle while aint nobody bothering us. You be quiet, now. We stopped under the tree by the parlor window. Versh set me down in the wet grass. It was cold. There were lights in all the windows. 1.10 ""That's where Damuddy is."" Caddy said. ""She's sick every day now. When she gets well we're going to have a picnic."" ""I knows what I knows."" Frony said. The trees were buzzing, and the grass. ""The one next to it is where we have the measles."" Caddy said. ""Where do you and T.P. have the measles, Frony."" ""Has them just wherever we is, I reckon."" Frony said. ""They haven't started yet."" Caddy said. 10.4 They getting ready to start, T.P. said. You stand right here now while I get that box so we can see in the window. Here, les finish drinking this here sassprilluh. It make me feel just like a squinch owl inside. We drank the sassprilluh and T.P. pushed the bottle through the lattice, under the house, and went away. I could hear them in the parlor and I clawed my hands against the wall. T.P. dragged the box. He fell down, and he began to laugh. He lay there, laughing into the grass. He got up and dragged the box under the window, trying not to laugh. ""I skeered I going to holler."" T.P. said. ""Git on the box and see is they started."" 1.11 ""They haven't started because the band hasn't come yet."" Caddy said. ""They aint going to have no band."" Frony said. ""How do you know."" Caddy said. ""I knows what I knows."" Frony said. ""You dont know anything."" Caddy said. She went to the tree. ""Push me up, Versh."" ""Your paw told you to stay out that tree."" Versh said. ""That was a long time ago."" Caddy said. ""I expect he's forgotten about it. Besides, he said to mind me tonight. Didn't he didn't he say to mind me tonight."" ""I'm not going to mind you."" Jason said. ""Frony and T.P. are not going to either."" ""Push me up, Versh."" Caddy said. ""All right."" Versh said. ""You the one going to get whipped. I aint."" He went and pushed Caddy up into the tree to the first limb. We watched the muddy bottom of her drawers. Then we couldn't see her. We could hear the tree thrashing. ""Mr Jason said if you break that tree he whip you."" Versh said. ""I'm going to tell on her too."" Jason said. The tree quit thrashing. We looked up into the still branches. ""What you seeing."" Frony whispered. 10.5 I saw them. Then I saw Caddy, with flowers in her hair, and a long veil like shining wind. Caddy Caddy ""Hush."" T.P. said. ""They going",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,17,"to hear you. Get down quick."" He pulled me. Caddy. I clawed my hands against the wall Caddy. T.P. pulled me. ""Hush."" he said. ""Hush. Come on here quick."" He pulled me on. Caddy ""Hush up, Benjy. You want them to hear you. Come on, les drink some more sassprilluh, then we can come back if you hush. We better get one more bottle or we both be hollering. We can say Dan drank it. Mr Quentin always saying he so smart, we can say he sassprilluh dog, too."" The moonlight came down the cellar stairs. We drank some more sassprilluh. ""You know what I wish."" T.P. said. ""I wish a bear would walk in that cellar door. You know what I do. I walk right up to him and spit in he eye. Gimme that bottle to stop my mouth before I holler."" T.P. fell down. He began to laugh, and the cellar door and the moonlight jumped away and something hit me. ""Hush up."" T.P. said, trying not to laugh. ""Lawd, they'll all hear us. Get up."" T.P. said. ""Get up, Benjy, quick."" He was thrashing about and laughing and I tried to get up. The cellar steps ran up the hill in the moonlight and T.P. fell up the hill, into the moonlight, and I ran against the fence and T.P. ran behind me saying ""Hush up hush up."" Then he fell into the flowers, laughing, and I ran into the box. But when I tried to climb onto it it jumped away and hit me on the back of the head and my throat made a sound. It made the sound again and I stopped trying to get up, and it made the sound again and I began to cry. But my throat kept on making the sound while T.P. was pulling me. It kept on making it and I couldn't tell if I was crying or not, and T.P. fell down on top of me, laughing, and it kept on making the sound and Quentin kicked T.P. and Caddy put her arms around me, and her shining veil, and I couldn't smell trees anymore and I began to cry. 6.1 Benjy, Caddy said, Benjy. She put her arms around me again, but I went away. ""What is it, Benjy."" she said. ""Is it this hat."" She took her hat off and came again, and I went away. ""Benjy."" she said. ""What is it, Benjy. What has Caddy done."" ""He dont like that prissy dress."" Jason said. ""You think you're grown up, dont you. You think you're better than anybody else, dont you. Prissy."" ""You shut your mouth."" Caddy said. ""You dirty little beast. Benjy."" ""Just because you are fourteen, you think you're grown up, dont you."" Jason said. ""You think you're something. Dont you."" ""Hush, Benjy."" Caddy said. ""You'll disturb Mother. Hush."" But I didn't hush, and when she went away I followed, and she stopped on the stairs and waited and I stopped too. ""What is it, Benjy."" Caddy said. ""Tell Caddy. She'll do it. Try."" ""Candace."" Mother said. ""Yessum."" Caddy said. ""Why are you teasing him."" Mother said. ""Bring him here."" We went to Mother's room, where she was lying with the sickness on a cloth on her head. ""What is the matter now."" Mother said. ""Benjamin. ""Benjy."" Caddy said. She came again, but I went away. ""You must have done something to him."" Mother said. ""Why wont you let him alone, so I can have some peace. Give him the box and please go on and let him alone."" Caddy got the box and set it on the floor and opened it. It was full of stars. When I was still, they were still. When I moved, they glinted and sparkled. I hushed. Then I heard Caddy walking and I began again. ""Benjamin."" Mother said. ""Come here."" I went to the door. ""You, Benjamin."" Mother said. ""What is it now."" Father said. ""Where are you going."" ""Take him downstairs and get someone to watch him, Jason."" Mother said. ""You know I'm ill, yet you "" Father shut the door behind us. ""T.P."" he said. ""Sir."" T.P. said downstairs. ""Benjy's coming down."" Father said. ""Go with T.P."" I went to the bathroom door. I could hear the water. ""Benjy."" T.P. said downstairs. I could hear the water. I listened to it. ""Benjy."" T.P. said downstairs.I listened to the water. I couldn't hear the water, and Caddy opened the door. ""Why, Benjy."" she said. She looked at me and I went and she put her arms around me. ""Did you find Caddy again."" she said. ""Did you think Caddy had run away."" Caddy smelled like trees. We went to Caddy's room. She sat down at the mirror. She stopped her hands and looked at",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,18,"me. ""Why, Benjy. What is it."" she said. ""You mustn't cry. Caddy's not going away. See here."" she said. She took up the bottle and took the stopper out and held it to my nose. ""Sweet. Smell. Good."" I went away and I didn't hush, and she held the bottle in her hand, looking at me. ""Oh."" she said. She put the bottle down and came and put her arms around me. ""So that was it. And you were trying to tell Caddy and you couldn't tell her. You wanted to, but you couldn't, could you. Of course Caddy wont. Of course Caddy wont. Just wait till I dress."" Caddy dressed and took up the bottle again and we went down to the kitchen. ""Dilsey."" Caddy said. ""Benjy's got a present for you."" She stooped down and pot the bottle in my hand. ""Hold it out to Dilsey, now."" Caddy held my hand out and Dilsey took the bottle. ""Well I'll declare."" Dilsey said. ""If my baby aint give Dilsey a bottle of perfume. Just look here, Roskus."" Caddy smelled like trees. ""We dont like perfume ourselves."" Caddy said. 1.12 She smelled like trees. 8.1 ""Come on, now."" Dilsey said. ""You too big to sleep with folks. You a big boy now. Thirteen years old. Big enough to sleep by yourself in Uncle Maury's room."" Dilsey said. Uncle Maury was sick. His eye was sick, and his mouth. Versh took his supper up to him on the tray. ""Maury says he's going to shoot the scoundrel."" Father said. ""I told him he'd better not mention it to Patterson before hand."" He drank. ""Jason."" Mother said. ""Shoot who, Father."" Quentin said. ""What's Uncle Maury going to shoot him for."" ""Because he couldn't take a little joke."" Father said. ""Jason."" Mother said. ""How can you. You'd sit right there and see Maury shot down in ambush, and laugh."" ""Then Maury'd better stay out of ambush."" Father said. ""Shoot who, Father."" Quentin said. ""Who's Uncle Maury going to shoot."" ""Nobody."" Father said. ""I dont own a pistol."" Mother began to cry. ""If you begrudge Maury your food, why aren't you man enough to say so to his face. To ridicule him before the children, behind his back."" ""Of course I dont."" Father said. ""I admire Maury. He is invaluable to my own sense of racial superiority. I wouldn't swap Maury for a matched team. And do you know why, Quentin."" ""No, sir."" Quentin said. ""Et ego in arcadia I have forgotten the latin for hay."" Father said. ""There, there."" he said. ""I was just joking."" He drank and set the glass down and went and put his hand on Mother's shoulder. ""It's no joke."" Mother said. ""My people are every bit as well born as yours. Just because Maury's health is bad. ""Of course."" Father said. ""Bad health is the primary reason for all life. Created by disease, within putrefaction, into decay. Versh."" ""Sir."" Versh said behind my chair. ""Take the decanter and fill it."" ""And tell Dilsey to come and take Benjamin up to bed."" Mother said. ""You a big boy."" Dilsey said. ""Caddy tired sleeping with you. Hush now, so you can go to sleep."" The room went away, but I didn't hush, and the room came back and Dilsey came and sat on the bed, looking at me. ""Aint you going to be a good boy and hush."" Dilsey said. ""You aint, is you. Sec can you wait a minute, then."" She went away. There wasn't anything in the door. Then Caddy was in it. ""Hush."" Caddy said. ""I'm coming."" I hushed and Dilsey turned back the spread and Caddy got in between the spread and the blanket. She didn't take off her bathrobe. ""Now."" she said. ""Here I am."" Dilsey came with a blanket and spread it over her and tucked it around her. ""He be gone in a minute."" Dilsey said. ""I leave the light on in your room. ""All right."" Caddy said. She snuggled her head beside mine on the pillow. ""Goodnight, Dilsey."" ""Goodnight, honey."" Dilsey said. The room went black. Caddy smelled like trees. 1.13 We looked up into the tree where she was. ""What she seeing, Versh."" Frony whispered. ""Shhhhhhh."" Caddy said in the tree. Dilsey said, ""You come on here."" She came around the corner of the house. ""Whyn't you all go on up stairs, like your paw said, stead of slipping out behind my back. Where's Caddy and Quentin."" ""I told her not to climb up that tree."" Jason said. ""I'm going to tell on her. ""Who in what tree."" Dilsey said. She came and looked up into the tree. ""Caddy."" Dilsey said. The branches began to shake again. ""You, Satan."" Dilsey said. ""Come down from there."" ""Hush."" Caddy said, ""Dont you know",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,19,"Father said to be quiet."" Her legs came in sight and Dilsey reached up and lifted her out of the tree. ""Aint you got any better sense than to let them come around here."" Dilsey said. ""I couldn't do nothing with her."" Versh said. ""What you all doing here."" Dilsey said. ""Who told you to come up to the house."" ""She did."" Frony said. ""She told us to come."" ""Who told you you got to do what she say."" Dilsey said. ""Get on home, now.' Frony and T.P. went on. We couldn't see them when they were still going away. ""Out here in the middle of the night."" Dilsey said. She took me up and we went to the kitchen. ""Slipping out behind my back."" Dilsey said. ""When you knowed it's past your bedtime."" ""Shhhh, Dilsey."" Caddy said. ""Dont talk so loud. We've got to be quiet."" ""You hush your mouth and get quiet, then."" Dilsey said. ""Where's Quentin."" ""Quentin's mad because we had to mind me tonight."" Caddy said. ""He's still got T.P.'s bottle of lightning bugs."" ""I reckon T.P. can get along without it."" Dilsey said. ""You go and find Quentin, Versh. Roskus say he seen him going towards the barn."" Versh went on. We couldn't see him. ""They're not doing anything in there."" Caddy said. ""Just sitting in chairs and looking."" ""They dont need no help from you all to do that."" Dilsey said. We went around the kitchen. 19.10 Where you want to go now, Luster said. You going back to watch them knocking ball again. We done looked for it over there. Here. Wait a minute. You wait right here while I go back and get that ball. I done thought of something. 7.1 The kitchen was dark. The trees were black on the sky. Dan came waddling out from under the steps and chewed my ankle. I went around the kitchen, where the moon was. Dan came scuffling along, into the moon. ""Benjy."" T.P. said in the house. The flower tree by the parlor window wasn't dark, but the thick trees were. The grass was buzzing in the moonlight where my shadow walked on the grass. ""You, Benjy."" T.P. said in the house. ""Where you hiding. You slipping off. I knows it."" 19.11 Luster came back. Wait, he said. Here. Dont go over there. Miss Quentin and her beau in the swing yonder. You come on this way. Come back here, Benjy. 7.2 It was dark under the trees. Dan wouldn't come. He stayed in the moonlight. Then I could see the swing and I began to cry. 19.12 Come away from there, Benjy, Luster said. You know Miss Quentin going to get mad. 7.3 It was two now, and then one in the swing. Caddy came fast, white in the darkness. ""Benjy."" she said. ""How did you slip out. Where's Versh."" She put her arms around me and I hushed and held to her dress and tried to pull her away. ""Why, Benjy."" she said. ""What is it. T.P."" she called. The one in the swing got up and came, and I cried and pulled Caddy's dress. ""Benjy."" Caddy said. ""It's just Charlie. Dont you know Charlie."" ""Where's his nigger."" Charlie said. ""What do they let him run around loose for."" ""Hush, Benjy."" Caddy said. ""Go away, Charlie. He doesn't like you."" Charlie went away and I hushed. I pulled at Caddy's dress. ""Why, Benjy."" Caddy said. ""Aren't you going to let me stay here and talk to Charlie a while."" ""Call that nigger."" Charlie said. He came back. I cried louder and pulled at Caddy's dress. ""Go away, Charlie."" Caddy said. Charlie came and put his hands on Caddy and I cried more. I cried loud. ""No, no."" Caddy said. ""No. No."" ""He cant talk."" Charlie said. ""Caddy."" ""Are you crazy."" Caddy said. She began to breathe fast. ""He can see. Dont. Dont."" Caddy fought. They both breathed fast. ""Please. Please."" Caddy whispered. ""Send him away."" Charlie said. ""I will."" Caddy said. ""Let me go."" ""Will you send him away."" Charlie said. ""Yes."" Caddy said. ""Let me go."" Charlie went away. ""Hush."" Caddy said. ""He's gone."" I hushed. I could hear her and feel her chest going. ""I'll have to take him to the house."" she said. She took my hand. ""I'm coming."" she whispered. ""Wait."" Charlie said. ""Call the nigger."" ""No."" Caddy said. ""I'll come back. Come on, Benjy."" ""Caddy."" Charlie whispered, loud. We went on. ""You better come back. Are you coming back."" Caddy and I were running. ""Caddy."" Charlie said. We ran out into the moonlight, toward the kitchen. ""Caddy."" Charlie said. Caddy and I ran. We ran up the kitchen steps, onto the porch, and Caddy knelt down in the dark and held me. I could hear her",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,20,"and feel her chest. ""I wont."" she said. ""I wont anymore, ever. Benjy. Benjy.' Then she was crying, and I cried, and we held each other. ""Hush."" She said. ""Hush. I wont anymore. So I hushed and Caddy got up and we went into the kitchen and turned the light on and Caddy took the kitchen soap and washed her mouth at the sink, hard. Caddy smelled like trees. 19.13 I kept a telling you to stay away from there, Luster said. They sat up in the swing, quick. Quentin had her hands on her hair. He had a red tie. You old crazy loon, Quentin said. I'm going to tell Dilsey about the way you let him follow everywhere I go. I'm going to make her whip you good. ""I couldn't stop him."" Luster said. ""Come on here, Benjy."" ""Yes you could."" Quentin said. ""You didn't try. You were both snooping around after me. Did Grandmother send you all out here to spy on me."" She jumped out of the swing. ""If you dont take him right away this minute and keep him away, I'm going to make Jason whip you."" ""I cant do nothing with him."" Luster said. ""You try it if you think you can."" ""Shut your mouth."" Quentin said. ""Are you going to get him away."" ""Ah, let him stay."" he said. He had a red tie. The sun was red on it. ""Look here, Jack."" He struck a match and put it in his mouth. Then he took the match out of his mouth. It was still burning. ""Want to try it."" he said. I went over there. ""Open your mouth."" he said. I opened my mouth. Quentin hit the match with her hand and it went away. ""Goddam you."" Quentin said. ""Do you want to get him started. Dont You know he'll beller all day. I'm going to tell Dilsey on you."" She went away running. ""Here, kid."" he said. ""Hey. Come on back. I aint going to fool with him."" Quentin ran on to the house. She went around the kitchen. ""You played hell then, Jack."" he said. ""Aint you."" ""He cant tell what you saying."" Luster said. ""He deef and dumb."" ""Is."" he said. ""How long's he been that way."" ""Been that way thirty three years today."" Luster said. ""Born looney. Is you one of them show folks."" ""Why."" he said. ""I dont ricklick seeing you around here before."" Luster said. ""Well, what about it."" he said. ""Nothing."" Luster said. ""I going tonight."" He looked at me. ""You aint the one can play a tune on that saw, is you."" Luster said. ""It'll cost you a quarter to find that out."" he said. He looked at me. ""Why dont they lock him up."" he said. ""What'd you bring him out here for."" ""You aint talking to me."" Luster said. ""I cant do nothing with him. I just come over here looking for a quarter I lost so I can go to the show tonight. Look like now I aint going to get to go."" Luster looked on the ground. ""You aint got no extra quarter, is you."" Luster said. ""No."" he said. ""I aint."" ""I reckon I just have to find that other one, then."" Luster said. He put his hand in his pocket. ""You dont want to buy no golf ball neither, does you."" Luster said. ""What kind of ball."" he said. ""Golf ball."" Luster said. ""I dont want but a quarter."" ""What for."" he said. ""What do I want with it."" ""I didn't think you did."" Luster said. ""Come on here, mulehead."" He said. ""Come on here and watch them knocking that ball. Here. Here something you can play with along with that jimson weed."" Luster picked it up and gave it to me. It was bright. ""Where'd you get that."" he said. His tie was red in the sun, walking. ""Found it under this here bush."" Luster said. ""I thought for a minute it was that quarter I lost."" He came and took it. ""Hush."" Luster said. ""He going to give it back when he done looking at it."" ""Agnes Mabel Becky."" he said. He looked toward the house. ""Hush."" Luster said. ""He fixing to give it back."" He gave it to me and I hushed. ""Who come to see her last night."" he said. ""I dont know."" Luster said. ""They comes every night she can climb down that tree. I dont keep no track of them."" ""Damn if one of them didn't leave a track."" he said. He looked at the house. Then he went and lay down in the swing. ""Go away."" he said. ""Dont bother me."" ""Come on here."" Luster said. ""You done played hell now. Time Miss Quentin get done telling on you."" We went",no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,21,"to the fence and looked through the curling flower spaces. Luster hunted in the grass. ""I had it right here."" he said. I saw the flag flapping, and the sun slanting on the broad grass. ""They'll be some along soon."" Luster said. ""There some now, but they going away. Come on and help me look for it."" We went along the fence. ""Hush."" Luster said. ""How can I make them come over here, if they aint coming. Wait. They'll be some in a minute. Look yonder. Here they come."" I went along the fence, to the gate, where the girls passed with their booksatchels. ""You, Benjy."" Luster said. ""Come back here."" 11.1 You cant do no good looking through the gate, T.P. said. Miss Caddy done gone long ways away. Done got married and left you. You cant do no good, holding to the gate and crying. She cant hear you. What is it he wants, T.P. Mother said. Cant you play with him and keep him quiet. He want to go down yonder and look through the gate, T.P. said. Well, he cannot do it, Mother said. It's raining. You will just have to play with him and keep him quiet. You, Benjamin. Aint nothing going to quiet him, T.P. said. He think if he down to the gate, Miss Caddy come back. Nonsense, Mother said. 12.1 I could hear them talking. I went out the door and I couldn't hear them, and I went down to the gate, where the girls passed with their booksatchels. They looked at me, walking fast, with their heads turned. I tried to say, but they went on, and I went along the fence, trying to say, and they went faster. Then they were running and I came to the corner of the fence and I couldn't go any further, and I held to the fence, looking after them and trying to say. ""You, Benjy."" T.P. said. ""What you doing, slipping out. Dont you know Dilsey whip you."" ""You cant do no good, moaning and slobbering through the fence."" T.P. said. ""You done skeered them chillen. Look at them, walking on the other side of the street."" 14.1 How did he get out, Father said. Did you leave the gate unlatched when you came in, Jason. Of course not, Jason said. Dont you know I've got better sense than to do that. Do you think I wanted anything like this to happen. This family is bad enough, God knows. I could have told you, all the time. I reckon you'll send him to Jackson, now. If Mr Burgess dont shoot him first. Hush, Father said. I could have told you, all the time, Jason said. 14.2 It was open when I touched it, and I held to it in the twilight. I wasn't crying, and I tried to stop, watching the girls coming along in the twilight. I wasn't crying. ""There he is."" They stopped. ""He cant get out. He wont hurt anybody, anyway. Come on."" ""I'm scared to. I'm scared. I'm going to cross the street."" ""He cant get out."" I wasn't crying. ""Dont be a fraid cat. Come on."" They came on in the twilight. I wasn't crying, and I held to the gate. They came slow. ""I'm scared."" ""He wont hurt you. I pass here every day. He just runs along the fence."" They came on. I opened the gate and they stopped, turning. I was trying to say, and I caught her, trying to say, and she screamed and I was trying to say and trying arid the bright shapes began to stop and I tried to get out. I tried to get it off of my face, but the bright shapes were going again. They were going up the hill to where it fell away and I tried to cry. But when I breathed in, I couldn't breathe out again to cry, and I tried to keep from falling off the hill and I fell off the hill into the bright, whirling shapes. 19.14 Here, looney, Luster said. Here come some. Hush your slobbering and moaning, now. They came to the flag. He took it out and they hit, then he put the flag back. ""Mister."" Luster said. He looked around. ""What."" he said. ""Want to buy a golf ball."" Luster said. ""Let's see it."" he said. He came to the fence and Luster reached the ball through. ""Where'd you get it."" he said. ""Found it."" Luster said. ""I know that."" he said. ""Where. In somebody's golf bag."" ""I found it laying over here in the yard."" Luster said. ""I'll take a quarter for it."" ""What makes you think it's yours."" he said. ""I found it."" Luster said. ""Then find yourself another one."" he said. He put it",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,22,"in his pocket and went away. ""I got to go to that show tonight."" Luster said. ""That so. "" he said. He went to the table. ""Fore caddie."" he said. He hit. ""I'll declare."" Luster said. ""You fusses when you dont see them and you fusses when you does. Why cant you hush. Dont you reckon folks gets tired of listening to you all the time. Here. You dropped your jimson weed."" He picked it up and gave it back to me. ""You needs a new one. You bout wore that one out."" We stood at the fence and watched them. ""That white man hard to get along with."" Luster said. ""You see him take my ball."" They went on. We went on along the fence. We came to the garden and we couldn't go any further. I held to the fence and looked through the flower spaces. They went away. ""Now you aint got nothing to moan about."" Luster said. ""Hush up. I the one got something to moan over, you aint. Here. Whyn't you hold on to that weed. You be bellering about it next."" He gave me the flower. ""Where you heading now. Our shadows were on the grass. They got to the trees before we did. Mine got there first. Then we got there, and then the shadows were gone. There was a flower in the bottle. I put the other flower in it. ""Aint you a grown man, now. Luster said. ""Playing with two weeds in a bottle. You know what they going to do with you when Miss Cahline die. They going to send you to Jackson, where you belong. Mr Jason say so. Where you can hold the bars all day long with the rest of the looneys and slobber. How you like that."" Luster knocked the flowers over with his hand. ""That's what they'll do to you at Jackson when you starts bellering."" I tried to pick up the flowers. Luster picked them up, and they went away. I began to cry. ""Beller."" Luster said. ""Beller. You want something to beller about. All right, then. Caddy."" he whispered. ""Caddy. Beller now. Caddy."" ""Luster."" Dilsey said from the kitchen. The flowers came back. ""Hush."" Luster said. ""Here they is. Look. It's fixed back just like it was at first. Hush, now."" ""You, Luster."" Dilsey said. ""Yessum."" Luster said. ""We coming. You done played hell. Get up."" He jerked my arm and I got up. We went out of the trees. Our shadows were gone. ""Hush."" Luster said. ""Look at all them folks watching you. Hush."" ""You bring him on here."" Dilsey said. She came down the steps. ""What you done to him now."" she said. ""Aint done nothing to him."" Luster said. ""He just started bellering."" ""Yes you is."" Dilsey said. ""You done something to him. Where you been."" ""Over yonder under them cedars."" Luster said. ""Getting Quentin all riled up."" Dilsey said. ""Why cant you keep him away from her. Dont you know she dont like him where she at."" ""Got as much time for him as I is."" Luster said. ""He aint none of my uncle."" ""Dont you sass me, nigger boy."" Dilsey said. ""I aint done nothing to him."" Luster said. ""He was playing there, and all of a sudden he started bellering."" ""Is you been projecking with his graveyard."" Dilsey said. ""I aint touched his graveyard."" Luster said. ""Dont lie to me, boy."" Dilsey said. We went up the steps and into the kitchen. Dilsey opened the firedoor and drew a chair up in front of it and I sat down. I hushed. 2.2 What you want to get her started for, Dilsey said. Whyn't you keep him out of there. He was just looking at the fire, Caddy said. Mother was telling him his new name. We didn't mean to get her started. I knows you didn't, Dilsey said. Him at one end of the house and her at the other. You let my things alone, now. Dont you touch nothing till I get back. 19.15 ""Aint you shamed of yourself."" Dilsey said. ""Teasing him."" She set the cake on the table. ""I aint been teasing him."" Luster said. ""He was playing with that bottle full of dogfennel and all of a sudden he started up bellering. You heard him."" ""You aint done nothing to his flowers."" Dilsey said. ""I aint touched his graveyard."" Luster said. ""What I want with his truck. I was just hunting for that quarter."" ""You lost it, did you."" Dilsey said. She lit the candles on the cake. Some of them were little ones. Some were big ones cut into little pieces. ""I told you to go put it away. Now I reckon you want me to get you another one from Frony.""",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,23,"""I got to go to that show, Benjy or no Benjy."" Luster said. ""I aint going to follow him around day and night both."" ""You going to do just what he want you to, nigger boy."" Dilsey said. ""You hear me."" ""Aint I always done it."" Luster said. ""Dont I always does what he wants. Dont I, Benjy."" ""Then you keep it up."" Dilsey said. ""Bringing him in here, bawling and getting her started too. You all go ahead and eat this cake, now, before Jason come. I dont want him jumping on me about a cake I bought with my own money. Me baking a cake here, with him counting every egg that comes into this kitchen. See can you let him alone now, less you dont want to go to that show tonight."" Dilsey went away. ""You cant blow out no candles."" Luster said. ""Watch me blow them out."" He leaned down and puffed his face. The candles went away. I began to cry. ""Hush."" Luster said. ""Here. Look at the fire whiles I cuts this cake."" 2.3 I could hear the clock, and I could hear Caddy standing behind me, and I could hear the roof It's still raining, Caddy said. I hate rain. I hate everything. And then her head came into my lap and she was crying, holding me, and I began to cry. Then I looked at the fire again and the bright, smooth shapes went again. I could hear the clock and the roof and Caddy. 19.16 I ate some cake. Luster's hand came and took another piece. I could hear him eating. I looked at the fire. A long piece of wire came across my shoulder. It went to the door, and then the fire went away. I began to cry. ""What you howling for now."" Luster said. ""Look there."" The fire was there. I hushed. ""Cant you set and look at the fire and be quiet like mammy told you."" Luster said. ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Here. Here's you some more cake."" ""What you done to him now."" Dilsey said. ""Cant you never let him alone."" ""I was just trying to get him to hush up and not sturb Miss Cahline."" Luster said. ""Something got him started again."" ""And I know what that something name."" Dilsey said. ""I'm going to get Versh to take a stick to you when he comes home. You just trying yourself. You been doing it all day. Did you take him down to the branch."" ""Nome."" Luster said. ""We been right here in this yard all day, like you said."" His hand came for another piece of cake. Dilsey hit his hand. ""Reach it again, and I chop it right off with this here butcher knife."" Dilsey said. ""I bet he aint had one piece of it."" ""Yes he is."" Luster said. ""He already had twice as much as me. Ask him if he aint."" ""Reach hit one more time."" Dilsey said. ""Just reach it."" 2.4 That's right, Dilsey said. I reckon it'll be my time to cry next. Reckon Maury going to let me cry on him a while, too. His name's Benjy now, Caddy said. How come it is, Dilsey said. He aint wore out the name he was born with yet, is he. Benjamin came out of the bible, Caddy said. It's a better name for him than Maury was. How come it is, Dilsey said. Mother says it is, Caddy said. Huh, Dilsey said. Name aint going to help him. Hurt him, neither. Folks dont have no luck, changing names. My name been Dilsey since fore I could remember and it be Dilsey when they's long forgot me. How will they know it's Dilsey, when it's long forgot, Dilsey, Caddy said. It'll be in the Book, honey, Dilsey said. Writ out. Can you read it, Caddy said. Wont have to, Dilsey said. They'll read it for me. All I got to do is say Ise here. 19.17 The long wire came across my shoulder, and the fire went away. I began to cry. Dilsey and Luster fought. ""I seen you."" Dilsey said. ""Oho, I seen you."" She dragged Luster out of the corner, shaking him. ""Wasn't nothing bothering him, was they. You just wait till your pappy come home. I wish I was young like I use to be, I'd tear them years right off your head. I good mind to lock you up in that cellar and not let you go to that show tonight, I sho is."" ""Ow, mammy."" Luster said. ""Ow, mammy. I put my hand out to where the fire had been. ""Catch him."" Dilsey said. ""Catch him back."" My hand jerked back and I put it in my mouth and Dilsey caught me. I",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,24,"could still hear the clock between my voice. Dilsey reached back and hit Luster on the head. My voice was going loud every time. ""Get that soda."" Dilsey said. She took my hand out of my mouth. My voice went louder then and my hand tried to go back to my mouth, but Dilsey held it. My voice went loud. She sprinkled soda on my hand. ""Look in the pantry and tear a piece off of that rag hanging on the nail."" she said. ""Hush, now. You dont want to make your maw sick again, does you. Here, look at the fire. Dilsey make your hand stop hurting in just a minute. Look at the fire."" She opened the fire door. I looked at the fire, but my hand didn't stop and I didn't stop. My hand was trying to go to my mouth, but Dilsey held it. She wrapped the cloth around it. Mother said, ""What is it now. Cant I even be sick in peace. Do I have to get up out of bed to come down to him, with two grown negroes to take care of him."" ""He all right now."" Dilsey said. ""He going to quit. He just burnt his hand a little."" ""With two grown negroes, you must bring him into the house, bawling."" Mother said. ""You got him started on purpose, because you know I'm sick."" She came and stood by me. ""Hush."" she said. ""Right this minute. Did you give him this cake."" ""I bought it."" Dilsey said. ""It never come out of Jason's pantry. I fixed him some birthday."" ""Do you want to poison him with that cheap store cake."" Mother said. ""Is that what you are trying to do. Am I never to have one minute's peace."" ""You go on back up stairs and lay down."" Dilsey said. ""It'll quit smarting him in a minute now, and he'll hush. Come on, now."" ""And leave him down here for you all to do something else to."" Mother said. ""How can I lie there, with him bawling down here. Benjamin. Hush this minute."" ""They aint nowhere else to take him."" Dilsey said. ""We aint got the room we use to have. He cant stay out in the yard, crying where all the neighbors can see him."" ""I know, I know."" Mother said. ""It's all my fault. I'll be gone soon, and you and Jason will both get along better."" She began to cry. ""You hush that, now."" Dilsey said. ""You'll get yourself down again. You come on back up stairs. Luster going to take him to the liberry and play with him till I get his supper done."" Dilsey and Mother went out. ""Hush up."" Luster said. ""You hush up. You want me to burn your other hand for you. You aint hurt. Hush up."" ""Here."" Dilsey said. ""Stop crying, now."" She gave me the slipper, and I hushed. ""Take him to the liberry."" she said. ""And if I hear him again, I going to whip you myself."" We went to the library. Luster turned on the light. The windows went black, and the dark tall place on the wall came and I went and touched it. It was like a door, only it wasn't a door. The fire came behind me and I went to the fire and sat on the floor, holding the slipper. The fire went higher. It went onto the cushion in Mother's chair. ""Hush up."" Luster said. ""Cant you never get done for a while. Here I done built you a fire, and you wont even look at it."" 2.5 Your name is Benjy, Caddy said. Do you hear. Benjy. Benjy. Dont tell him that, Mother said. Bring him here. Caddy lifted me under the arms. Get up, Mau I mean Benjy, she said. Dont try to carry him, Mother said. Cant you lead him over here. Is that too much for you to think of. I can carry him, [...] 1.14 Caddy said. ""Let me carry him up, Dilsey."" ""Go on, Minute."" Dilsey said. ""You aint big enough to tote a flea. You go on and be quiet, like Mr Jason said."" There was a light at the top of the stairs. Father was there, in his shirt sleeves. The way he looked said Hush. Caddy whispered, ""Is Mother sick."" 2.6 Versh set me down and we went into Mother's room. There was a fire. It was rising and falling on the walls. There was another fire in the mirror, I could smell the sickness. It was on a cloth folded on Mother's head. Her hair was on the pillow. The fire didn't reach it, but it shone on her hand, where her rings were jumping. ""Come and tell Mother goodnight."" Caddy said. We went to the",no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,25,"bed. The fire went out of the mirror. Father got up from the bed and lifted me up and Mother put her hand on my head. ""What time is it."" Mother said. Her eyes were closed. ""Ten minutes to seven."" Father said. ""It's too early for him to go to bed."" Mother said. ""He'll wake up at daybreak, and I simply cannot bear another day like today."" ""There, there."" Father said. He touched Mother's face. ""I know I'm nothing but a burden to you. Mother said. ""But I'll be gone soon. Then you will be rid of my bothering."" ""Hush."" Father said. ""I'll take him downstairs a while."" He took me up. ""Come on, old fellow. Let's go down stairs a while. We'll have to be quiet while Quentin is studying, now. Caddy went and leaned her face over the bed and Mother's hand came into the firelight. Her rings jumped on Caddy's back. 1.15 Mother's sick, Father said. Dilsey will put you to bed. Where's Quentin. Versh getting him, Dilsey said. Father stood and watched us go past. We could hear Mother in her room. Caddy said ""Hush."" Jason was still climbing the stairs. He had his hands in his pockets. ""You all must be good tonight."" Father said. ""And be quiet, so you wont disturb Mother."" ""We'll be quiet."" Caddy said. ""You must be quiet now, Jason."" She said. We tiptoed. 2.7 We could hear the roof. I could see the fire in the mirror too. Caddy lifted me again. ""Come on, now."" she said. ""Then you can come back to the fire. Hush, now."" ""Candace."" Mother said. ""Hush, Benjy."" Caddy said. ""Mother wants you a minute. Like a good boy. Then you can come back. Benjy."" Caddy let me down, and I hushed. ""Let him stay here, Mother. When he's through looking at the fire, then you can tell him."" ""Candace."" Mother said. Caddy stooped and lifted me. We staggered. ""Candace."" Mother said. ""Hush."" Caddy said. ""You can still see it. Hush."" ""Bring him here."" Mother said. ""He's too big for you to carry. You must stop trying. You'll injure your back. All of our women have prided themselves on their carriage. Do you want to look like a washerwoman."" ""He's not too heavy."" Caddy said. ""I can carry him."" ""Well, I dont want him carried, then."" Mother said. ""A five year old child. No, no. Not in my lap. Let him stand up."" ""If you'll hold him, he'll stop."" Caddy said. ""Hush."" she said. ""You can go right back. Here. Here's your cushion. See."" ""Dont, Candace."" Mother said. ""Let him look at it and he'll be quiet."" Caddy said. ""Hold up just a minute while I slip it out. There, Benjy. Look."" I looked at it and hushed. ""You humor him too much."" Mother said. ""You and your father both. You dont realise that I am the one who has to pay for it. Damuddy spoiled Jason that way and it took him two years to outgrow it, and I am not strong enough to go through the same thing with Benjamin."" ""You dont need to bother with him."" Caddy said. ""I like to take care of him. Dont I. Benjy. ""Candace."" Mother said. ""I told you not to call him that. It was bad enough when your father insisted on calling you by that silly nickname, and I will not have him called by one. Nicknames are vulgar. Only common people use them. Benjamin."" she said. ""Look at me."" Mother said. ""Benjamin."" she said. She took my face in her hands and turned it to hers. ""Benjamin."" she said. ""Take that cushion away, Candace."" ""He'll cry."" Caddy said. ""Take that cushion away, like I told you."" Mother said. ""He must learn to mind."" The cushion went away. ""Hush, Benjy."" Caddy said. ""You go over there and sit down."" Mother said. ""Benjamin."" She held my face to hers. ""Stop that."" she said. ""Stop it."" But I didn't stop and Mother caught me in her arms and began to cry, and I cried. Then the cushion came back and Caddy held it above Mother's head. She drew Mother back in the chair and Mother lay crying against the red and yellow cushion. ""Hush, Mother."" Caddy said. ""You go up stairs and lay down, so you can be sick. I'll go get Dilsey."" She led me to the fire and I looked at the bright, smooth shapes. I could hear the fire and the roof Father took me up. He smelled like rain. ""Well, Benjy."" he said. ""Have you been a good boy today."" Caddy and Jason were fighting in the mirror. ""You, Caddy."" Father said. They fought. Jason began to cry. ""Caddy."" Father said. Jason was crying. He wasn't fighting anymore, but we could see Caddy fighting",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,26,"in the mirror and Father put me down and went into the mirror and fought too. He lifted Caddy up. She fought. Jason lay on the floor, crying. He had the scissors in his hand. Father held Caddy. ""He cut up all Benjy's dolls."" Caddy said. ""I'll slit his gizzle."" ""Candace."" Father said. ""I will."" Caddy said. ""I will."" She fought. Father held her. She kicked at Jason. He rolled into the corner, out of the mirror. Father brought Caddy to the fire. They were all out of the mirror. Only the fire was in it. Like the fire was in a door. ""Stop that."" Father said. ""Do you want to make Mother sick in her room. Caddy stopped. ""He cut up all the dolls Mau Benjy and I made."" Caddy said. ""He did it just for meanness. ""I didn't."" Jason said. He was sitting up, crying. ""I didn't know they were his. I just thought they were some old papers. ""You couldn't help but know."" Caddy said. ""You did it just "" ""Hush."" Father said. ""Jason."" he said. ""I'll make you some more tomorrow."" Caddy said. ""We'll make a lot of them. Here, you can look at the cushion, too."" 19.18 Jason came in. I kept telling you to hush, Luster said. What's the matter now, Jason said. ""He just trying hisself."" Luster said. ""That the way he been going on all day."" ""Why dont you let him alone, then."" Jason said. ""If you cant keep him quiet, you'll have to take him out to the kitchen. The rest of us cant shut ourselves up in a room like Mother does."" ""Mammy say keep him out the kitchen till she get supper."" Luster said. ""Then play with him and keep him quiet."" Jason said. ""Do I have to work all day and then come home to a mad house."" He opened the paper and read it. 2.8 You can look at the fire and the mirror and the cushion too, Caddy said. You wont have to wait until supper to look at the cushion, now. We could hear the roof. We could hear Jason too, crying loud beyond the wall. 19.19 Dilsey said, ""You come, Jason. You letting him alone, is you."" ""Yessum."" Luster said. ""Where Quentin."" Dilsey said. ""Supper near bout ready."" ""I don't know'm."" Luster said. ""I aint seen her."" Dilsey went away. ""Quentin."" she said in the hall. ""Quentin. Supper ready."" 2.9 We could hear the roof. Quentin smelled like rain, too. What did Jason do, he said. He cut up all Benjy's dolls, Caddy said. Mother said to not call him Benjy, Quentin said. He sat on the rug by us. I wish it wouldn't rain, he said. You cant do anything. You've been in a fight, Caddy said. Haven't you. It wasn't much, Quentin said. You can tell it, Caddy said. Father'll see it. I dont care, Quentin said. I wish it wouldn't rain. 19.20 Quentin said, ""Didn't Dilsey say supper was ready."" ""Yessum."" Luster said. Jason looked at Quentin. Then he read the paper again. Quentin came in. ""She say it bout ready."" Luster said. Quentin jumped down in Mother's chair. Luster said, ""Mr Jason."" ""What."" Jason said. ""Let me have two bits."" Luster said. ""What for."" Jason said. ""To go to the show tonight."" Luster said. ""I thought Dilsey was going to get a quarter from Frony for you."" Jason said. ""She did."" Luster said. ""I lost it. Me and Benjy hunted all day for that quarter. You can ask him."" ""Then borrow one from him."" Jason said. ""I have to work for mine."" He read the paper. Quentin looked at the fire. The fire was in her eyes and on her mouth. Her mouth was red. ""I tried to keep him away from there."" Luster said. ""Shut your mouth."" Quentin said. Jason looked at her. ""What did I tell you I was going to do if I saw you with that show fellow again."" he said. Quentin looked at the fire. ""Did you hear me."" Jason said. ""I heard you."" Quentin said. ""Why dont you do it, then."" ""Dont you worry."" Jason said. ""I'm not."" Quentin said. Jason read the paper again. 2.10 I could hear the roof Father leaned forward and looked at Quentin. Hello, he said. Who won. ""Nobody."" Quentin said. ""They stopped us. Teachers."" ""Who was it."" Father said. ""Will you tell."" ""It was all right."" Quentin said. ""He was as big as me."" ""That's good."" Father said. ""Can you tell what it was about."" ""It wasn't anything."" Quentin said. ""He said he would put a frog in her desk and she wouldn't dare to whip him."" ""Oh."" Father said. ""She. And then what."" ""Yes, sir."" Quentin said. ""And then I kind of hit him."" We could hear",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
sound-and-fury,27,"the roof and the fire, and a snuffling outside the door. ""Where was he going to get a frog in November."" Father said. ""I dont know, sir."" Quentin said. We could hear them. ""Jason."" Father said. We could hear Jason. ""Jason."" Father said. ""Come in here and stop that."" We could hear the roof and the fire and Jason. ""Stop that, now. "" Father said. ""Do you want me to whip you again."" Father lifted Jason up into the chair by him. Jason snuffled. We could hear the fire and the roof. Jason snuffled a little louder. ""One more time."" Father said. We could hear the fire and the roof. 2.13 Dilsey said, All right. You all can come on to supper. Versh smelled like rain. He smelled like a dog, too. We could hear the fire and the roof. 9.1 We could hear Caddy walking fast. Father and Mother looked at the door. Caddy passed it, walking fast. She didn't look. She walked fast. ""Candace."" Mother said. Caddy stopped walking. ""Yes, Mother."" she said. ""Hush, Caroline."" Father said. ""Come here."" Mother said. ""Hush, Caroline."" Father said. ""Let her alone."" Caddy came to the door and stood there, looking at Father and Mother. Her eyes flew at me, and away. I began to cry. It went loud and I got up. Caddy came in and stood with her back to the wall, looking at me. I went toward her, crying, and she shrank against the wall and I saw her eyes and I cried louder and pulled at her dress. She put her hands out but I pulled at her dress. Her eyes ran. 2.11 Versh said, Your name Benjamin now. You know how come your name Benjamin now. They making a bluegum out of you. Mammy say in old time your granpaw changed nigger's name, and he turn preacher, and when they look at him, he bluegum too. Didn't use to be bluegum, neither. And when family woman look him in the eye in the full of the moon, chile born bluegum. And one evening, when they was about a dozen them bluegum chillen running around the place, he never come home. Possum hunters found him in the woods, et clean. And you know who et him. Them bluegum chillen did. 9.2 We were in the hall. Caddy was still looking at me. Her hand was against her mouth and I saw her eyes and I cried. We went up the stairs. She stopped again, against the wall, looking at me and I cried and she went on and I came on, crying, and she shrank against the wall, looking at me. She opened the door to her room, but I pulled at her dress and we went to the bathroom and she stood against the door, looking at me. Then she put her arm across her face and I pushed at her, crying. 19.21 What are you doing to him, Jason said. Why cant you let him alone. I aint touching him, Luster said. He been doing this way all day long. He needs whipping. He needs to be sent to Jackson, Quentin said. How can anybody live in a house like this. If you dont like it, young lady, you'd better get out, Jason said. I'm going to, Quentin said. Dont you worry. 2.12 Versh said, ""You move back some, so I can dry my legs off."" He shoved me back a little. ""Dont you start bellering, now. You can still see it. That's all you have to do. You aint had to be out in the rain like I is. You's born lucky and dont know it."" He lay on his back before the fire. ""You know how come your name Benjamin now."" Versh said. ""Your mamma too proud for you. What mammy say."" ""You be still there and let me dry my legs off."" Versh said. ""Or you know what I'll do. I'll skin your rinktum."" We could hear the fire and the roof and Versh. Versh got up quick and jerked his legs back. Father said, ""All right, Versh."" ""I'll feed him tonight."" Caddy said. ""Sometimes he cries when Versh feeds him."" ""Take this tray up."" Dilsey said. ""And hurry back and feed Benjy."" ""Dont you want Caddy to feed you."" Caddy said. 19.22 Has he got to keep that old dirty slipper on the table, Quentin said. Why dont you feed him in the kitchen. It's like eating with a pig. If you dont like the way we eat, you'd better not come to the table, Jason said. 2.14 Steam came off of Roskus. He was sitting in front of the stove. The oven door was open and Roskus had his feet in it. Steam came off the bowl. Caddy put the spoon",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,28,"into my mouth easy. There was a black spot on the inside of the bowl. 19.23 Now, now, Dilsey said. He aint going to bother you no more. 2.15 It got down below the mark. Then the bowl was empty. It went away. ""He's hungry tonight."" Caddy said. The bowl came back. I couldn't see the spot. Then I could. ""He's starved, tonight."" Caddy said. ""Look how much he's eaten."" 19.24 Yes he will, Quentin said. You all send him out to spy on me. I hate this house. I'm going to run away. 2.16 Roskus said, ""It going to rain all night."" 19.25 You've been running a long time, not to've got any further off than mealtime, Jason said. See if I dont, Quentin said. 2.17 ""Then I dont know what I going to do."" Dilsey said. ""It caught me in the hip so bad now I cant scarcely move. Climbing them stairs all evening."" 19.26 Oh, I wouldn't be surprised, Jason said. I wouldn't be surprised at anything you'd do. Quentin threw her napkin on the table. Hush your mouth, Jason, Dilsey said. She went and put her arm around Quentin. Sit down, honey, Dilsey said. He ought to be shamed of hisself throwing what aint your fault up to you. 2.18 ""She sulling again, is she."" Roskus said. ""Hush your mouth."" Dilsey said. 19.27 Quentin pushed Dilsey away. She looked at Jason. Her mouth was red. She picked up her glass of water and swung her arm back, looking at Jason. Dilsey caught her arm. They fought. The glass broke on the table, and the water ran into the table. Quentin was running. 2.19 ""Mother's sick again."" Caddy said. ""Sho she is."" Dilsey said. ""Weather like this make anybody sick. When you going to get done eating, boy."" 19.28 Goddam you, Quentin said. Goddam you. We could hear her running on the stairs. We went to the library. 2.20 Caddy gave me the cushion, and I could look at the cushion and the mirror and the fire. ""We must be quiet while Quentin's studying."" Father said. ""What are you doing, Jason."" ""Nothing."" Jason said. ""Suppose you come over here to do it, then."" Father said. Jason came out of the corner. ""What are you chewing."" Father said. ""Nothing. "" Jason said. ""He's chewing paper again."" Caddy said. ""Come here, Jason."" Father said. Jason threw into the fire. It hissed, uncurled, turning black. Then it was gray. Then it was gone. Caddy and Father and Jason were in Mother's chair. Jason's eyes were puffed shut and his mouth moved, like tasting. Caddy's head was on Father's shoulder. Her hair was like fire, and little points of fire were in her eyes, and I went and Father lifted me into the chair too, and Caddy held me. She smelled like trees. 19.29 She smelled like trees. In the corner it was dark, but I could see the window. I squatted there, holding the slipper. I couldn't see it, but my hands saw it, and I could hear it getting night, and my hands saw the slipper but I couldn't see myself but my hands could see the slipper, and I squatted there, hearing it getting dark. Here you is, Luster said. Look what I got. He showed it to me. You know where I got it. Miss Quentin give it to me. I knowed they couldn't keep me out. What you doing, off in here. I thought you done slipped back out doors. Aint you done enough moaning and slobbering today, without hiding off in this here empty room, mumbling and taking on. Come on here to bed, so I can get up there before it starts. I cant fool with you all night tonight. Just let them horns toot the first toot and I done gone. 1.16 We didn't go to our room. ""This is where we have the measles."" Caddy said. ""Why do we have to sleep in here tonight."" ""What you care where you sleep."" Dilsey said. She shut the door and sat down and began to undress me. Jason began to cry. ""Hush."" Dilsey said. ""I want to sleep with Damuddy."" Jason said. ""She's sick."" Caddy said. ""You can sleep with her when she gets well. Cant he, Dilsey."" ""Hush, now."" Dilsey said. Jason hushed. ""Our nighties are here, and everything."" Caddy said. ""It's like moving."" ""And you better get into them."" Dilsey said. ""You be unbuttoning Jason. Caddy unbuttoned Jason. He began to cry. ""You want to get whipped."" Dilsey said. Jason hushed. 19.30 Quentin, Mother said in the hall. What, Quentin said beyond the wall. We heard Mother lock the door. She looked in our door and came in and stooped over the bed and kissed me on the forehead. When you get",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,29,"him to bed, go and ask Dilsey if she objects to my having a hot water bottle, Mother said. Tell her that if she does, I'll try to get along without it. Tell her I just want to know. Yessum, Luster said. Come on. Get your pants off. 1.17 Quentin and Versh came in. Quentin had his face turned away. ""What are you crying for."" Caddy said. ""Hush."" Dilsey said. ""You all get undressed, now. You can go on home, Versh."" 19.31 I got undressed and I looked at myself and I began to cry. Hush, Luster said. Looking for them aint going to do no good. They're gone. You keep on like this, and we aint going have you no more birthday. He put my gown on. I hushed, and then Luster stopped, his head toward the window. Then he went to the window and looked out. He came back and took my arm. Here she come, he said. Be quiet, now. We went to the window and looked out. It came out of Quentin's window and climbed across into the tree. We watched the tree shaking. The shaking went down the tree, then it came out and we watched it go away across the grass. Then we couldn't see it. Come on, Luster said. There now. Hear them horns. You get in that bed while my foots behaves. 1.18 There were two beds. Quentin got in the other one. He turned his face to the wall. Dilsey put Jason in with him. Caddy took her dress off. ""Just look at your drawers."" Dilsey said. ""You better be glad your maw aint seen you."" ""I already told on her."" Jason said. ""I bound you would."" Dilsey said. ""And see what you got by it."" Caddy said. ""Tattletale."" ""What did I get by it."" Jason said. ""Whyn't you get your nightie on."" Dilsey said. She went and helped Caddy take off her bodice and drawers. ""Just look at you."" Dilsey said. She wadded the drawers and scrubbed Caddy behind with them. ""It done soaked clean through onto you."" she said. ""But you wont get no bath this night. Here."" She put Caddy's nightie on her and Caddy climbed into the bed and Dilsey went to the door and stood with her hand on the light. ""You all be quiet now, you hear."" she said. ""All right."" Caddy said. ""Mother's not coming in tonight."" she said. ""So we still have to mind me."" ""Yes."" Dilsey said. ""Go to sleep, now."" ""Mother's sick."" Caddy said. ""She and Damuddy are both sick."" ""Hush."" Dilsey said. ""You go to sleep."" The room went black, except the door. Then the door went black. Caddy said, ""Hush, Maury"" putting her hand on me. So I stayed hushed. We could hear us. We could hear the dark. It went away, and Father looked at us. He looked at Quentin and Jason, then he came and kissed Caddy and put his hand on my head. ""Is Mother very sick."" Caddy said. ""No."" Father said. ""Are you going to take good care of Maury."" ""Yes."" Caddy said. Father went to the door and looked at us again. Then the dark came back, and he stood black in the door, and then the door turned black again. Caddy held me and I could hear us all, and the darkness, and something I could smell. And then I could see the windows, where the trees were buzzing. Then the dark began to go in smooth, bright shapes, like it always does, even when Caddy says that I have been asleep. June 2, 1910 When the shadow of the sash appeared on the curtains it was between seven and eight oclock and then I was in time again, hearing the watch. It was Grandfather's and when Father gave it to me he said I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire; it's rather excruciating-ly apt that you will use it to gain the reducto absurdum of all human experience which can fit your individual needs no better than it fitted his or his father's. I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all your breath trying to conquer it. Because no battle is ever won he said. They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools. It was propped against the collar box and I lay listening to it. Hearing it, that is. I dont suppose anybody ever deliberately listens to a watch or a clock. You dont have to. You can be oblivious to the sound for a long while, then in a second of",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,30,"ticking it can create in the mind unbroken the long diminishing parade of time you didn't hear. Like Father said down the long and lonely light-rays you might see Jesus walking, like. And the good Saint Francis that said Little Sister Death, that never had a sister. Through the wall I heard Shreve's bed-springs and then his slippers on the floor hishing. I got up and went to the dresser and slid my hand along it and touched the watch and turned it face-down and went back to bed. But the shadow of the sash was still there and I had learned to tell almost to the minute, so I'd have to turn my back to it, feeling the eyes animals used to have in the back of their heads when it was on top, itching. It's always the idle habits you acquire which you will regret. Father said that. That Christ was not crucified: he was worn away by a minute clicking of little wheels. That had no sister. And so as soon as I knew I couldn't see it, I began to wonder what time it was. Father said that constant speculation regarding the position of mechanical hands on an arbitrary dial which is a symptom of mind- function. Excrement Father said like sweating. And I saying All right. Wonder. Go on and wonder. If it had been cloudy I could have looked at the window, thinking what he said about idle habits. Thinking it would be nice for them down at New London if the weather held up like this. Why shouldn't it? The month of brides, the voice that breathed She ran right out of the mirror, out of the banked scent. Roses. Roses. Mr and Mrs Jason Richmond Compson announce the marriage of. Roses. Not virgins like dogwood, milkweed. I said I have committed incest, Father I said. Roses. Cunning and serene. If you attend Harvard one year, but dont see the boat-race, there should be a refund. Let Jason have it. Give Jason a year at Harvard. Shreve stood in the door, putting his collar on, his glasses glinting rosily, as though he had washed them with his face. ""You taking a cut this morning?"" ""Is it that late?"" He looked at his watch. ""Bell in two minutes."" ""I didn't know it was that late."" He was still looking at the watch, his mouth shaping. ""I'll have to hustle. I cant stand another cut. The dean told me last week--"" He put the watch back into his pocket. Then I quit talking. ""You'd better slip on your pants and run,"" he said. He went out. I got up and moved about, listening to him through the wall. He entered the sitting-room, toward the door. ""Aren't you ready yet?"" ""Not yet. Run along. I'll make it."" He went out. The door closed. His feet went down the corridor. Then I could hear the watch again. I quit moving around and went to the window and drew the curtains aside and watched them running for chapel, the same ones fighting the same heaving coat-sleeves, the same books and flapping collars flushing past like debris on a flood, and Spoade. Calling Shreve my husband. Ah let him alone, Shreve said, if he's got better sense than to chase after the little dirty sluts, whose business. In the South you are ashamed of being a virgin. Boys. Men. They lie about it. Because it means less to women, Father said. He said it was men invented virginity not women. Father said it's like death: only a state in which the others are left and I said, But to believe it doesn't matter and he said, That's what's so sad about anything: not only virginity and I said, Why couldn't it have been me and not her who is unvirgin and he said, That's why that's sad too; nothing is even worth the changing of it, and Shreve said if he's got better sense than to chase after the little dirty sluts and I said Did you ever have a sister? Did you? Did you? Spoade was in the middle of them like a terrapin in a street full of scuttering dead leaves, his collar about his ears, moving at his customary unhurried walk. He was from South Carolina, a senior. It was his club's boast that he never ran for chapel and had never got there on time and had never been absent in four years and had never made either chapel or first lecture with a shirt on his back and socks on his feet. About ten oclock he'd come in Thompson's, get two cups of coffee, sit down and take his socks out of his pocket and remove his shoes and put them on while the",no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,31,"coffee cooled. About noon you'd see him with a shirt and collar on, like anybody else. The others passed him running, but he never increased his pace at all. After a while the quad was empty. A sparrow slanted across the sunlight, onto the window ledge, and cocked his head at me. His eye was round and bright. First he'd watch me with one eye, then flick! and it would be the other one, his throat pumping faster than any pulse. The hour began to strike. The sparrow quit swapping eyes and watched me steadily with the same one until the chimes ceased, as if he were listening too. Then he flicked off the ledge and was gone. It was a while before the last stroke ceased vibrating. It stayed in the air, more felt than heard, for a long time. Like all the bells that ever rang still ringing in the long dying light-rays and Jesus and Saint Francis talking about his sister. Because if it were just to hell; if that were all of it. Finished. If things just finished themselves. Nobody else there but her and me. If we could just have done something so dreadful that they would have fled hell except us. I have committed incest I said Father it was I it was not Dalton Ames And when he put Dalton Ames. Dalton Ames. Dalton Ames. When he put the pistol in my hand I didn't. That's why I didn't. He would be there and she would and I would. Dalton Ames. Dalton Ames. Dalton Ames. If we could have just done something so dreadful and Father said That's sad too people cannot do anything that dreadful they cannot do anything very dreadful at all they cannot even remember tomorrow what seemed dreadful today and I said, You can shirk all things and he said, Ah can you. And I will look down and see my murmuring bones and the deep water like wind, like a roof of wind, and after a long time they cannot distinguish even bones upon the lonely and inviolate sand. Until on the Day when He says Rise only the flat-iron would come floating up. It's not when you realise that nothing can help you--religion, pride, anything--it's when you realise that you dont need any aid. Dalton Ames. Dalton Ames. Dalton Ames. If I could have been his mother lying with open body lifted laughing, holding his father with my hand refraining, seeing, watching him die before he lived. One minute she was standing in the door I went to the dresser and took up the watch, with the face still down. I tapped the crystal on the corner of the dresser and caught the fragments of glass in my hand and put them into the ashtray and twisted the hands off and put them in the tray. The watch ticked on. I turned the face up, the blank dial with little wheels clicking and click- ing behind it, not knowing any better. Jesus walking on Galilee and Washington not telling lies. Father brought back a watch-charm from the Saint Louis Fair to Jason: a tiny opera glass into which you squinted with one eye and saw a skyscraper, a ferris wheel all spidery, Niagara Falls on a pinhead. There was a red smear on the dial. When I saw it my thumb began to smart. I put the watch down and went into Shreve's room and got the iodine and painted the cut. I cleaned the rest of the glass out of the rim with a towel. I laid out two suits of underwear, with socks, shirts, collars and ties, and packed my trunk. I put in everything except my new suit and an old one and two pairs of shoes and two hats, and my books. I carried the books into the sitting-room and stacked them on the table, the ones I had brought from home and the ones Father said it used to be a gentleman was known by his books; nowadays he is known by the ones he has not returned and locked the trunk and addressed it. The quarter hour sounded. I stopped and listened to it until the chimes ceased. I bathed and shaved. The water made my finger smart a little, so I painted it again. I put on my new suit and put my watch on and packed the other suit and the accessories and my razor and brushes in my hand bag, and folded the trunk key into a sheet of paper and put it in an envelope and addressed it to Father, and wrote the two notes and sealed them. The shadow hadn't quite cleared the stoop. I stopped inside the door, watching the shadow move. It moved almost",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,32,"perceptibly, creeping back inside the door, driving the shadow back into the door. Only she was running already when I heard it. In the mirror she was running before I knew what it was. That quick her train caught up over her arm she ran out of the mirror like a cloud, her veil swirling in long glints her heels brittle and fast clutch ing her dress onto her shoulder with the other hand, run ning out of the mirror the smells roses roses the voice that breathed o'er Eden. Then she was across the porch I couldn't hear her heels then in the moonlight like a cloud, the floating shadow of the veil running across the grass, into the bellowing. She ran out of her dress, clutching her bridal, running into the bellowing where T. P. in the dew Whooey Sassprilluh Benjy under the box bellowing. Father had a V-shaped silver cuirass on his running chest Shreve said, ""Well, you didn't.... Is it a wedding or a wake?"" ""I couldn't make it,"" I said. ""Not with all that primping. What's the matter? You think this was Sunday?"" ""I reckon the police wont get me for wearing my new suit one time,"" I said. ""I was thinking about the Square students. They'll think you go to Harvard. Have you got too proud to at tend classes too?"" ""I'm going to eat first."" The shadow on the stoop was gone. I stepped into sunlight, finding my shadow again. I walked down the steps just ahead of it. The half hour went. Then the chimes ceased and died away. Deacon wasn't at the postoffice either. I stamped the two envelopes and mailed the one to Father and put Shreve's in my inside pocket, and then I remembered where I had last seen the Deacon. It was on Decoration Day, in a G.A.R. uniform, in the middle of the parade. If you waited long enough on any corner you would see him in whatever parade came along. The one before was on Columbus' or Garibaldi's or somebody's birthday. He was in the Street Sweepers' section, in a stovepipe hat, carrying a two inch Italian flag, smoking a cigar among the brooms and scoops. But the last time was the G.A.R. one, because Shreve said: ""There now. Just look at what your grandpa did to that poor old nigger."" ""Yes,"" I said. ""Now he can spend day after day marching in parades. If it hadn't been for my grandfather, he'd have to work like whitefolks."" I didn't see him anywhere. But I never knew even a working nigger that you could find when you wanted him, let alone one that lived off the fat of the land. A car came along. I went over to town and went to Parker's and had a good breakfast. While I was eating I heard a clock strike the hour. But then I suppose it takes at least one hour to lose time in, who has been longer than history getting into the mechanical progression of it. When I finished breakfast I bought a cigar. The girl said a fifty cent one was the best, so I took one and lit it and went out to the street. I stood there and took a couple of puffs, then I held it in my hand and went on toward the corner. I passed a jeweller's window, but I looked away in time. At the corner two bootblacks caught me, one on either side, shrill and raucous, like blackbirds. I gave the cigar to one of them, and the other one a nickel. Then they let me alone. The one with the cigar was trying to sell it to the other for the nickel. There was a clock, high up in the sun, and I thought about how, when you dont want to do a thing, your body will try to trick you into doing it, sort of unawares. I could feel the muscles in the back of my neck, and then I could hear my watch ticking away in my pocket and after a while I had all the other sounds shut away, leaving only the watch in my pocket. I turned back up the street, to the window. He was working at the table behind the window. He was going bald. There was a glass in his eye--a metal tube screwed into his face. I went in. The place was full of ticking, like crickets in September grass, and I could hear a big clock on the wall above his head. He looked up, his eye big and blurred and rushing beyond the glass. I took mine out and handed it to him. ""I broke my watch."" He flipped it over in his hand. ""I should say you",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,33,"have. You must have stepped on it."" ""Yes, sir. I knocked it off the dresser and stepped on it in the dark. It's still running though."" He pried the back open and squinted into it. ""Seems to be all right. I cant tell until I go over it, though. I'll go into it this afternoon."" ""I'll bring it back later,"" I said. ""Would you mind telling me if any of those watches in the window are right?"" He held my watch on his palm and looked up at me with his blurred rushing eye. ""I made a bet with a fellow,"" I said. ""And I forgot my glasses this morning."" ""Why, all right,"" he said. He laid the watch down and half rose on his stool and looked over the barrier. Then he glanced up at the wall. ""It's twen--"" ""Dont tell me,"" I said, ""please sir. Just tell me if any of them are right."" He looked at me again. He sat back on the stool and pushed the glass up onto his forehead. It left a red circle around his eye and when it was gone his whole face looked naked. ""What're you celebrating today?"" he said. ""That boat race aint until next week, is it?"" ""No, sir. This is just a private celebration. Birthday. Are any of them right?"" ""No. But they haven't been regulated and set yet. If you're thinking of buying one of them-"" ""No, sir. I dont need a watch. We have a clock in our sitting room. I'll have this one fixed when I do."" I reached my hand. ""Better leave it now."" ""I'll bring it back later."" He gave me the watch. I put it in my pocket. I couldn't hear it now, above all the others. ""I'm much obliged to you. I hope I haven't taken up your time."" ""That's all right. Bring it in when you are ready. And you better put off this celebration until after we win that boat race."" ""Yes, sir. I reckon I had."" I went out, shutting the door upon the ticking. I looked back into the window. He was watching me across the barrier. There were about a dozen watches in the window, a dozen different hours and each with the same assertive and contradictory assurance that mine had, without any hands at all. Contradicting one another. I could hear mine, ticking away inside my pocket, even though nobody could see it, even though it could tell nothing if anyone could. And so I told myself to take that one. Because Father said clocks slay time. He said time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels; only when the clock stops does time come to life. The hands were extended, slightly off the horizontal at a faint angle, like a gull tilting into the wind. Holding all I used to be sorry about like the new moon holding water, niggers say. The jeweller was working again, bent over his bench, the tube tunnelled into his face. His hair was parted in the center. The part ran up into the bald spot, like a drained marsh in December. I saw the hardware store from across the street. I didn't know you bought flat-irons by the pound. ""Maybe you want a tailor's goose,"" the clerk said. ""They weigh ten pounds."" Only they were bigger than I thought. So I got two six-pound little ones, because they would look like a pair of shoes wrapped up. They felt heavy enough together, but I thought again how Father had said about the reducto absurdum of human experience, thinking how the only opportunity I seemed to have for the application of Harvard. Maybe by next year; thinking maybe it takes two years in school to learn to do that properly. But they felt heavy enough in the air. A car came. I got on. I didn't see the placard on the front. It was full, mostly prosperous looking people reading newspapers. The only vacant seat was beside a nigger. He wore a derby and shined shoes and he was holding a dead cigar stub. I used to think that a Southerner had to be always conscious of niggers. I thought that Northerners would expect him to. When I first came East I kept thinking You've got to remember to think of them as colored people not niggers, and if it hadn't happened that I wasn't thrown with many of them, I'd have wasted a lot of time and trouble before I learned that the best way to take all people, black or white, is to take them for what they think they are, then leave them alone. That was when I realisedthat a Digger is not a person so much as a form",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,34,"of behavior; a sort of obverse reflection of the white people he lives among. But I thought at first that I ought to miss having a lot of them around me because I thought that Northerners thought I did, but I didn't know that I really had missed Roskus and Dilsey and them until that morning in Virginia. The train was stopped when I waked and I raised the shade and looked out. The car was blocking a road crossing, where two white fences came down a hill and then sprayed outward and downward like part of the skeleton of a horn, and there was a nigger on a mule in the middle of the stiff ruts, waiting for the train to move. How long he had been there I didn't know, but he sat straddle of the mule, his head wrapped in a piece of blanket, as if they had been built there with the fence and the road, or with the hill, carved out of the hill itself, like a sign put there saying You are home again. He didn't have a saddle and his feet dangled almost to the ground. The mule looked like a rabbit. I raised the window. ""Hey, Uncle,"" I said. ""Is this the way?"" ""Suh?"" He looked at me, then he loosened the blanket and lifted it away from his ear. ""Christmas gift!"" I said. ""Sho comin, boss. You done caught me, aint you."" ""I'll let you off this time."" I dragged my pants out of the little hammock and got a quarter out. ""But look out next time. I'll be coming back through here two days after New Year, and look out then."" I threw the quarter out the window. ""Buy yourself some Santy Claus."" ""Yes, suh,"" he said. He got down and picked up the quarter and rubbed it on his leg. ""Thanky, young marster. Thanky."" Then the train began to move. I leaned out the window, into the cold air, looking back. He stood there beside the gaunt rabbit of a mule, the two of them shabby and motionless and unimpatient. The train swung around the curve, the engine puffing with short, heavy blasts, and they passed smoothly from sight that way, with that quality about them of shabby and timeless patience, of static serenity: that blending of childlike and ready incompetence and paradoxical reliability that tends and protects them it loves out of all reason and robs them steadily and evades responsibility and obligations by means too barefaced to be called subterfuge even and is taken in theft or evasion with only that frank and spontaneous admiration for the victor which a gentleman feels for anyone who beats him in a fair contest, and withal a fond and unflagging tolerance for whitefolks' vagaries like that of a grandparent for unpredictable and troublesome children, which I had forgotten. And all that day, while the train wound through rushing gaps and along ledges where movement was only a laboring sound of the exhaust and groaning wheels and the eternal mountains stood fading into the thick sky, I thought of home, of the bleak station and the mud and the niggers and country folks thronging slowly about the square, with toy monkeys and wagons and candy in sacks and roman candles sticking out, and my insides would move like they used to do in school when the bell rang. I wouldn't begin counting until the clock struck three. Then I would begin, counting to sixty and folding down one finger and thinking of the other fourteen fingers waiting to be folded down, or thirteen or twelve or eight or seven, until all of a sudden I'd realise silence and the unwinking minds, and I'd say ""Ma'am?"" ""Your name is Quentin, isn't it?"" Miss Laura would say. Then more silence and the cruel unwinking minds and hands jerking into the silence. ""Tell Quentin who discovered the Mississippi River, Henry."" ""DeSoto."" Then the minds would go away, and after a while I'd be afraid I had gotten behind and I'd count fast and fold down another finger, then I'd be afraid I was going too fast and I'd slow up, then I'd get afraid and count fast again. So I never could come out even with the bell, and the released surging of feet moving already, feeling earth in the scuffed floor, and the day like a pane of glass struck a light, sharp blow, and my insides would move, sitting still. Moving sitting still. My bowels moved for thee. One minute she was standing in the door. Benjy. Bellowing. Benjamin the child of mine old age bellowing. Caddy! Caddy! I'm going to run away. He began to cry she went and touched him. Hush. I'm not going to. Hush. He hushed. Dilsey. He",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,35,"smell what you tell him when he want to. Dont have to listen nor talk. Can he smell that new name they give him? Can he smell bad luck? What he want to worry about luck for? Luck cant do him no hurt. What they change his name for then if aint trying to help his luck? The car stopped, started, stopped again. Below the window I watched the crowns of people's heads passing beneath new straw hats not yet unbleached. There were women in the car now, with market baskets, and men in work-clothes were beginning to outnumber the shined shoes and collars. The nigger touched my knee. ""Pardon me,"" he said. I swung my legs out and let him pass. We were going beside a blank wall, the sound clattering back into the car, at the women with market baskets on their knees and a man in a stained hat with a pipe stuck in the band. I could smell water, and in a break in the wall I saw a glint of water and two masts, and a gull motionless in midair, like on an invisible wire between the masts, and I raised my hand and through my coat touched the letters I had written. When the car stopped I got off. The bridge was open to let a schooner through. She was in tow, the tug nudging along under her quarter, trailing smoke, but the ship herself was like she was moving without visible means. A man naked to the waist was coiling down a line on the fo'c's'le head. His body was burned the color of leaf tobacco. Another man in a straw hat withoutany crown was at the wheel. The ship went through the bridge, moving under bare poles like a ghost in broad day, with three gulls hovering above the stern like toys on invisible wires. When it closed I crossed to the other side and leaned on the rail above the boathouses. The float was empty and the doors were closed. Crew just pulled in the late afternoon now, resting up before. The shadow of the bridge, the tiers of railing, my shadow leaning flat upon the water, so easily had I tricked it that would not quit me. At least fifty feet it was, and if I only had something to blot it into the water, holding it until it was drowned, the shadow of the package like two shoes wrapped up lying on the water. Niggers say a drowned man's shadow was watching for him in the water all the time. It twinkled and glinted, like breathing, the float slow like breathing too, and debris half submerged, healing out to the sea and the caverns and the grottoes of the sea. The displacement of water is equal to the something of something. Reducto absurdum of all human experience, and two six-pound flat-irons weigh more than one tailor's goose. What a sinful waste Dilsey would say. Benjy knew it when Damuddy died. He cried. He smell hit. He smell hit. The tug came back downstream, the water shearing in long rolling cylinders, rocking the float at last with the echo of passage, the float lurching onto the rolling cylinder with a plopping sound and a long jarring noise as the door rolled back and two men emerged, carrying a shell. They set it in the water and a moment later Bland came out, with the sculls. He wore flannels, a gray jacket and a stiff straw hat. Either he or his mother had read somewhere that Oxford students pulled in flannels and stiff hats, so early one March they bought Gerald a one pair shell and in his flannels and stiff hat he went on the river. The folks at the boathouse threatened to call a policeman, but he went anyway. His mother came down in a hired auto, in a fur suit like an arctic explorer's, and saw him off in a twenty-five mile wind and a steady drove of ice floes like dirty sheep. Ever since then I have believed that God is not only a gentleman and a sport; he is a Kentuckian too. When he sailed away she made a detour and came down to the river again and drove along parallel with him, the car in low gear. They said you couldn't have told they'd ever seen one another before, like a King and Queen, not even looking at one another, just moving side by side across Massachusetts on parallel courses like a couple of planets. He got in and pulled away. He pulled pretty well now. He ought to. They said his mother tried to make him give rowing up and do something else the rest of his class couldn't or wouldn't do, but for",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,36,"once he was stubborn. If you could call it stubbornness, sitting in his attitudes of princely boredom, with his curly yellow hair and his violet eyes and his eyelashes and his New York clothes, while his mamma was telling us about Gerald's horses and Gerald's niggers and Gerald's women. Husbands and fathers in Kentucky must have been awful glad when she carried Gerald off to Cambridge. She had an apartment over in town, and Gerald had one there too, besides his rooms in college. She approved of Gerald associating with me because I at least revealed a blundering sense of noblesse oblige by getting myself born below Mason and Dixon, and a few others whose Geography met the requirements (minimum). Forgave, at least. Or condoned. But since she met Spoade coming out of chapel one He said she couldn't be a lady no lady would be out at that hour of the night she never had been able to forgive him for having five names, including that of a present English ducal house. I'm sure she solaced herself by being convinced that some misfit Maingault or Mortemar had got mixed up with the lodge-keeper's daughter. Which was quite probable, whether she invented it or not. Spoade was the world's champion sitter-around, no holds barred and gouging discretionary. The shell was a speck now, the oars catching the sun in spaced glints, as if the hull were winking itself along him along. Did you ever have a sister, No but they're all bitches. Did you ever have a sister? One minute she was. Bitches. Not bitch one minute she stood in the door Dalton Ames. Dalton Ames. Dalton Shirts. I thought all the time they were khaki, army issue khaki, until I saw they were of heavy Chinese silk or finest flannel because they made his face so brown his eyes so blue. Dalton Ames. It just missed gentility. Theatrical fixture. Just papier-mache, then touch. Oh. Asbestos. Not quite bronze. But wont see him at the house. Caddy's a woman too remember. She must do things for women's reasons too. Why wont you bring him to the house, Caddy? Why must you do like nigger women do in the pasture the ditches the dark woods hot hidden furious in the dark woods. And after a while I had been hearing my watch for some time and I could feel the letters crackle through my coat, against the railing, and I leaned on the railing, watching my shadow, how I had tricked it. I moved along the rail, but my suit was dark too and I could wipe my hands, watching my shadow, how I had tricked it. I walked it into the shadow of the quad. Then I went east. Harvard my Harvard boy Harvard harvard That pimple-faced infant she met at the field-meet with colored ribbons. Skulking along the fence trying to whistle her out like a puppy. Because they couldn't cajole him into the diningroom Mother believed he had some sort of spell he was going to cast on her when he got her alone. Yet any blackguard He was lying beside the box under the window bellowing that could drive up in a limousine with a flower in his buttonhole. Harvard. Quentin this is Herbert. My Harvard boy.

Why shouldn't you I want my boys to be more than friends yes Candace and Quentin more than friends Father I have committed what a pity you had no brother or sister No sister no sister had no sister Dont ask Quentin he and Mr Compson both feel a little insulted when I am strong enough to come down to the table I am going on nerve now I'll pay for it after it's all over and you have taken my little daughter away from me My little sister had no.

The Deacon wasn't in sight anywhere. think I would have could have She didn't mean that that's the way women do things it's because she loves Caddy The street lamps would go down the hill then rise toward town I walked upon the belly of my shadow. I could extend my hand beyond it. feeling Father behind me beyond the rasping darkness of summer and August the street lamps Father and I protect women from one another from themselves our women Women are like that they dont acquire knowledge of people we are for that they are just born with a practical fertility of suspicion that makes a crop every so often and usually right they have an affinity for evil for supplying whatever the evil lacks in itself for drawing it about them instinctively as you do bed-clothing in slumber fertilising the mind for it until the evil has served its purpose whether it ever existed or no He was coming along between a couple of freshmen. He hadn't quite recovered from the parade, for he gave me a salute, a very superior-officerish kind. ""I want to see you a minute,"" I said, stopping. ""See me? All right. See you again, fellows,"" he said, stopping and turning back; ""glad to have chatted with you."" That was the Deacon, all over. Talk about your natural psychologists. They said he hadn't missed a train at the beginning of school in forty years, and that he could pick out a Southerner with one glance. He never missed, and once he had heard you speak, he could name your state. He had a regular uniform he met trains in, a sort of Uncle Tom's cabin outfit, patches and all. ""Yes, suh. Right dis way, young marster, hyer we is,"" taking your bags. ""Hyer, boy, come hyer and git dese grips."" Whereupon a moving mountain of luggage would edge up, revealing a white boy of about fifteen, and the Deacon would hang another bag on him somehow and drive him off. ""Now, den, dont you crap hit. Yes, suh, young marster, jes give de old nigger yo room number, and hit'll be done got cold afar when you arrives."" From then on until he had you completely subjugated he was always in or out of your room, ubiquitous and garrulous, though his manner gradually moved northward as his raiment improved, until at last when he had bled you until you began to learn better he was calling you Quentin or whatever, and when you saw him next he'd be wearing a cast-off Brooks suit and a hat with a Princeton club I forget which band that someone had given him and which he was pleasantly and unshakably convinced was a part of Abe Lincoln's military sash. Someone spread the story years ago, when he first appeared around college from wherever he came from, that he was a graduate of the divinity school. And when he came to understand what it meant he was so taken with it that he began to retail the story himself, until at last he must have come to believe he really had. Anyway he related long pointless anecdotes of his undergraduate days, speaking familiarly of dead and departed professors by their first names, usually incorrect ones. But he had been guide mentor and friend to unnumbered crops of innocent and lonely freshmen, and I suppose that with all his petty chicanery and hypocrisy he stank no higher in heaven's nostrils than any other. ""Haven't seen you in three-four days,"" he said, staring at me from his still military aura. ""You been sick?"" ""No. I've been all right. Working, I reckon. I've seen you, though."" ""Yes?"" ""In the parade the other day."" ""Oh, that. Yes, I was there. I dont care nothing about that sort of thing, you understand, but the boys likes to have me with them, the vet'runs does. Ladies wants all the old vet'runs to turn out, you know. So I has to oblige them."" ""And on that Wop holiday too,"" I said. ""You were obliging the W. C. T. U. then, I reckon."" ""That? I was doing that for my son-in-law. He aims to get a job on the city forces. Street cleaner. I tells him all he wants is a broom to sleep on. You saw me, did you?"" ""Both times. Yes."" ""I mean, in uniform. How'd I look?"" ""You looked fine. You looked better than any of them. They ought to make you a general, Deacon."" He touched my arm, lightly, his hand that worn, gentle quality of niggers' hands. ""Listen. This aint for outside talking.

Then see where I'm marching. I wont need to tell you how I'm fixing it; I say, just wait and see, my boy."" He looked at me now and clapped me lightly on the shoulder and rocked back on his heels, nodding at me. ""Yes, sir. I didn't turn Democrat three years ago for nothing. My son-in-law on the city; me-- Yes, sir. If just turning Democrat'll make that son of a bitch go to work.... And me: just you stand on that corner yonder a year from two days ago, and see."" ""I hope so. You deserve it, Deacon. And while I think about it--"" I took the letter from my pocket. ""Take this around to my room tomorrow and give it to Shreve. He'll have something for you. But not till tomorrow,mind."" He took the letter and examined it. ""It's sealed up."" ""Yes. And it's written inside, Not good until tomorrow."" ""H'm,"" he said. He looked at the envelope, his mouth pursed. ""Something for me, you say?"" ""Yes. A present I'm making you."" He was looking at me now, the envelope white in his black hand, in the sun. His eyes were soft and irisless and brown, and suddenly I saw Roskus watching me from behind all his whitefolks' claptrap of uniforms and politics and Harvard manner, diffident, secret, inarticulate and sad. ""You aint playing a joke on the old nigger, is you?"" ""You know I'm not. Did any Southerner ever play a joke on you?"" ""You're right. They're fine folks. But you cant live with them."" ""Did you ever try?"" I said. But Roskus was gone. Once more he was that self he had long since taught himself to ""I'll confer to your wishes, my boy."" ""Not until tomorrow, remember."" ""Sure,"" he said; ""understood, my boy. Well--"" ""I hope--"" I said. He looked down at me, benignant, profound. Suddenly I held out my hand and we shook, he gravely, from the pompous height of his municipal and military dream. ""You're a good fellow, Deacon. I hope.... You've helped a lot of young fellows, here and there."" ""I've tried to treat all folks right,"" he said. ""I draw no petty social lines. A man to me is a man, wherever I find him."" ""I hope you'll always find as many friends as you've made."" ""Young fellows. I get along with them. They dont forget me, neither,"" he said, waving the envelope. He put it into his pocket and buttoned his coat. ""Yes, sir,"" he said. ""I've had good friends."" The chimes began again, the half hour. I stood in the belly of my shadow and listened to the strokes spaced and tranquil along the sunlight, among the thin, still little leaves. Spaced and peaceful and serene, with that quality of autumn always in bells even in the month of brides. Lying on the ground under the window bellowing He took one look at her and knew. Out of the mouths of babes. The street lamps The chimes ceased. I went back to the postoffice, treading my shadow into pavement. go down the hill then they rise toward town like lanterns hung one above another on a wall. Father said because she loves Caddy she loves people through their shortcomings. Uncle Maury straddling his legs before the fire must remove one hand long enough to drink Christmas. Jason ran on, his hands in his pockets fell down and lay there like a trussed fowl until Versh set him up. Whyn't you keep them hands outen your pockets when you running you could stand up then Rolling his head in the cradle rolling it flat across the back. Caddy told Jason and Versh that the reason Uncle Maury didn't work was that he used to roll his head in the cradle when he was little. Shreve was coming up the walk, shambling, fatly earnest, his glasses glinting beneath the running leaves like little pools. ""I gave Deacon a note for some things. I may not be in this afternoon, so dont you let him have anything until tomorrow, will you?"" ""All right."" He looked at me. ""Say, what're you doing today, anyhow? All dressed up and mooning around like the prologue to a suttee. Did you go to Psychology this morning?"" ""I'm not doing anything. Not until tomorrow, now."" ""What's that you got there?"" ""Nothing. Pair of shoes I had half-soled. Not until tomorrow, you hear?"" ""Sure. All right. Oh, by the way, did you get a letter off the table this morning?"" ""No."" ""It's there. From Semiramis.

One car had just left, and people were already waiting for the next one. I asked, but he didn't know whether another one would leave before noon or not because you'd think that interurbans. So the first one was another trolley. I got on. You can feel noon. I wonder if even miners in the bowels of the earth. That's why whistles: because people that sweat, and if just far enough from sweat you wont hear whistles and in eight minutes you should be that far from sweat in Boston.

People were getting out. The trolley didn't stop so often now, emptied by eating. Then it was past. I got off and stood in my shadow and after a while a car came along and I got on and went back to the interurban station. There was a car ready to leave, and I found a seat next the window and it started and I watched it sort of frazzle out into slack tide flats, and then trees. Now and then I saw the river and I thought how nice it would be for them down at New London if the weather and Gerald's shell going solemnly up the glinting forenoon and I wondered what the old woman would be wanting now, sending me a note before ten oclock in the morning.

Women do have always his voice above the gabble voice that breathed an affinity for evil, for believing that no woman is to be trusted, but that some men are too innocent to protect themselves.

Then he told me how she had gone to the proctor to have him moved out and how the proctor had revealed enough low stubbornness to insist on consulting Shreve first. Then she suggested that he send for Shreve right off and do it, and he wouldn't do that, so after that she was hardly civil to Shreve.

There was a wooden marquee with an old man eating something out of a paper bag, and then the car was out of hearing too. The road went into trees, where it would be shady, but June foliage in New England not much thicker than April at home. I could see a smoke stack.

The road went beside a wall. Trees leaned over the wall, sprayed with sunlight. The stone was cool. Walking near it you could feel the coolness. Only our country was not like this country. There was something about just walking through it. A kind of still and violent fecundity that satisfied even bread-hunger like. Flowing around you, not brooding and nursing every niggard stone.

sound-and-fury,45,"the darkness anyway. And some people's. Niggers. Louis Hatcher never even used his horn carrying it and that old lantern. I said, ""Louis, when was the last time you cleaned that lantern?"" ""I cleant hit a little while back. You member when all dat flood-watter wash dem folks away up yonder? I cleans hit dat ve'y day. Old woman and me settin fo de fire dat night and she say 'Louis, whut you gwine do ef dat flood git out dis fur?' and I say 'Dat's a fack. I reckon I had better clean dat lantun up.' So I cleant hit dat night."" ""That flood was way up in Pennsylvania,"" I said. ""It couldn't ever have got down this far."" ""Dat's whut you says,"" Louis said. ""Watter kin git des ez high en wet in Jefferson ez hit kin in Pennsylvaney, I reckon. Hit's de folks dat says de high watter cant git dis fur dat comes floatin out on de ridge-pole, too."" ""Did you and Martha get out that night?"" ""We done jest cat. I cleans dat lantun and me and her sot de balance of de night on top o dat knoll back de graveyard. En ef I'd a knowed of aihy one higher, we'd a been on hit instead."" ""And you haven't cleaned that lantern since then."" ""Whut I want to clean hit when dey aint no need?"" ""You mean, until another flood comes along?"" ""Hit kep us outen dat un."" ""Oh, come on, Uncle Louis,"" I said. ""Yes, suh. You do yo way en I do mine. Ef all I got to do to keep outen de high watter is to clean dis yere lantun, I wont quoil wid no man."" ""Unc' Louis wouldn't ketch nothin wid a light he could see by,"" Versh said. ""I wuz huntin possums in dis country when dey was still drowndin nits in yo pappy's head wid coal oil, boy,"" Louis said. ""Ketchin um, too."" ""Dat's de troof,"" Versh said. ""I reckon Unc' Louis done caught mo possums than aihy man in dis country."" ""Yes, suh,"" Louis said. ""I got plenty light fer possums to see, all right. I aint heard none o dem complainin. Hush, now. Dar he. Whooey. Hum awn, dawg."" And we'd sit in the dry leaves that whispered a little with the slow respiration of our waiting and with the slow breathing of the earth and the windless October, the rank smell of the lantern fouling the brittle air, listening to the dogs and to the echo of Louis' voice dying away. He never raised it, yet on a still night we have heard it from our front porch. When he called the dogs in he sounded just like the horn he carried slung on his shoulder and never used, but clearer, mellower, as though his voice were a part of darkness and silence, coiling out of it, coiling into it again. WhoOoooo. WhoOoooo. WhoOooooooooooooooo. Got to marry somebody Have there been very many Caddy I dont know too many will you look after Benjy and Father You dont know whose it is then does he know Dont touch me will you look after Benjy and Father I began to feel the water before I came to the bridge. The bridge was of gray stone, lichened, dappled with slow moisture where the fungus crept. Beneath it the water was clear and still in the shadow, whispering and clucking about the stone in fading swirls of spinning sky. Caddy that I've got to marry somebody Versh told me about a man who mutilated himself. He went into the woods and did it with a razor, sitting in a ditch. A broken razor flinging them backward over his shoulder the same motion complete the jerked skein of blood backward not looping. But that's not it. It's not not having them. It's never to have had them then I could say O That That's Chinese I dont know Chinese. And Father said it's because you are a virgin: dont you see? Women are never virgins. Purity is a negative state and therefore contrary to nature. It's nature is hurting you not Caddy and I said That's just words and he said So is virginity and I said you dont know. You cant know and he said Yes. On the instant when we come to realise that tragedy is second-hand. Where the shadow of the bridge fell I could see down for a long way, but not as far as the bottom. When you leave a leaf in water a long time after a while the tissue will be gone and the delicate fibers waving slow as the motion of sleep. They dont touch one another, no matter how knotted up they once were, no matter how close they lay",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,46,"once to the bones. And maybe when He says Rise the eyes will come floating up too, out of the deep quiet and the sleep, to look on glory. And after a while the flat irons would come floating up. I hid them under the end of the bridge and went back and leaned on the rail. I could not see the bottom, but I could see a long way into the motion of the water before the eye gave out, and then I saw a shadow hanging like a fat arrow stemming into the current. Mayflies skimmed in and out of the shadow of the bridge just above the surface. If it could just be a hell beyond that: the clean flame the two of us more than dead. Then you will have only me then only me then the two of us amid the pointing and the horror beyond the clean flame The arrow increased without motion, then in a quick swirl the trout lipped a fly beneath the surface with that sort of gigantic delicacy of an elephant picking up a peanut. The fading vortex drifted away down stream and then I saw the arrow again, nose into the current, wavering delicately to the motion of the water above which the May flies slanted and poised. Only you and me then amid the pointing and the horror walled by the clean flame The trout hung, delicate and motionless among the wavering shadows. Three boys with fishing poles came onto the bridge and we leaned on the rail and looked down at the trout. They knew the fish. He was a neighborhood character. ""They've been trying to catch that trout for twenty-five years. There's a store in Boston offers a twenty-five dollar fishing rod to anybody that can catch him."" ""Why dont you all catch him, then? Wouldn't you like to have a twenty- five dollar fishing rod?"" ""Yes,"" they said. They leaned on the rail, looking down at the trout. ""I sure would,"" one said. ""I wouldn't take the rod,"" the second said. ""I'd take the money instead."" ""Maybe they wouldn't do that,"" the first said. ""I bet he'd make you take the rod."" ""Then I'd sell it."" ""You couldn't get twenty-five dollars for it."" ""I'd take what I could get, then. I can catch just as many fish with this pole as I could with a twenty-five dollar one."" Then they talked about what they would do with twenty-five dollars. They all talked at once, their voices insistent and contradictory and impatient, making of unreality a possibility, then a probability, then an incontrovertible fact, as people will when their desires become words. ""I'd buy a horse and wagon,"" the second said. ""Yes you would,"" the others said. ""I would. I know where I can buy one for twenty-five dollars. I know the man."" ""Who is it?"" ""That's all right who it is. I can buy it for twenty-five dollars."" ""Yah,"" the others said. ""He dont know any such thing. He's just talking."" ""Do you think so?"" the boy said. They continued to jeer at him, but he said nothing more. He leaned on the rail, looking down at the trout which he had already spent, and suddenly the acrimony, the conflict, was gone from their voices, as if to them too it was as though he had captured the fish and bought his horse and wagon, they too partaking of that adult trait of being convinced of anything by an assumption of silent superiority. I suppose that people, using themselves and each other so much by words, are at least consistent in attributing wisdom to a still tongue, and for a while I could feel the other two seeking swiftly for some means by which to cope with him, to rob him of his horse and wagon. ""You couldn't get twenty-five dollars for that pole,"" the first said. ""I bet anything you couldn't."" ""He hasn't caught that trout yet,"" the third said suddenly, then they both cried: ""Yah, what'd I tell you? What's the man's name? I dare you to tell. There aint any such man."" ""Ah, shut up,"" the second said. ""Look. Here he comes again."" They leaned on the rail, motionless, identical, their poles slanting slenderly in the sunlight, also identical. The trout rose without haste, a shadow in faint wavering increase; again the little vortex faded slowly downstream. ""Gee,"" the first one murmured. ""We dont try to catch him anymore,"" he said. ""We just watch Boston folks that come out and try."" ""Is he the only fish in this pool?"" ""Yes. He ran all the others out. The best place to fish around here is down at the Eddy."" ""No it aint,"" the second said. ""It's better at Bigelow's Mill two to one.""",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,47,"Then they argued for a while about which was the best fishing and then left off all of a sudden to watch the trout rise again and the broken swirl of water suck down a little of the sky. I asked how far it was to the nearest town. They told me. ""But the closest car line is that way,"" the second said, pointing back down the road. ""Where are you going?"" ""Nowhere. Just walking."" ""You from the college?"" ""Yes. Are there any factories in that town?"" ""Factories?"" They looked at me. ""No,"" the second said. ""Not there."" They looked at my clothes. ""You looking for work?"" ""How about Bigelow's Mill?"" the third said. ""That's a factory."" ""Factory my eye. He means a sure enough factory."" ""One with a whistle,"" I said. ""I haven't heard any one oclock whistles yet."" ""Oh,"" the second said. ""There's a clock in the unitarial steeple. You can find out the time from that. Haven't you got a watch on that chain?"" ""I broke it this morning."" I showed them my watch. They examined it gravely. ""It's still running,"" the second said. ""What does a watch like that cost?"" ""It was a present,"" I said. ""My father gave it to me when I graduated from high school."" ""Are you a Canadian?"" the third said. He had red hair. ""Canadian?"" ""He dont talk like them,"" the second said. ""I've heard them talk. He talks like they do in minstrel shows."" ""Say,"" the third said. ""Aint you afraid he'll hit you?"" ""Hit me?"" ""You said he talks like a colored man."" ""Ah, dry up,"" the second said. ""You can see the steeple when you get over that hill there."" I thanked them. ""I hope you have good luck. Only dont catch that old fellow down there. He deserves to be let alone."" ""Cant anybody catch that fish,"" the first said. They leaned on the rail, looking down into the water, the three poles like three slanting threads of yellow fire in the sun. I walked upon my shadow, tramping it into the dappled shade of trees again. The road curved, mounting away from the water. It crossed the hill, then descended winding, carrying the eye, the mind on ahead beneath a still green tunnel, and the square cupola above the trees and the round eye of the clock but far enough. I sat down at the roadside. The grass was ankle deep, myriad. The shadows on the road were as still as if they had been put there with a stencil, with slanting pencils of sunlight. But it was only a train, and after a while it died away beyond the trees, the long sound, and then I could hear my watch and the train dying away, as though it were running through another month or another summer somewhere, rushing away under the poised gull and all things rushing. Except Gerald. He would be sort of grand too, pulling in lonely state across the noon, rowing himself right out of noon, up the long bright air like an apotheosis, mounting into a drowsing infinity where only he and the gull, the one terrifically motionless, the other in a steady and measured pull and recover that partook of inertia itself, the world punily beneath their shadows on the sun. Caddy that blackguard that blackguard Caddy Their voices came over the hill, and the three slender poles like balanced threads of running fire. They looked at me passing, not slowing. ""Well,"" I said. ""I dont see him."" ""We didn't try to catch him,"" the first said. ""You cant catch that fish."" ""There's the clock,"" the second said, pointing. ""You can tell the time when you get a little closer."" ""Yes,"" I said. ""All right."" I got up. ""You all going to town?"" ""We're going to the Eddy for chub,"" the first said. ""You cant catch anything at the Eddy,"" the second said. ""I guess you want to go to the mill, with a lot of fellows splashing and scaring all the fish away."" ""You cant catch any fish at the Eddy."" ""We wont catch none nowhere if we dont go on,"" the third said. ""I dont see why you keep on talking about the Eddy,"" the second said. ""You cant catch anything there."" ""You dont have to go,"" the first said. ""You're not tied to me."" ""Let's go to the mill and go swimming,"" the third said. ""I'm going to the Eddy and fish,"" the first said. ""You can do as you please."" ""Say, how long has it been since you heard of anybody catching a fish at the Eddy?"" the second said to the third. ""Let's go to the mill and go swimming,"" the third said. The cupola sank slowly beyond the trees, with the round face of",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,48,"the clock far enough yet. We went on in the dappled shade. We came to an orchard, pink and white. It was full of bees; already we could hear them. ""Let's go to the mill and go swimming,"" the third said. A lane turned off beside the orchard. The third boy slowed and halted. The first went on, flecks of sunlight slipping along the pole across his shoulder and down the back of his shirt. ""Come on,"" the third said. The second boy stopped too. Why must you marry somebody Caddy Do you want me to say it do you think that if I say it it wont be ""Let's go up to the mill,"" he said. ""Come on."" The first boy went on. His bare feet made no sound, falling softer than leaves in the thin dust. In the orchard the bees sounded like a wind getting up, a sound caught by a spell just under crescendo and sustained. The lane went along the wall, arched over, shattered with bloom, dissolving into trees. Sunlight slanted into it, sparse and eager. Yellow butterflies flickered along the shade like flecks of sun. ""What do you want to go to the Eddy for?"" the second boy said. ""You can fish at the mill if you want to."" ""Ah, let him go,"" the third said. They looked after the first boy. Sunlight slid patchily across his walking shoulders, glinting along the pole like yellow ants. ""Kenny,"" the second said. Say it to Father will you I will am my fathers Progenitive I invented him created I him Say it to him it will not be for he will say I was not and then you and I since philoprogenitive ""Ah, come on,"" the third boy said. ""They're already in."" They looked after the first boy. ""Yah,"" they said suddenly, ""go on then, mamma's boy. If he goes swimming he'll get his head wet and then he'll get a licking."" They turned into the lane and went on, the yellow butterflies slanting about them along the shade. it is because there is nothing else I believe there is something else but there may not be and then I You will find that even injustice is scarcely worthy of what you believe yourself to be He paid me no attention, his jaw set in profile, his face turned a little away beneath his broken hat. ""Why dont you go swimming with them?"" I said. that blackguard Caddy Were you trying to pick a fight with him were you A liar and a scoundrel Caddy was dropped from his club for cheating at cards got sent to Coventry caught cheating at midterm exams and expelled Well what about it I'm not going to play cards with ""Do you like fishing better than swimming?"" I said. The sound of the bees diminished, sustained yet, as though instead of sinking into silence, silence merely increased between us, as water rises. The road curved again and became a street between shady lawns with white houses. Caddy that blackguard can you think of Benjy and Father and do it not of me What else can I think about what else have I thought about The boy turned from the street. He climbed a picket fence without looking back and crossed the lawn to a tree and laid the pole down and climbed into the fork of the tree and sat there, his back to the road and the dappled sun motionless at last upon his white shirt. else have I thought about I cant even cry I died last year I told you I had but I didn't know then what I meant I didn't know what I was saying Some days in late August at home are like this, the air thin and eager like this, with something in it sad and nostalgic and familiar. Man the sum of his climatic experiences Father said. Man the sum of what have you. A problem in impure properties carried tediously to an unvarying nil: stalemate of dust and desire. but now I know I'm dead I tell you Then why must you listen we can go away you and Benjy and me where nobody knows us where The buggy was drawn by a white horse, his feet cropping in the thin dust; spidery wheels chattering thin and dry, moving uphill beneath a rippling shawl of leaves. Elm. No: ellum. Ellum. On what on your school money the money they sold the pasture for so you could go to Harvard dont you see you've got to finish now if you dont finish he'll have nothing Sold the pasture His white shirt was motionless in the fork, in the flickering shade. The wheels were spidery. Beneath the sag of the buggy the hooves",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,49,"neatly rapid like the motions of a lady doing embroidery, diminishing without progress like a figure on a treadmill being drawn rapidly offstage. The street turned again. I could see the white cupola, the round stupid assertion of the clock. Sold the pasture Father will be dead in a year they say if he doesn't stop drinking and he wont stop he cant stop since I since last summer and then they'll send Benjy to Jackson I cant cry I cant even cry one minute she was standing in the door the next minute he was pulling at her dress and bellowing his voice hammered back and forth between the walls in waves and she shrinking against the wall getting smaller and smaller with her white face her eyes like thumbs dug into it until he pushed her out of the room his voice hammering back and forth as though its own momentum would not let it stop as though there were no place for it in silence bellowing When you opened the door a bell tinkled, but just once, high and clear and small in the neat obscurity above the door, as though it were gauged and tempered to make that single clear small sound so as not to wear the bell out nor to require the expenditure of too much silence in restoring it when the door opened upon the recent warm scent of baking; a little dirty child with eyes like a toy bear's and two patent-leather pigtails. ""Hello, sister."" Her face was like a cup of milk dashed with coffee in the sweet warm emptiness. ""Anybody here?"" But she merely watched me until a door opened and the lady came. Above the counter where the ranks of crisp shapes behind the glass her neat gray face her hair tight and sparse from her neat gray skull, spectacles in neat gray rims riding approaching like something on a wire, like a cash box in a store. She looked like a librarian. Something among dusty shelves of ordered certitudes long divorced from reality, desiccating peacefully, as if a breath of that air which sees injustice done ""Two of these, please, ma'am."" From under the counter she produced a square cut from a newspaper and laid it on the counter and lifted the two buns out. The little girl watched them with still and unwinking eyes like two currants floating motionless in a cup of weak coffee Land of the kike home of the wop. Watching the bread, the neat gray hands, a broad gold band on the left forefinger, knuckled there by a blue knuckle. ""Do you do your own baking, ma'am?"" ""Sir?"" she said. Like that. Sir? Like on the stage. Sir? ""Five cents. Was there anything else?"" ""No, ma'am. Not for me. This lady wants something."" She was not tall enough to see over the case, so she went to the end of the counter and looked at the little girl. ""Did you bring her in here?"" ""No, ma'am. She was here when I came."" ""You little wretch,"" she said. She came out around the counter, but she didn't touch the little girl. ""Have you got anything in your pockets?"" ""She hasn't got any pockets,"" I said. ""She wasn't doing anything. She was just standing here, waiting for you."" ""Why didn't the bell ring, then?"" She glared at me. She just needed a bunch of switches, a blackboard behind her 2 x 2 e 5. ""She'll hide it under her dress and a body'd never know it. You, child. How'd you get in here?"" The little girl said nothing. She looked at the woman, then she gave me a flying black glance and looked at the woman again. ""Them foreigners,"" the woman said. ""How'd she get in without the bell ringing?"" ""She came in when I opened the door,"" I said. ""It rang once for both of us. She couldn't reach anything from here, anyway. Besides, I dont think she would. Would you, sister?"" The little girl looked at me, secretive, contemplative. ""What do you want? bread?"" She extended her fist. It uncurled upon a nickel, moist and dirty, moist dirt ridged into her flesh. The coin was damp and warm. I could smell it, faintly metallic. ""Have you got a five cent loaf, please, ma'am?"" From beneath the counter she produced a square cut from a newspaper sheet and laid it on the counter and wrapped a loaf into it. I laid the coin and another one on the counter. ""And another one of those buns, please, ma'am."" She took another bun from the case. ""Give me that parcel,"" she said. I gave it to her and she unwrapped it and put the third bun in and wrapped it and took up the coins and",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,50,"found two coppers in her apron and gave them to me. I handed them to the little girl. Her fingers closed about them, damp and hot, like worms. ""You going to give her that bun?"" the woman said. ""Yessum,"" I said. ""I expect your cooking smells as good to her as it does to me."" I took up the two packages and gave the bread to the little girl, the woman all iron-gray behind the counter, watching us with cold certitude. ""You wait a minute,"" she said. She went to the rear. The door opened again and closed. The little girl watched me, holding the bread against her dirty dress. ""What's your name?"" I said. She quit looking at me, bu she was still motionless. She didn't even seem to breathe. The woman returned. She had a funny looking thing in her hand. She carried it sort of like it might have been a dead pet rat. ""Here,"" she said. The child looked at her. ""Take it,"" the woman said, jabbing it at the little girl. ""It just looks peculiar. I calculate you wont know the difference when you eat it. Here. I cant stand here all day."" The child took it, still watching her. The woman rubbed her hands on her apron. ""I got to have that bell fixed,"" she said. She went to the door and jerked it open. The little bell tinkled once, faint and clear and invisible. We moved toward the door and the woman's peering back. ""Thank you for the cake,"" I said. ""Them foreigners,"" she said, staring up into the obscurity where the bell tinkled. ""Take my advice and stay clear of them, young man."" ""Yessum,"" I said. ""Come on, sister."" We went out. ""Thank you, ma'am."" She swung the door to, then jerked it open again, making the bell give forth its single small note. ""Foreigners,"" she said, peering up at the bell. We went on. ""Well,"" I said. ""How about some ice cream?"" She was eating the gnarled cake. ""Do you like ice cream?"" She gave me a black still look, chewing. ""Come on."" We came to the drugstore and had some ice cream. She wouldn't put the loaf down. ""Why not put it down so you can eat better?"" I said, offering to take it. But she held to it, chewing the ice cream like it was taffy. The bitten cake lay on the table. She ate the ice cream steadily, then she fell to on the cake again, looking about at the showcases. I finished mine and we went out. ""Which way do you live?"" I said. A buggy, the one with the white horse it was. Only Doc Peabody is fat. Three hundred pounds. You ride with him on the uphill side, holding on. Children. Walking easier than holding uphill. Seen the doctor yet have you seen Caddy I dont have to I cant ask now afterward it will be all right it wont matter Because women so delicate so mysterious Father said. Delicate equilibrium of periodical filth between two moons balanced. Moons he said full and yellow as harvest moons her hips thighs. Outside outside of them always but. Yellow. Feet soles with walking like. Then know that some man that all those mysterious and imperious concealed. With all that inside of them shapes an outward suavity waiting for a touch to. Liquid putrefaction like drowned things floating like pale rubber flabbily filled getting the odor of honeysuckle all mixed up. ""You'd better take your bread on home, hadn't you?"" She looked at me. She chewed quietly and steadily; at regular intervals a small distension passed smoothly down her throat. I opened my package and gave her one of the buns. ""Goodbye,"" I said. I went on. Then I looked back. She was behind me. ""Do you live down this way?"" She said nothing. She walked beside me, under my elbow sort of, eating. We went on. It was quiet, hardly anyone about getting the odor of honeysuckle all mixed She would have told me not to let me sit there on the steps hearing her door twilight slamming hearing Benjy still crying Supper she would have to come down then getting honeysuckle all mixed up in it We reached the corner. ""Well, I've got to go down this way,"" I said. ""Goodbye."" She stopped too. She swallowed the last of the cake, then she began on the bun, watching me across it. ""Goodbye,"" I said. I turned into the street and went on, but I went to the next corner before I stopped. ""Which way do you live?"" I said. ""This way?"" I pointed down the street. She just looked at me. ""Do you live over that way? I bet you live close to the station, where",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,51,"the trains are. Dont you?"" She just looked at me, serene and secret and chewing. The street was empty both ways, with quiet lawns and houses neat among the trees, but no one at all except back there. We turned and went back. Two men sat in chairs in front of a store. ""Do you all know this little girl? She sort of took up with me and I cant find where she lives."" They quit looking at me and looked at her. ""Must be one of them new Italian families,"" one said. He wore a rusty frock coat. ""I've seen her before. What's your name, little girl?"" looked at them blackly for a while, her jaws moving steadily. She swallowed without ceasing to chew. ""Maybe she cant speak English,"" the other said. ""They sent her after bread,"" I said. ""She must be able to speak something."" ""What's your pa's name?"" the first said. ""Pete? Joe? name John huh?"" She took another bite from the bun. ""What must I do with her?"" I said. ""She just follows me. I've got to get back to Boston."" ""You from the college?"" ""Yes, sir. And I've got to get on back."" ""You might go up the street and turn her over to Anse. He'll be up at the livery stable. The marshal."" ""I reckon that's what I'll have to do,"" I said. ""I've got to do something with her. Much obliged. Come on, sister."" We went up the street, on the shady side, where the shadow of the broken facade blotted slowly across the road. We came to the livery stable. The marshal wasn't there. A man sitting in a chair tilted in the broad low door, where a dark cool breeze smelling of ammonia blew among the ranked stalls, said to look at the postoffice. He didn't know her either. ""Them furriners. I cant tell one from another. You might take her across the tracks where they live, and maybe somebody'll claim her."" We went to the postoflice. It was back down the street. The man in the frock coat was opening a newspaper. ""Anse just drove out of town,"" he said. ""I guess you'd better go down past the station and walk past them houses by the river. Somebody there'll know her."" ""I guess I'll have to,"" I said. ""Come on, sister."" She pushed the last piece of the bun into her mouth and swallowed it. ""Want another?"" I said. She looked at me, chewing, her eyes black and unwinking and friendly. I took the other two buns out and gave her one and bit into the other. I asked a man where the station was and he showed me. ""Come on, sister."" We reached the station and crossed the tracks, where the river was. A bridge crossed it, and a street of jumbled frame houses followed the river, backed onto it. A shabby street, but with an air heterogeneous and vivid too. In the center of an untrimmed plot enclosed by a fence of gaping and broken pickets stood an ancient lopsided surrey and a weathered house from an upper window of which hung a garment of vivid pink. ""Does that look like your house?"" I said. She looked at me over the bun. ""This one?"" I said, pointing. She just chewed, but it seemed to me that I discerned something affirmative, acquiescent even if it wasn't eager, in her air. ""This one?"" I said. ""Come on, then."" I entered the broken gate. I looked back at her. ""Here?"" I said. ""This look like your house?"" She nodded her head rapidly, looking at me, gnawing into the damp halfmoon of the bread. We went on. A walk of broken random flags, speared by fresh coarse blades of grass, led to the broken stoop. There was no movement about the house at all, and the pink garment hanging in no wind from the upper window. There was a bell pull with a porcelain knob, attached to about six feet of wire when I stopped pulling and knocked. The little girl had the crust edgeways in her chewing mouth. A woman opened the door. She looked at me, then she spoke rapidly to the little girl in Italian, with a rising inflexion, then a pause, interrogatory. She spoke to her again the little girl looking at her across the end of the crust, pushing it into her mouth with a dirty hand ""She says she lives here."" I said. ""I met her down town. Is this your bread? ""No spika,"" the woman said. She spoke to the little girl again. The little girl just looked at her. ""No live here?"" I said. I pointed to the girl, then at her, then at the door. The woman shook her head. She spoke rapidly.",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,52,"She came to the edge of the porch and pointed down the road, speaking. I nodded violently too. ""You come show?"" I said. I took her arm, waving my other hand toward the road. She spoke swiftly, pointing. ""You come show,"" I said, trying to lead her down the steps. ""Si, si,"" she said, holding back, showing me whatever it was. I nodded again. ""Thanks. Thanks. Thanks."" I went down the steps and walked toward the gate, not running, but pretty fast. I reached the gate and stopped and looked at her for a while. The crust was gone now, and she looked at me with her black, friendly stare. The woman stood on the stoop, watching us. ""Come on, then,"" I said. ""We'll have to find the right one sooner or later."" She moved along just under my elbow. We went on. The houses all seemed empty. Not a soul in sight. A sort of breathlessness that empty houses have. Yet they couldn't all be empty. All the different rooms, if you could just slice the walls away all of a sudden. Madam, your daughter, if you please. No. Madam, for God's sake, your daughter. She moved along just under my elbow, her shiny tight pigtails, and then the last house played out and the road curved out of sight beyond a wall, following the river. The woman was emerging from the broken gate, with a shawl over ner head and clutched under her chary. The road curved on, empty. I found a coin and gave it to the little girl. A quarter. ""Goodbye, sister,"" I said. Then I ran. I ran fast, not looking back. Just before the road curved away I looked back. She stood in the road, a small figure clasping the loaf of bread to her filthv little dress, her eyes still and black and unwinking I ran on A lane turned from the road. I entered it and after a while I slowed to a fast walk. The lane went between back premises-- unpainted houses with more of those gay and startling colored garments on lines, a barn broken- backed, decaying quietly among rank orchard trees, unpruned and weed- choked, pink and white and murmurous with sunlight and with bees. I looked back. The entrance to the lane was empty. I slowed still more, my shadow pacing me, dragging its head through the weeds that hid the fence. The lane went back to a barred gate, became defunctive in grass, a mere path scarred quietly into new grass. I climbed the gate into a woodlot and crossed it and came to another wall and followed that one, my shadow behind me now. There were vines and creepers where at home would be honeysuckle. Coming and coming especially in the dusk when it rained, getting honeysuckle all mixed up in it as though it were not enough without that, not unbearable enough. What did you let him for kiss kiss I didn't let him I made him watching me getting mad What do you think of that? Red print of my hand coming up through her face like turning a light on under your hand her eyes going bright It's not for kissing I slapped you. Girl's elbows at fifteen Father said you swallow like you had a fishbone in your throat what's the matter with you and Caddy across the table not to look at me. It's for letting it be some darn town squirt I slapped you you will will you now I guess you say calf rope. My red hand coming up out of her face. What do you think of that scouring her head into the. Grass sticks cries-crossed into the flesh tingling scouring her head. Say calf rope say it I didn't kiss a dirty girl like Natalie anyway The wall went into shadow, and then my shadow, I had tricked it again. I had forgot about the river curving along the road. I climbed the wall. And then she watched me jump down, holding the loaf against her dress. I stood in the weeds and we looked at one another for a while. ""Why didn't you tell me you lived out this way, sister?"" The loaf was wearing slowly out of the paper; already it needed a new one. ""Well, come on then and show me the house."" not a dirty girl like Natalie. It was raining we could hear it on the roof, sighing through the high sweet emptiness of the barn. There? touching her Not there There? not raining hard but we couldn't hear anything but the roof and if it was my blood or her blood She pushed me down the ladder and ran off and left me Caddy did Was it there it hurt you",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,53,"when Caddy did ran off was it there Oh She walked just under my elbow, the top of her patent leather head, the loaf fraying out of the newspaper. ""If you dont get home pretty soon you're going to wear that loaf out. And then what'll your mamma say?"" I bet I can lift you up You cant I'm too heavy Did Caddy go away did she go to the house you cant see the barn from our house did you ever try to see the barn from It was her fault she pushed me she ran away I can lift you up see how I can Oh her blood or my blood Oh We went on in the thin dust, our feet silent as rubber in the thin dust where pencils of sun slanted in the trees. And I could feel water again running swift and peaceful in the secret shade. ""You live a long way, dont you. You're mighty smart to go this far to town by yourself."" It's like dancing sitting down did you ever dance sitting down? We could hear the rain, a rat in the crib, the empty barn vacant with horses. How do you hold to dance do you hold like this Oh I used to hold like this you thought I wasn't strong enough didn't you Oh Oh Oh Oh I hold to use like this I mean did you hear what I said I said oh oh oh oh The road went on, still and empty, the sun slanting more and more. Her stiff little Pigtails were bound at the tips with bits of crimson cloth. A corner of the wrapping flapped a little as she walked, the nose of the loaf naked. I stopped. ""Look here. Do you live down this road? We haven't passed a house in a mile, almost."" She looked at me, black and secret and friendly. ""Where do you live, sister? Dont you live back there in town?"" There was a bird somewhere in the woods, beyond the broken and infrequent slanting of sunlight. ""Your Papa's going to be worried about you. Dont you reckon you'll get a whipping for not coming straight home with that bread?"" The bird whistled again, invisible, a sound meaningless and profound, inflexionless, ceasing as though cut off with the blow of a knife, and again, and that sense of water swift and peaceful above secret places, felt, not seen not heard. ""Oh, hell, sister."" About half the paper hung limp. ""That's not doing any good now."" I tore it off and dropped it beside the road. ""Come on. We'll have to go back to town. We'll go back along the river."" We left the road. Among the moss little pale flowers grew, and the sense of water mute and unseen. I hold to use like this I mean I use to hold She stood in the door looking at us her hands on her hips You pushed me it was your fault it hurt me too We were dancing sitting down I bet Caddy cant dance sitting down Stop that stop that I was just brushing the trash off the back of your dress You keep your nasty old hands off of me it was your fault you pushed me down I'm mad at you I dont care she looked at us stay mad she went away We began to hear the shouts, the splashings; I saw a brown body gleam for an instant. Stay mad. My shirt was getting wet and my hair. Across the roof hearing the roof loud now I could see Natalie going through the garden among the rain. Get wet I hope you catch pneumonia go on home Cowface. I jumped hard as I could into the hogwallow the mud yellowed up to my waist stinking I kept on plunging until I fell down and rolled over in it ""Hear them in swimming, sister? I wouldn't mind doing that myself."" If I had time. When I have time. I could hear my watch. mud was warmer than the rain it smelled awful. She had her back turned I went around in front of her. You know what I was doing? She turned her back I went around in front of her the rain creeping into the mud flatting her bod ice through her dress it smelled horrible. I was hugging her that's what I was doing. She turned her back I went around in front of her. I was hugging her I tell you. I dont give a damn what you were doing You dont you dont I'll make you I'll make you give a damn. She hit my hands away I smeared mud on her with the other hand I couldn't feel the wet smacking",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,54,"of her hand I wiped mud from my legs smeared it on her wet hard turning body hearing her fingers going into my face but I couldn't feel it even when the rain began to taste sweet on my lips They saw us from the water first, heads and shoulders. They yelled and one rose squatting and sprang among them. They looked like beavers, the water ripping about their chins, yelling. ""Take that girl awayl What did you want to bring a girl here for? Go on awayl"" ""She wont hurt you. We just want to watch you for a while."" They squatted in the water. Their heads drew into a clump, atching us, then they broke and rushed toward us, hurling water with their hands. We moved quick. ""Look out, boys; she wont hurt you."" ""Go on away, Harvard!"" It was the second boy, the one that thought the horse and wagon back there at the bridge. ""Splash them, fellows!"" ""Let's get out and throw them in,"" another said. ""I aint afraid of any girl."" "" Splash them! Splash them!"" They rushed toward us, hurling water. We moved back. ""Go on away!"" they yelled. ""Go on away!"" We went away. They huddled just under the bank, their slick heads in a row against the bright water. We went on. ""That's not for us, is it."" The sun slanted through to the moss here and there, leveller. ""Poor kid, you're just a girl."" Little flowers grew among the moss, littler than I had ever seen. ""You're just a girl. Poor kid."" There was a path, curving along beside the water. Then the water was still again, dark and still and swift. ""Nothing but a girl. Poor sister."" We lay in the wet grass panting the rain like cold shot on my back. Do you care now do you do you My Lord we sure are in a mess get up. Where the rain touched my forehead it began to smart my hand came red away streaking off pink in the rain. Does it hurt Of course it does what do you reckon I tried to scratch your eyes out my Lord we sure do stink we better try to wash it off in the branch ""There's town again, sister. You'll have to go home now. I've got to get back to school. Look how late it's getting. You'll go home now, wont you?"" But she just looked at me with her black, secret, friendly gaze, the half-naked loaf clutched to her breast. ""It's wet. I thought we jumped back in time."" I took my handkerchief and tried to wipe the loaf, but the crust began to come off, so I stopped. ""We'll just have to let it dry itself. Hold it like this."" She held it like that. It looked kind of like rats had been eating it now. and the water building and building up the squatting back the sloughed mud stinking surfaceward pocking the pattering surface like grease on a hot stove. I told you I'd make you I dont give a goddam what you do Then we heard the running and we stopped and looked back and saw him coming up the path running, the level shadows flicking upon his legs. ""He's in a hurry. We'd--"" then I saw another man, an oldish man running heavily, clutching a stick, and a boy naked from the waist up, clutching his pants as he ran. "" There's Julio,"" the little girl said, and then I saw his Italian face and his eyes as he sprang upon me. We went down. His hands were jabbing at my face and he was saying something and trying to bite me, I reckon, and then they hauled him off and held him heaving and thrashing and yelling and they held his arms and he tried to kick me until they dragged him back. The little girl was howling, holding the loaf in both arms. The half naked boy was darting and jumping up and down, clutching his trousers and someone pulled me up in time to see another stark naked figure come around the tranquil bend in the path running and change direction in midstride and leap into the woods, a couple of garments rigid as boards behind it. Julio still struggled. The man who had pulled me up said, ""Whoa, now. We got you."" He wore a vest but no coat. Upon it was a met shield In his other hand he clutched a knotted, polished stick. "" You're Anse, aren't you?"" I said. ""I was looking for you. What's the matter?"" ""I warn you that anything you say will be used aganst you,"" he said. ""You're under arrest."" "" I killa heem,"" Julio said. He struggled. Two men held him. The",no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
sound-and-fury,55,"little girl howled steadily, holding the bread. ""You steala my seester,"" Julio said. ""Let go, meesters."" "" Steal his sister?"" I said. ""Why, I've been--"" ""Shet up,"" Anse said. ""You can tell that to Squire."" "" Steal his sister?"" I said. Julio broke from the men and sprang at me again, but the marshal met him and they struggled until the other two pinioned his arms again. Anse released him, panting. ""You durn furriner,"" he said. ""I've a good mind to take you up too, for assault and battery."" He turned to me again. ""Will you come peaceable, or do I handcuff you?"" ""I'll come peaceable,"" I said. ""Anything, just so I can find someone--do something with-- Stole his sister,"" I said. ""Stole his--"" "" I've warned you,"" Anse said. ""He aims to charge you with meditated criminal assault. Here, you, make that gal shut up that noise."" ""Oh,"" I said. Then I began to laugh. Two more boys with plastered heads and round eyes came out of the bushes, buttoning shirts that had already dampened onto their shoulders and arms, and I tried to stop the laughter, but I couldn't. ""Watch him, Anse, he's crazy, I believe."" ""I'll h-have to qu-quit,"" I said. ""It'll stop in a mu-minute. The other time it said ah ah ah,"" I said, laughing. ""Let me sit down a while."" I sat down, they watching me, and the little girl with her streaked face and the gnawed looking loaf, and the water swif and peaceful below the path. After a while the laughter ran out. But my throat wouldn't quit trying to laugh, like retching after your stomach is empty. ""Whoa, now,"" Anse said. ""Get a grip on yourself."" ""Yes,"" I said, tightening my throat. There was another yellow butterfly, like one of the sunflecks had come loose. After a while I didn't have to hold my throat so tight. I got up. ""I'm ready. Which way?"" We followed the path, the two others watching Julio and the little girl and the boys somewhere in the rear. The path went along the river to the bridge. We crossed it and the tracks, people coming to the doors to look at us and more boys materialising from somewhere until when we turned into the main street we had quite a procession. Before the drug store stood an auto, a big one, but I didn't recognise them until Mrs Bland said, "" Why, Quentin! Quentin Compson!"" Then I saw Gerald, and Spoade in the back seat, sitting on the back of his neck. And Shreve. I didn't know the two girls. ""Quentin Compson!"" Mrs Bland said. "" Good afternoon,"" I said, raising my hat. ""I'm under arrest. I'm sorry I didn't get your note. Did Shreve tell you?"" ""Under arrest?"" Shreve said. ""Excuse me,"" he said. He heaved himself up and climbed over their feet and got out. He had on a pair of my flannel pants, like a glove. I didn't remember forgetting them. I didn't remember how many chins Mrs Bland had, either. The prettiest girl was with Gerald in front, too. They watched me through veils, with a kind of delicate horror. ""Who's under arrest?"" Shreve said. ""What's this, mister?"" ""Gerald,"" Mrs Bland said. ""Send these people away. You get in this car, Quentin."" Gerald got out. Spoade hadn't moved. ""What's he done, Cap?"" he said. ""Robbed a hen house?"" ""I warn you,"" Anse said. ""Do you know the prisoner?"" ""Know him,"" Shreve said. ""Look here--"" ""Then you can come along to the squire's. You'reobstructing justice. Come along."" He shook my arm. ""Well, good afternoon,"" I said. ""I'm glad to have seen you all. Sorry I couldn't be with you."" ""You, Gerald,"" Mrs Bland said. ""Look here, constable,"" Gerald said. ""I warn you you're interfering with an officer of the law,"" Anse said. ""If you've anything to say, you can come to the squire's and make cognizance of the prisoner."" We went on. Quite a procession now, Anse and I leading. I could hear them telling them what it was, and Spoade asking questions, and then Julio said something violently in Italian and I looked back and saw the little girl standing at the curb, looking at me with her friendly, inscrutable regard. ""Git on home,"" Julio shouted at her. ""I beat hell outa you."" We went down the street and turned into a bit of lawn in which, set back from the street, stood a one storey building of brick trimmed with white. We went up the rock path to the door, where Anse halted everyone except us and made them remain outside. We entered, a bare room smelling of stale tobacco. There was a sheet iron stove in the center of a wooden frame filled with sand, and a faded map",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,56,"on the wall and the dingy plat of a township. Behind a scarred littered table a man with a fierce roach of iron gray hair peered at us over steel spectacles. ""Got him, did ye, Anse?"" he said. ""Got him, Squire."" He opened a huge dusty book and drew it to him and dipped a foul pen into an inkwell filled with what looked like coal dust. ""Look here, mister,"" Shreve said. ""The prisoner's name,"" the squire said. I told him. He wrote it slowly into the book, the pen scratching with excruciating deliberation. ""Look here, mister,"" Shreve said. ""We know this fellow. We--"" ""Order in the court,"" Anse said. ""Shut up, bud,"" Spoade said. ""Let him do it his way. He's going to anyhow."" ""Age,"" the squire said. I told him. He wrote that, his mouth moving as he wrote. ""Occupation."" I told him. ""Harvard student, hey?"" he said. He looked up at me, bowing his neck a little to see over the spectacles. His eyes were clear and cold, like a goat's. ""What are you up to, coming out here kidnapping children?"" ""They're crazy, Squire,"" Shreve said. ""Whoever says this boy's kidnapping--"" Julio moved violently. ""Crazy?"" he said. ""Dont I catcha heem, eh? Dont I see weetha my own eyes-"" ""You're a liar,"" Shreve said. ""You never--"" ""Order, order,"" Anse said, raising his voice. ""You fellers shet up,"" the squire said. ""If they dont stay quiet, turn 'em out, Anse."" They got quiet. The squire looked at Shreve, then at Spoade, then at Gerald. ""You know this young man?"" he said to Spoade. ""Yes, your honor,"" Spoade said. ""He's just a country boy in school up there. He dont mean any harm. I think the marshal'll find it's a mistake. His father's a congregational minister."" ""H'm,"" the squire said. ""What was you doing, exactly?"" I told him, he watching me with his cold, pale eyes. ""How about it, Anse?"" ""Might have been,"" Anse said. ""Them durn furriners."" ""I American,"" Julio said. ""I gotta da pape'."" ""Where's the gal?"" ""He sent her home,"" Anse said. ""Was she scared or anything?"" ""Not till Julio there jumped on the prisoner. They were just walking along the river path, towards town. Some boys swimming told us which way they went."" ""It's a mistake, Squire,"" Spoade said. ""Children and dogs are always taking up with him like that. He cant help it."" ""H'm,"" the squire said. He looked out of the window for a while. We watched him. I could hear Julio scratching himself. The squire looked back. ""Air you satisfied the gal aint took any hurt, you, there?"" ""No hurt now,"" Julio said sullenly. ""You quit work to hunt for her?"" ""Sure I quit. I run. I run like hell. Looka here, looka there, then man tella me he seen him give her she eat. She go weetha."" ""H'm,"" the squire said. ""Well, son, I calculate you owe Julio something for taking him away from his work."" ""Yes, sir,"" I said. ""How much?"" ""Dollar, I calculate."" I gave Julio a dollar. ""Well,"" Spoade said. ""If that's all--I reckon he's discharged, your honor?"" The squire didn't look at him. ""How far'd you run him, Anse?"" ""Two miles, at least. It was about two hours before we caught him."" ""H'm,"" the squire said. He mused a while. We watched him, his stiff crest, the spectacles riding low on his nose. The yellow shape of the window grew slowly across the floor, reached the wall, climbing. Dust motes whirled and slanted. ""Six dollars."" ""Six dollars?"" Shreve said. ""What's that for?"" ""Six dollars,"" the squire said. He looked at Shreve a moment, then at me again. ""Look here,"" Shreve said. ""Shut up,"" Spoade said. ""Give it to him, bud, and let's get out of here. The ladies are waiting for us. You got six dollars?"" ""Yes,"" I said. I gave him six dollars. ""Case dismissed,"" he said. ""You get a receipt,"" Shreve said. ""You get a signed receipt for that money."" The squire looked at Shreve mildly. ""Case dismissed,"" he said without raising his voice. ""I'll be damned--"" Shreve said. ""Come on here,"" Spoade said, taking his arm. ""Good afternoon, Judge. Much obliged."" As we passed out the door Julio's voice rose again, violent, then ceased. Spoade was looking at me, his brown eyes quizzical, a little cold. ""Well, bud, I reckon you'll do your girl chasing in Boston after this."" ""You damned fool,"" Shreve said. ""What the hell do you mean anyway, straggling off here, fooling with these damn wops?"" ""Come on,"" Spoade said. ""They must be getting impatient."" Mrs Bland was talking to them. They were Miss Holmes and Miss Daingerfield and they quit listening to her and looked at me again with that delicate and curious horror, their veils turned back upon their",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,57,"little white noses and their eyes fleeing and mysterious beneath the veils. ""Quentin Compson,"" Mrs Bland said. ""What would your mother say. A young man naturally gets into scrapes, but to be arrested on foot by a country policeman. What did they think he'd done, Gerald?"" ""Nothing,"" Gerald said. ""Nonsense. What was it, you, Spoade?"" ""He was trying to kidnap that little dirty girl, but they caught him in time,"" Spoade said. ""Nonsense,"" Mrs Bland said, but her voice sort of died away and she stared at me for a moment, and the girls drew their breaths in with a soft concerted sound. ""Fiddlesticks,"" Mrs Bland said briskly. ""If that isn't just like these ignorant lowclass Yankees. Get in, Quentin."" Shreve and I sat on two small collapsible seats. Gerald cranked the car and got in and we started. ""Now, Quentin, you tell me what all this foolishness is about,"" Mrs Bland said. I told them, Shreve hunched and furious on his little seat and Spoade sitting again on the back of his neck beside Miss Daingerfield. ""And the joke is, all the time Quentin had us all fooled,"" Spoade said. ""All the time we thought he was the model youth that anybody could trust a daughter with, until the police showed him up at his nefarious work."" ""Hush up, Spoade,"" Mrs Bland said. We drove down the street and crossed the bridge and passed the house where the pink garment hung in the window. ""That's what you get for not reading my note. Why didn't you come and get it? Mr MacKenzie says he told you it was there."" ""Yessum. I intended to, but I never went back to the room."" ""You'd have let us sit there waiting I dont know how long, if it hadn't been for Mr MacKenzie. When he said you hadn't come back, that left an extra place, so we asked him to come. We're very glad to have you anyway, Mr MacKenzie."" Shreve said nothing. His arms were folded and he glared straight ahead past Gerald's cap. It was a cap for motoring in England. Mrs Bland said so. We passed that house, and three others, and another yard where the little girl stood by the gate. She didn't have the bread now, and her face looked like it had been streaked with coaldust. I waved my hand, but she made no reply, only her head turned slowly as the car passed, following us with her unwinking gaze. Then we ran beside the wall, our shadows running along the wall, and after a while we passed a piece of torn newspaper lying beside the road and I began to laugh again. I could feel it in my throat and I looked off into the trees where the afternoon slanted, thinking of afternoon and of the bird and the boys in swimming. But still I couldn't stop it and then I knew that if I tried too hard to stop it I'd be crying and I thought about how I'd thought about I could not be a virgin, with so many of them walking along in the shadows and whispering with their soft girlvoices lingering in the shadowy places and the words coming out and perfume and eyes you could feel not see, but if it was that simple to do it wouldn't be anything and if it wasn't anything, what was I and then Mrs Bland said, ""Quentin? Is he sick, Mr MacKenzie?"" and then Shreve's fat hand touched my knee and Spoade began talking and I quit trying to stop it. ""If that hamper is in his way, Mr MacKenzie, move it over on your side. I brought a hamper of wine because I think young gentlemen should drink wine, although my father, Gerald's grandfather "" ever do that Have you ever done that In the gray darkness a little light her hands locked about ""They do, when they can get it,"" Spoade said. ""Hey, Shreve?"" her knees her face looking at the sky the smell of honeysuckle upon her face and throat ""Beer, too,"" Shreve said. His hand touched my knee again. I moved my knee again. like a thin wash of lilac colored paint talking about him bringing ""You're not a gentleman,"" Spoade said. him between us until the shape of her blurred not with dark ""No. I'm Canadian,"" Shreve said. talking about him the oar blades winking him along winking the Cap made for motoring in England and all time rushing beneath and they two blurred within the other forever more he had been in the army had killed men ""I adore Canada,"" Miss Daingerfield said. ""I think it's marvellous."" ""Did you ever drink perfume?"" Spoade said. with one hand he could lift her to his shoulder and run with",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no

He wouldn't even let old Wilkie touch it do you remember Gerald but always gathered it himself and made his own julep. He was as crotchety about his julep as an old maid, measuring everything by a recipe in his head. There was only one man he ever gave that recipe to; that was "" we did how can you not know it if youll just wait Ill tell you how it was it was a crime we did a terrible crime it cannot be hid you think it can but wait Poor Quentin youve never done that have you and Ill tell you how it was Ill tell Father then itll have to be because you love Father then well have to go away amid the pointing and the horror the clean flame Ill make you say we did Im stronger than you Ill make you know we did you thought it was them but it was me listen I fooled you all the time it was me you thought I was in the house where that damn honeysuckle trying not to think the swing the cedars the secret surges the breathing locked drinking the wild breath the yes Yes Yes yes ""never be got to drink wine himself, but he always said that a hamper what book did you read that in the one where Gerald's rowing suit of wine was a necessary part of any gentlemen's picnic basket"" did you love them Caddy did you love them When they touched me I died one minute she was standing there the next he was yelling and pulling at her dress they went into the hall and up the stairs yelling and shoving at her up the stairs to the bathroom door and stopped her back against the door and her arm across her face yelling and trying to shove her into the bathroom when she came in to supper T.

I could hear Shreve working the pump, then he came back with the basin and a round blob of twilight wobbling in it, with a yellow edge like a fading balloon, then my reflection. I tried to see my face in it. ""Has it stopped?"" Shreve said. ""Give me the rag."" He tried to take it from my hand. ""Look out,"" I said. ""I can do it. Yes, it's about stopped now."" I dipped the rag again, breaking the balloon. The rag stained the water. ""I wish I had a clean one."" ""You need a piece of beefsteak for that eye,"" Shreve said. ""Damn if you wont have a shiner tomorrow. The son of a bitch,"" he said. ""Did I hurt him any?"" I wrung out the handkerchief and tried to clean the blood off of my vest. ""You cant get that off,"" Shreve said. ""You'll have to send it to the cleaner's. Come on, hold it on your eye, why dont you. ""I can get some of it off,"" I said. But I wasn't doing much good. ""What sort of shape is my collar in?"" ""I dont know,"" Shreve said. ""Hold it against your eye. Here."" ""Look out,"" I said. ""I can do it. Did I hurt him any?"" ""You may have hit him. I may have looked away just then or blinked or something. He boxed the hell out of you. He boxed you all over the place. What did you want to fight him with your fists for? You goddam fool. How do you feel?"" ""I feel fine,"" I said. ""I wonder if I can get something to clean my vest."" ""Oh, forget your damn clothes. Does your eye hurt?"" ""I feel fine,"" I said. Everything was sort of violet and still, the sky green paling into gold beyond the gable of the house and a plume of smoke rising from the chimney without any wind. I heard the pump again. A man was filling a pail, watching us across his pumping shoulder. A woman crossed the door, but she didn't look out. I could hear a cow lowing somewhere. ""Come on,"" Shreve said. ""Let your clothes alone and put that rag on your eye. I'll send your suit out first thing tomorrow."" ""All right. I'm sorry I didn't bleed on him a little, at least."" ""Son of a bitch,"" Shreve said. Spoade came out of the house, talking to the woman I reckon, and crossed the yard. He looked at me with his cold, quizzical eyes. ""Well, bud,"" he said, looking at me, ""I'll be damned if you dont go to a lot of trouble to have your fun. Kidnapping, then fighting. What do you do on your holidays? burn houses?"" ""I'm all right,"" I said. ""What did Mrs Bland say?"" ""She's giving Gerald hell for bloodying you up. She'll give you hell for letting him, when she sees you. She dont object to the fighting, it's the blood that annoys her. I think you lost caste with her a little by not holding your blood better. How do you feel?"" ""Sure,"" Shreve said. ""If you cant be a Bland, the next best thing is to commit adultery with one or get drunk and fight him, as the case may be."" ""Quite right,"" Spoade said. ""But I didn't know Quentin was drunk."" ""He wasn't,"" Shreve said. ""Do you have to be drunk to want to hit that son of a bitch?"" ""Well, I think I'd have to be pretty drunk to try it, after seeing how Quentin came out. Where'd he learn to box?"" ""He's been going to Mike's every day, over in town,"" I said. ""He has?"" Spoade said. ""Did you know that when you hit him?"" ""I dont know,"" I said. ""I guess so. Yes."" ""Wet it again,"" Shreve said. ""Want some fresh water?"" ""This is all right,"" I said. I dipped",no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes

""I dont know. I dont know why I did."" ""The first I knew was when you jumped up all of a sudden and said, 'Did you ever have a sister? did you?' and when he said No, you hit him. I noticed you kept on looking at him, but you didn't seem to be paying any attention to what anybody was saying until you jumped up and asked him if he had any sisters."" ""Ah, he was blowing off as usual,"" Shreve said, ""about his women. You know: like he does, before girls, so they dont know exactly what he's saying. All his damn innuendo and lying and a lot of stuff that dont make sense even. Telling us about some wench that he made a date with to meet at a dance hall in Atlantic City and stood her up and went to the hotel and went to bed and how he lay there being sorry for her waiting on the pier for him, without him there to give her what she wanted. Talking about the body's beauty and the sorry ends thereof and how tough women have it, without anything else they can do except lie on their backs. Leda lurking in the bushes, whimpering and moaning for the swan, see. The son of a bitch. I'd hit him myself. Only I'd grabbed up her damn hamper of wine and done it if it had been me."" ""Oh,"" Spoade said, ""the champion of dames. Bud, you excite not only admiration, but horror."" He looked at me, cold and quizzical. ""Good God,"" he said. ""I'm sorry I hit him,"" I said. ""Do I look too bad to go back and get it over with?"" ""Apologies, hell,"" Shreve said. ""Let them go to hell. We're going to town."" ""He ought to go back so they'll know he fights like a gentleman,"" Spoade said. ""Gets licked like one, I mean."" ""Like this?"" Shreve said. ""With his clothes all over blood?"" ""Why, all right,"" Spoade said. ""You know best."" ""He cant go around in his undershirt,"" Shreve said. ""He's not a senior yet. Come on, let's go to town."" ""You needn't come,"" I said. ""You go on back to the picnic."" ""Hell with them,"" Shreve said. ""Come on here."" ""What'll I tell them?"" Spoade said. ""Tell them you and Quentin had a fight too?"" ""Tell them nothing,"" Shreve said. ""Tell her her option expired at sunset. Come on, Quentin. I'll ask that woman where the nearest interurban--"" ""No,"" I said. ""I'm not going back to town."" Shreve stopped, looking at me. Turning his glasses looked like small yellow moons. ""What are you going to do?"" ""I'm not going back to town yet. You go on back to the picnic. Tell them I wouldn't come back because my clothes were spoiled."" ""Look here,"" he said. ""What are you up to?"" ""Nothing. I'm all right. You and Spoade go on back. I'll see you tomorrow."" I went on across the yard, toward the road. ""Do you know where the station is?"" Shreve said. ""I'll find it. I'll see you all tomorrow. Tell Mrs Bland I'm sorry I spoiled her party."" They stood watching me. I went around the house. A rock path went down to the road. Roses grew on both sides of the path. I went through the gate, onto the road. It dropped downhill, toward the woods, and I could make out the auto beside the road. I went up the hill. The light increased as I mounted, and before I reached the top I heard a car. It sounded far away across the twilight and I stopped and listened to it. I couldn't make out the auto any longer, but Shreve was standing in the road before the house, looking up the hill. Behind him the yellow light lay like a wash of paint on the roof of the house. I lifted my hand and went on over the hill, listening to the car. Then the house was gone and I stopped in the green and yellow light and heard the car growing louder and louder, until just as it began to die away it ceased all together. I waited until I heard it start again. Then I went on. As I descended the light dwindled slowly, yet at the same time without altering its quality, as if I and not light were changing, decreasing, though even when the road ran into trees you could have read a newspaper. Pretty soon I came to a lane. I turned into it. It was closer and darker",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no
sound-and-fury,65,"than the road, but when it came out at the trolley stop--another wooden marquee-- the light was still unchanged. After the lane it seemed brighter, as though I had walked through night in the lane and come out into morning again. Pretty soon the car came. I got on it, they turning to look at my eye, and found a seat on the left side. The lights were on in the car, so while we ran between trees I couldn't see anything except my own face and a woman across the aisle with a hat sitting right on top of her head, with a broken feather in it, but when we ran out of the trees I could see the twilight again, that quality of light as if time really had stopped for a while, with the sun hanging just under the horizon, and then we passed the marquee where the old man had been eating out of the sack, and the road going on under the twilight, into twilight and the sense of water peaceful and swift beyond. Then the car went on, the draft building steadily up in the open door until it was drawing steadily through the car with the odor of summer and darkness except honeysuckle. Honeysuckle was the saddest odor of all, I think. I remember lots of them. Wistaria was one. On the rainy days when Mother wasn't feeling quite bad enough to stay away from the windows we used to play under it. When Mother stayed in bed Dilsey would put old clothes on us and let us go out in the rain because she said rain never hurt young folks. But if Mother was up we always began by playing on the porch until she said we were making too much noise, then we went out and played under the wisteria frame. This was where I saw the river for the last time this morning, about here. I could feel water beyond the twilight, smell. When it bloomed in the spring and it rained the smell was everywhere you didn't notice it so much at other times but when it rained the smell began to come into the house at twilight either it would rain more at twilight or there was something in the light itself but it always smelled strongest then until I would lie in bed thinking when will it stop when will it stop. The draft in the door smelled of water, a damp steady breath. Sometimes I could put myself to sleep saying that over and over until after the honeysuckle got all mixed up in it the whole thing came to symbolis night and unrest I seemed to be lying neither asleep nor awake looking down a long corridor of gray halflight where all stable things had become shadowy paradoxical all I had done shadows all I had felt suffered taking visible form antic and perverse mocking without relevance inherent themselves with the denial of the significance they should have affirmed thinking I was I was not who was not was not who. I could smell the curves of the river beyond the dusk and I saw the last light supine and tranquil upon tideflats like pieces of broken mirror, then beyond them lights began in the pale clear air, trembling a little like butterflies hovering a long way off. Benjamin the child of. How he used to sit before that mirror. Refuge unfailing in which conflict tempered silenced reconciled. Benjamin the child of mine old age held hostage into Egypt. O Benjamin. Dilsey said it was because Mother was too proud for him. They come into white people's lives like that in sudden sharp black trickles that isolate white facts for an instant in unarguable truth like under a microscope; the rest of the time just voices that laugh when you see nothing to laugh at, tears when no reason for tears. They will bet on the odd or even number of mourners at a funeral. A brothel full of them in Memphis went into a religious trance ran naked into the street. It took three policemen to subdue one of them. Yes Jesus O good man Jesus O that good man. The car stopped. I got out, with them looking at my eye. When the trolley came it was full. I stopped on the back platform. ""Seats up front,"" the conductor said. I looked into the car. There were no seats on the left side. ""I'm not going far,"" I said. ""I'll just stand here."" We crossed the river. The bridge, that is, arching slow and high into space, between silence and nothingness where lights-- yellow and red and green--trembled in the clear air, repeating themselves. ""Better go up front and get a seat,"" the",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,66,"conductor said. ""I get off pretty soon,"" I said. ""A couple of blocks."" I got off before we reached the postoffice. They'd all be sitting around somewhere by now though, and then I was hearing my watch and I began to listen for the chimes and I touched Shreve's letter through my coat, the bitten shadows of the elms flowing upon my hand. And then as I turned into the quad the chimes did begin and I went on while the notes came up like ripples on a pool and passed me and went on, saying Quarter to what? All right. Quarter to what. Our windows were dark. The entrance was empty. I walked close to the left wall when I entered, but it was empty: just the stairs curving up into shadows echoes of feet in the sad generations like light dust upon the shadows, my feet waking them like dust, lightly to settle again. I could see the letter before I turned the light on, propped against a book on the table so I would see it. Calling him my husband. And then Spoade said they were going somewhere, would not be back until late, and Mrs Bland would need another cavalier. But I would have seen him and he cannot get another car for an hour because after six oclock. I took out my watch and listened to it clicking away, not knowing it couldn't even lie. Then I laid it face up on the table and took Mrs Bland's letter and tore it across and dropped the pieces into the waste basket and took off my coat, vest, collar, tie and shirt. The tie was spoiled too, but then niggers. Maybe a pattern of blood he could call that the one Christ was wearing. I found the gasoline in Shreve's room and spread the vest on the table, where it would be flat, and opened the gasoline. the first car in town a girl Girl that's what Jason couldn't bear smell of gasoline making him sick then got madder than ever because a girl Girl had no sister but Benjamin Benjamin the child of my sorrowful if I'd just had a mother so I could say Mother Mother It took a lot of gasoline, and then I couldn't tell if it was still the stain or just the gasoline. It had started the cut to smarting again so when I went to wash I hung the vest on a chair and lowered the light cord so that the bulb would be drying the splotch. I washed my face and hands, but even then I could smell it within the soap stinging, constricting the nostrils a little. Then I opened the bag and took the shirt and collar and tie out and put the bloody ones in and closed the bag, and dressed. While I was brushing my hair the half hour went. But there was until the three quarters anyway, except suppose seeing on the rushing darkness only his own face no broken feather unless two of them but not two like that going to Boston the same night then my face his face for an instant across the crashing when out of darkness two lighted windows in rigid fleeing Being crash gone his face and mine just I see saw did I see not goodbye the marquee empty of eating the road empty in darkness in silence the bridge arching into silence darkness sleep the water peaceful and swift not goodbye I turned out the light and went into my bedroom, out of the gasoline but I could still smell it. I stood at the window the curtains moved slow out of the darkness touching my face like someone breathing asleep, breathing slow into the darkness again, leaving the touch. After they had gone up stairs Mother lay back in her chair, the camphor handker- chief to her mouth. Father hadn't moved he still sat beside her holding her hand the bellowing hammering away like no place for it in silence When I was little there was a picture in one of our books, a dark place into which a single weak ray of light came slanting upon two faces lifted out of the shadow. You know what I'd do if I were King? she never was a queen or a fairy she was always a king or a giant or a general I'd break that place open and drag them out and I'd whip them good It was torn out, jagged out. I was glad. I'd have to turn back to it until the dungeon was Mother herself she and Father upward into weak light holding hands and us lost somewhere below even them without even a ray of light. Then the honeysuckle got",no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes

As soon as I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep it would begin to come into the room in waves building and building up until I would have to pant to get any air at all out of it until I would have to get up and feel my way like when I was a little boy hands can see touching in the mind shaping unseen door Door now nothing hands can see My nose could see gasoline, the vest on the table, the door. The corridor was still empty of all the feet in sad generations seeking water. yet the eyes unseeing clenched like teeth not disbelieving doubting even the absence of pain shin ankle knee the long invisible flowing of the stair- railing where a misstep in the darkness filled with sleeping Mother Father Caddy Jason Maury door I am not afraid only Mother Father Caddy Jason Maury getting so far ahead sleeping I will sleep fast when I door Door door It was empty too, the pipes, the porcelain, the stained quiet walls, the throne of contemplation. I had forgotten the glass, but I could hands can see cooling fingers invisible swan-throat where less than Moses rod the glass touch tentative not to drumming lean cool throat drumming cooling the metal the glass full overfull cooling the glass the fingers flushing sleep leaving the taste of dampened sleep in the long silence of the throat I returned up the corridor, waking the lost feet in whispering battalions in the silence, into the gasoline, the watch telling its furious lie on the dark table. Then the curtains breathing out of the dark upon my face, leaving the breathing upon my face. A quarter hour yet. And then I'll not be. The peacefullest words. Peacefullest words. Non fui. Sum. Fui. Non sum. Somewhere I heard bells once. Mississippi or Massachusetts. I was. I am not. Massachusetts or Mississippi. Shreve has a bottle in his trunk. Aren't you even going to open it Mr and Mrs Jason Richmond Compson announce the Three times. Days. Aren't you even going to open it marriage of their daughter Candace that liquor teaches you to confuse the means with the end I am. Drink. I was not. Let us sell Benjy's pasture so that Quentin may go to Harvard and I may knock my bones together and together. I will be dead in. Was it one year Caddy said. Shreve has a bottle in his trunk. Sir I will not need Shreve's I have sold Benjy's pasture and I can be dead in Harvard Caddy said in the caverns and the grottoes of the sea tumbling peacefully to the wavering tides because Harvard is such a fine sound forty acres is no high price for a fine sound. A fine dead sound we will swap Benjy's pasture for a fine dead sound. It will last him a long time because he cannot hear it unless he can smell it as soon as she came in the door he began to cry I thought all the time it was just one of those town squirts that Father was always teasing her about until. I didn't notice him any more than any other stranger drummer or what thought they were army shirts until all of a sudden I knew he wasn't thinking of me at all as a Potential source of harm but was thinking of her when he looked at me was looking at me through her like through a Piece of colored glass why must you meddle with me dont you know it wont do any good I thought you'd have left that for Mother and Jason did Mother set Jason to spy on you I wouldn't have. Women only use other people's codes of honor it's because she loves Caddy staying downstairs even when she was sick so Father couldn't kid Uncle Maury before Jason Father said Uncle Maury was too poor a classicist to risk the blind immortal boy in person he should have chosen Jason because Jason would have made only the same kind of blunder Uncle Maury himself would have made not one to get him a black eye the Patterson boy was smaller than Jason too they sold the kites for a nickel a piece until the trouble over finances Jason got a new partner still smaller one small enough anyway because T. P. said Jason still treasurer but Father said why should Uncle Maury work if he Father could support five or six niggers that did nothing at all but sit with their feet in the oven he certainly could board and lodge Uncle Maury now and then and lend him a little money who kept his Father's belief in the celestial",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,68,"derivation of his own species at such a fine heat then Mother would cry and say that Father believed his people were better than hers that he was ridiculing Uncle Maury to teach us the same thing she couldn't see that Father was teaching us that all men are just accumulations dolls stuffed with sawdust swept up from the trash heaps where all previous dolls had been thrown away the sawdust flowing from what wound in what side that not for me died not. It used to be I thought of death as a man something like Grandfather a friend of his a kind of Private and particular friend like we used to think of Grandfather's desk not to touch it not even to talk loud in the room where it was I always thought of them as being together somewhere all the time waiting for old Colonel Sartoris to come down and sit with them waiting on a high place beyond cedar trees Colonel Sartoris was on a still higher place looking out across at something and they were waiting for him to get done looking at it and come down Grandfather wore his uniform and we could hear the murmur of their voices from beyond the cedars they were always talking and Grandfather was always right The three quarters began. The first note sounded, measured and tranquil, serenely peremptory, emptying the unhurried silence for the next one and that's it if people could only change one another forever that way merge like a flame swirling up for an instant then blown cleanly out along the cool eternal dark instead of Iying there trying not to think of the swing until all cedars came to have that vivid dead smell of perfume that Benjy hated so. Just by imagining the clump it seemed to me that I could hear whispers secret surges smell the beating of hot blood under wild unsecret flesh watching against red eyelids the swine untethered in pairs rushing coupled into the sea and he we must just stay awake and see evil done for a little while its not always and i it doesnt have to be even that long for a man of courage and he do you consider that courage and i yes sir dont you and he every man is the arbiter of his own virtues whether or not you consider it courageous is of more importance than the act itself than any act otherwise you could not be in earnest and i you dont believe i am serious and he i think you are too serious to give me any cause for alarm you wouldnt have felt driven to the expedient of telling me you had committed incest otherwise and i i wasnt lying i wasnt lying and he you wanted to sublimate a piece of natural human folly into a horror and then exorcise it with truth and i it was to isolate her out of the loud world so that it would have to flee us of necessity and then the sound of it would be as though it had never been and he did you try to make her do it and i i was afraid to i was afraid she might and then it wouldnt have done any good but if i could tell you we did it would have been so and then the others wouldnt be so and then the world would roar away and he and now this other you are not lying now either but you are still blind to what is in yourself to that part of general truth the sequence of natural events and their causes which shadows every mans brow even benjys you are not thinking of finitude you are contemplating an apotheosis in which a temporary state of mind will become symmetrical above the flesh and aware both of itself and of the flesh it will not quite discard you will not even be dead and i temporary and he you cannot bear to think that someday it will no longer hurt you like this now were getting at it you seem to regard it merely as an experience that will whiten your hair overnight so to speak without altering your appearance at all you wont do it under these conditions it will be a gamble and the strange thing is that man who is conceived by accident and whose every breath is a fresh cast with dice already loaded against him will not face that final main which he knows before hand he has assuredly to face without essaying expedients ranging all the way from violence to petty chicanery that would not deceive a child until someday in very disgust he risks everything on a single blind turn",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes

At last it stopped vibrating and the darkness was still again. I entered the sitting room and turned on the light. I put my vest on. The gasoline was faint now, barely noticeable, and in the mirror the stain didn't show. Not like my eye did, anyway. I put on my coat. Shreve's letter crackled through the cloth and I took it out and examined the address, and put it in my side pocket. Then I carried the watch into Shreve's room and put it in his drawer and went to my room and got a fresh handkerchief and went to the door and put my hand on the light switch. Then I remembered I hadn't brushed my teeth, so I had to open the bag again. I found my toothbrush and got some of Shreve's paste and went out and brushed my teeth. I squeezed the brush as dry as I could and put it back in the bag and shut it, and went to the door again. Before I snapped the light out I looked around to see if there was anything else, then I saw that I had forgotten my hat. I'd have to go by the postoffice and I'd be sure to meet some of them, and they'd think I was a Harvard Square student making like he was a senior. I had forgotten to brush it too, but Shreve had a brush, so I didn't have to open the bag any more. April 6, 1928 Once a bitch always a bitch, what I say. I says you're lucky if her playing out of school is all that worries you. I says she ought to be down there in that kitchen right now, instead of up there in her room, gobbing paint on her face and waiting for six niggers that cant even stand up out of a chair unless they've got a pan full of bread and meat to balance them, to fix breakfast for her. And Mother says, ""But to have the school authorities think that I have no control over her, that I cant--"" ""Well,"" I says. ""You cant, can you? You never have tried to do anything with her,"" I says. ""How do you expect to begin this late, when she's seventeen years old?"" She thought about that for a while. ""But to have them think that ... I didn't even know she had a report card. She told me last fall that they had quit using them this year. And now for Professor Junkin to call me on the telephone and tell me if she's absent one more time, she will have to leave school. How does she do it? Where does she go? You're down town all day; you ought to see her if she stays on the streets."" ""Yes,"" I says. ""If she stayed on the streets. I dont reckon she'd be playing out of school just to do something she could do in public,"" I says. ""What do you mean?"" she says. ""I dont mean anything,"" I says. ""I just answered your question."" Then she begun to cry",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,70,"again, talking about how her own flesh and blood rose up to curse her. ""You asked me,"" I says. ""I dont mean you,"" she says. ""You are the only one of them that isn't a reproach to me."" ""Sure,"" I says. ""I never had time to be. I never had time to go to Harvard or drink myself into the ground. I had to work. But of course if you want me to follow her around and see what she does, I can quit the store and get a job where I can work at night. Then I can watch her during the day and you can use Ben for the night shift."" ""I know I'm just a trouble and a burden to you,"" she says, crying on the pillow. ""I ought to know it,"" I says. ""You've been telling me that for thirty years. Even Ben ought to know it now. Do you want me to say anything to her about it?"" ""Do you think it will do any good?"" she says. ""Not if you come down there interfering just when I get started,"" I says. ""If you want me to control her, just say so and keep your hands off. Everytime I try to, you come butting in and then she gives both of us the laugh."" ""Remember she's your own flesh and blood,"" she says. ""Sure,"" I says, ""that's just what I'm thinking of--flesh. And a little blood too, if I had my way. When people act like niggers, no matter who they are the only thing to do is treat them like a nigger."" ""I'm afraid you'll lose your temper with her,"" she says. ""Well,"" I says. ""You haven't had much luck with your system. You want me to do anything about it, or not? Say one way or the other; I've got to get on to work."" ""I know you have to slave your life away for us,"" she says. ""You know if I had my way, you'd have an office of your own to go to, and hours that became a Bascomb. Because you are a Bascomb, despite your name. I know that if your father could have foreseen--"" ""Well,"" I says, ""I reckon he's entitled to guess wrong now and then, like anybody else, even a Smith or a Jones."" She begun to cry again. ""To hear you speak bitterly of your dead father,"" she says. ""All right,"" I says, ""all right. Have it your way. But as I haven't got an office, I'll have to get on to what I have got. Do you want me to say anything to her?"" ""I'm afraid you'll lose your temper with her,"" she says. ""All right,"" I says. ""I wont say anything, then."" ""But something must be done,"" she says. ""To have people think I permit her to stay out of school and run about the streets, or that I cant prevent her doing it.... Jason, Jason,"" she says. ""How could you. How could you leave me with these burdens."" ""Now, now,"" I says. ""You'll make yourself sick. Why dont you either lock her up all day too, or turn her over to me and quit worrying over her?"" ""My own flesh and blood,"" she says, crying. So I says, ""All right. I'll tend to her. Quit crying, now."" ""Dont lose your temper,"" she says. ""She's just a child, remember."" ""No,"" I says. ""I wont."" I went out, closing the door. ""Jason,"" she says. I didn't answer. I went down the hall. ""Jason,"" she says beyond the door. I went on down stairs. There wasn't anybody in the diningroom, then I heard her in the kitchen. She was trying to make Dilsey let her have another cup of coffee. I went in. ""I reckon that's your school costume, is it?"" I says. ""Or maybe today's a holiday?"" ""Just a half a cup, Dilsey,"" she says. ""Please."" ""No, suh,"" Dilsey says. ""I aint gwine do it. You aint got no business wid mo'n one cup, a seventeen year old gal, let lone whut Miss Cahline say. You go on and git dressed for school, so you kin ride to town wid Jason. You fixin to be late again."" ""No she's not,"" I says. ""We're going to fix that right now."" She looked at me, the cup in her hand. She brushed her hair back from her face, her kimono slipping off her shoulder. ""You put that cup down and come in here a minute,"" I says. ""What for?"" she says. ""Come on,"" I says. ""Put that cup in the sink and come in here."" ""What you up to now, Jason?"" Dilsey says. ""You may think you can run over me like you do your grandmother and everybody else,"" I says. ""But you'll find out different. I'll",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,71,"give you ten seconds to put that cup down like I told you."" She quit looking at me. She looked at Dilsey. ""What time is it, Dilsey?"" she says. ""When it's ten seconds, you whistle. Just a half a cup. Dilsey, pl--"" I grabbed her by the arm. She dropped the cup. It broke on the floor and she jerked back, looking at me, but I held her arm. Dilsey got up from her chair. ""You, Jason,"" she says. ""You turn me loose,"" Quentin says. ""I'll slap you."" ""You will, will you?"" I says. ""You will will you?"" She slapped at me. I caught that hand too and held her like a wildcat. ""You will, will you?"" I says. ""You think you will?"" ""You, Jason!"" Dilsey says. I dragged her into the diningroom. Her kimono came unfastened, flapping about her, dam near naked. Dilsey came hobbling along. I turned and kicked the door shut in her face. ""You keep out of here,"" I says. Quentin was leaning against the table, fastening her kimono. I looked at her. ""Now,"" I says. ""I want to know what you mean, playing out of school and telling your grandmother lies and forging her name on your report and worrying her sick. What do you mean by it?"" She didn't say anything. She was fastening her kimono up under her chin, pulling it tight around her, looking at me. She hadn't got around to painting herself yet and her face looked like she had polished it with a gun rag. I went and grabbed her wrist. ""What do you mean?"" I says. ""None of your damn business,"" she says. ""You turn me loose."" Dilsey came in the door. ""You, Jason,"" she says. ""You get out of here, like I told you,"" I says, not even looking back. ""I want to know where you go when you play out of school,"" I says. ""You keep off the streets, or I'd see you. Who do you play out with? Are you hiding out in the woods with one of those dam slick-headed jellybeans? Is that where you go?"" ""You--you old goddam!"" she says. She fought, but I held her. ""You damn old goddam!"" she says. ""I'll show you,"" I says. ""You may can scare an old woman off, but I'll show you who's got hold of you now."" I held her with one hand, then she quit fighting and watched me, her eyes getting wide and black. ""What are you going to do?"" she says. ""You wait until I get this belt out and I'll show you,"" I says, pulling my belt out. Then Dilsey grabbed my arm. ""Jason,"" she says. ""You, Jason! Aint you shamed of yourself."" ""Dilsey,"" Quentin says. ""Dilsey."" ""I aint gwine let him,"" Dilsey says. ""Dont you worry, honey."" She held to my arm. Then the belt came out and I jerked loose and flung her away. She stumbled into the table. She was so old she couldn't do any more than move hardly. But that's all right: we need somebody in the kitchen to eat up the grub the young ones cant tote off. She came hobbling between us, trying to hold me again. ""Hit me, den,"" she says, ""ef nothin else but hittin somebody wont do you. Hit me,"" she says. ""You think I wont?"" I says. ""I dont put no devilment beyond you,"" she says. Then I heard Mother on the stairs. I might have known she wasn't going to keep out of it. I let go. She stumbled back against the wall, holding her kimono shut. ""All right,"" I says. ""We'll just put this off a while. But dont think you can run it over me. I'm not an old woman, nor an old half dead nigger, either. You dam little slut,"" I says. ""Dilsey,"" she says. ""Dilsey, I want my mother."" Dilsey went to her. ""Now, now,"" she says. ""He aint gwine so much as lay his hand on you while Ise here."" Mother came on down the stairs. ""Jason,"" she says. ""Dilsey."" ""Now, now,"" Dilsey says. ""I aint gwine let him tech you."" She put her hand on Quentin. She knocked it down. ""You damn old nigger,"" she says. She ran toward the door. ""Dilsey,"" Mother says on the stairs. Quentin ran up the stairs, passing her. ""Quentin,"" Mother says. ""You, Quentin."" Quentin ran on. I could hear her when she reached the top, then in the hall. Then the door slammed. Mother had stopped. Then she came on. ""Dilsey,"" she says. ""All right,"" Dilsey says. ""Ise comin. You go on and git dat car and wait now,"" she says, ""so you kin cahy her to school."" ""dont you worry,"" I says. ""I'll take her to school and I'm going to see that she stays there. I've",no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,72,"started this thing, and I'm going through with it."" ""Jason,"" Mother says on the stairs. ""Go on, now,"" Dilsey says, going toward the door. ""You want to git her started too? Ise comin, Miss Cahline."" I went on out. I could hear them on the steps. ""You go on back to bed now,"" Dilsey was saying. ""dont you know you aint feeling well enough to git up yet? Go on back, now. I'm gwine to see she gits to school in time."" I went on out the back to back the car out, then I had to go all the way round to the front before I found them. ""I thought I told you to put that tire on the back of the car,"" I says. ""I aint had time,"" Luster says. ""Aint nobody to watch him till mammy git done in de kitchen."" ""Yes,"" I says. ""I feed a whole dam kitchen full of niggers to follow around after him, but if I want an automobile tire changed, I have to do it myself."" ""I aint had nobody to leave him wid,"" he says. Then he begun moaning and slobbering. ""Take him on round to the back,"" I says. ""What the hell makes you want to keep him around here where people can see him?"" I made them go on, before he got started bellowing good. It's bad enough on Sundays, with that dam field full of people that haven't got a side show and six niggers to feed, knocking a dam oversize mothball around. He's going to keep on running up and down that fence and bellowing every time they come in sight until first thing I know they're going to begin charging me golf dues, then Mother and Dilsey'll have to get a couple of china door knobs and a walking stick and work it out, unless I play at night with a lantern. Then they'd send us all to Jackson, maybe. God knows, they'd hold Old Home week when that happened. I went on back to the garage. There was the tire, leaning against the wall, but be damned if I was going to put it on. I backed out and turned around. She was standing by the drive. I says, ""I know you haven't got any books: I just want to ask you what you did with them, if it's any of my business. Of course I haven't got any right to ask,"" I says. ""I'm just the one that paid $11.65 for them last September."" ""Mother buys my books,"" she says. ""There's not a cent of your money on me. I'd starve first."" ""Yes?"" I says. ""You tell your grandmother that and see what she says. You dont look all the way naked,"" I says, ""even if that stuff on your face does hide more of you than anything else you've got on."" ""Do you think your money or hers either paid for a cent of this?"" she says. ""Ask your grandmother,"" I says. ""Ask her what became of those checks. You saw her burn one of them, as I remember."" She wasn't even listening, with her face all gummed up with paint and her eyes hard as a fice dog's. ""Do you know what I'd do if I thought your money or hers either bought one cent of this?"" she says, putting her hand on her dress. ""What would you do?"" I says. ""Wear a barrel?"" ""I'd tear it right off and throw it into the street,"" she says. ""dont you believe me?"" ""Sure you would,"" I says. ""You do it every time."" ""See if I wouldn't,"" she says. She grabbed the neck of her dress in both hands and made like she would tear it. ""You tear that dress,"" I says, ""and I'll give you a whipping right here that you'll remember all your life."" ""See if I dont,"" she says. Then I saw that she really was trying to tear it, to tear it right off of her. By the time I got the car stopped and grabbed her hands there was about a dozen people looking. It made me so mad for a minute it kind of blinded me. ""You do a thing like that again and I'll make you sorry you ever drew breath,"" I says. ""I'm sorry now,"" she says. She quit, then her eyes turned kind of funny and I says to myself if you cry here in this car, on the street, I'll whip you. I'll wear you out. Lucky for her she didn't, so I turned her wrists loose and drove on. Luckily we were near an alley, where I could turn into the back street and dodge the square. They were already putting the tent up in Beard's lot. Earl had already given me",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,73,"the two passes for our show windows. She sat there with her face turned away, chewing her lip. ""I'm sorry now,"" she says. ""I dont see why I was ever born."" ""And I know of at least one other person that dont understand all he knows about that,"" I says. I stopped in front of the school house. The bell had rung, and the last of them were just going in. ""You're on time for once, anyway,"" I says. ""Are you going in there and stay there, or am I coming with you and make you?"" She got out and banged the door. ""Remember what I say,"" I says. ""I mean it. Let me hear one more time that you are slipping up and down back alleys with one of those dam squirts."" She turned back at that. ""I dont slip around,"" she says. ""I dare anybody to know everything I do."" ""And they all know it, too,"" I says. ""Everybody in this town knows what you are. But I wont have it anymore, you hear? I dont care what you do, myself,"" I says. ""But I've got a position in this town, and I'm not going to have any member of my family going on like a nigger wench. You hear me?"" ""I dont care,"" she says. ""I'm bad and I'm going to hell, and I dont care. I'd rather be in hell than anywhere where you are."" ""If I hear one more time that you haven't been to school, you'll wish you were in hell,"" I says. She turned and ran on across the yard. ""One more time, remember,"" I says. She didn't look back. I went to the postoffice and got the mail and drove on to the store and parked. Earl looked at me when I came in. I gave him a chance to say something about my being late, but he just said, ""Those cultivators have come. You'd better help Uncle Job put them up."" I went on to the back, where old Job was uncrating them, at the rate of about three bolts to the hour. ""You ought to be working for me,"" I says. ""Every other no-count nigger in town eats in my kitchen."" ""I works to suit de man whut pays me Sat'dy night,"" he says. ""When I does cat, it dont leave me a whole lot of time to please other folks."" He screwed up a nut. ""Aint nobody works much in dis country cep de boll- weevil, noways,"" he says. ""You'd better be glad you're not a boll-weevil waiting on those cultivators,"" I says. ""You'd work yourself to death before they'd be ready to prevent you."" ""Dat's de troof,"" he says. ""Boll-weevil got tough time. Work ev'y day in de week out in de hot sun, rain er shine. Aint got no front porch to set on en watch de wattermilyuns growin and Sat'dy dont mean nothin a-tall to him."" ""Saturday wouldn't mean nothing to you, either,"" I says, ""if it depended on me to pay you wages. Get those things out of the crates now and drag them inside."" I opened her letter first and took the check out. Just like a woman. Six days late. Yet they try to make men believe that they're capable of conducting a business. How long would a man that thought the first of the month came on the sixth last in business. And like as not, when they sent the bank statement out, she would want to know why I never deposited my salary until the sixth. Things like that never occur to a woman. ""I had no answer to my letter about Quentin's easter dress. Did it arrive all right? I've had no answer to the last two letters I wrote her, though the check in the second one was cashed with the other check. Is she sick? Let me know at once or I'll come there and see for myself. You promised you would let me know when she needed things. I will expect to hear from you before the 10th. No you'd better wire me at once. You are opening my letters to her. I know that as well as if I were looking at you. You'd better wire me at once about her to this address."" About that time Earl started yelling at Job, so I put them away and went over to try to put some life into him. What this country needs is white labor. Let these dam trifling niggers starve for a couple of years, then they'd see what a soft thing they have. Along toward ten oclock I went up front. There was a drummer there. It was a couple of minutes to ten, and I invited him up the street to get a",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,74,"dope. We got to talking about crops. ""There's nothing to it,"" I says. ""Cotton is a speculator's crop. They fill the farmer full of hot air and get him to raise a big crop for them to whipsaw on the market, to trim the suckers with. Do you think the farmer gets anything out of it except a red neck and a hump in his back? You think the man that sweats to put it into the ground gets a red cent more than a bare living,"" I says. ""Let him make a big crop and it wont be worth picking; let him make a small crop and he wont have enough to gin. And what for? so a bunch of dam eastern jews I'm not talking about men of the jewish religion,"" I says. ""I've known some jews that were fine citizens. You might be one yourself,"" I says. ""No,"" he says. ""I'm an American."" ""No offense,"" I says. ""I give every man his due, regardless of religion or anything else. I have nothing against jews as an individual,"" I says. ""It's just the race. You'll admit that they produce nothing. They follow the pioneers into a new country and sell them clothes."" ""You're thinking of Armenians,"" he says, ""aren't you. A pioneer wouldn't have any use for new clothes."" ""No offense,"" I says. ""I dont hold a man's religion against him."" ""Sure,"" he says. ""I'm an American. My folks have some French blood, why I have a nose like this. I'm an American, all right."" ""So am I,"" I says. ""Not many of us left. What I'm talking about is the fellows that sit up there in New York and trim the sucker gamblers."" ""That's right,"" he says. ""Nothing to gambling, for a poor man. There ought to be a law against it."" ""dont you think I'm right?"" I says. ""Yes,"" he says. ""I guess you're right. The farmer catches it coming and going."" ""I know I'm right,"" I says. ""It's a sucker game, unless a man gets inside information from somebody that knows what's going on. I happen to be associated with some people who're right there on the ground. They have one of the biggest manipulators in New York for an adviser. Way I do it,"" I says, ""I never risk much at a time. It's the fellow that thinks he knows it all and is trying to make a killing with three dollars that they're laying for. That's why they are in the business."" Then it struck ten. I went up to the telegraph office. It opened up a little, just like they said. I went into the corner and took out the telegram again, just to be sure. While I was looking at it a report came in. It was up two points. They were all buying. I could tell that from what they were saying. Getting aboard. Like they didn't know it could go but one way. Like there was a law or something against doing anything but buying. Well, I reckon those eastern jews have got to live too. But I'll be damned if it hasn't come to a pretty pass when any dam foreigner that cant make a living in the country where God put him, can come to this one and take money right out of an American's pockets. It was up two points more. Four points. But hell, they were right there and knew what was going on. And if I wasn't going to take the advice, what was I paying them ten dollars a month for. I went out, then I remembered and came back and sent the wire. ""All well. Q writing today."" ""Q?"" the operator says. ""Yes,"" I says. ""Q. Cant you spell Q?"" ""I just asked to be sure,"" he says. ""You send it like I wrote it and I'll guarantee you to be sure,"" I says. ""Send it collect."" ""What you sending, Jason?"" Doc Wright says, looking over my shoulder. ""Is that a code message to buy?"" ""That's all right about that,"" I says. ""You boys use your own judgment. You know more about it than those New York folks do."" ""Well, I ought to,"" Doc says. ""I'd a saved money this year raising it at two cents a pound."" Another report came in. It was down a point. ""Jason's selling,"" Hopkins says. ""Look at his face."" ""That's all right about what I'm doing,"" I says. ""You boys follow your own judgment. Those rich New York jews have got to live like everybody else,"" I says. I went on back to the store. Earl was busy up front. I went on back to the desk and read Lorraine's letter. ""Dear daddy wish you were here. No good parties when daddys out of town I",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,75,"miss my sweet daddy."" I reckon she does. Last time I gave her forty dollars. Gave it to her. I never promise a woman anything nor let her know what I'm going to give her. That's the only way to manage them. Always keep them guessing. If you cant think of any other way to surprise them, give them a bust in the jaw. I tore it up and burned it over the spittoon. I make it a rule never to keep a scrap of paper bearing a woman's hand, and I never write them at all. Lorraine is always after me to write to her but I says anything I forgot to tell you will save till I get to Memphis again but I says I dont mind you writing me now and then in a plain envelope, but if you ever try to call me up on the telephone, Memphis wont hold you I says. I says when I'm up there I'm one of the boys, but I'm not going to have any woman calling me on the telephone. Here I says, giving her the forty dollars. If you ever get drunk and take a notion to call me on the phone, just remember this and count ten before you do it. ""When'll that be?"" she says. ""What?"" I says. ""When you're coming back,"" she says. ""I'll let you know,"" I says. Then she tried to buy a beer, but I wouldn't let her. ""Keep your money,"" I says. ""Buy yourself a dress with it."" I gave the maid a five, too. After all, like I say money has no value; it's just the way you spend it. It dont belong to anybody, so why try to hoard it. It just belongs to the man that can get it and keep it. There's a man right here in Jefferson made a lot of money selling rotten goods to niggers, lived in a room over the store about the size of a pigpen, and did his own cooking. About four or five years ago he was taken sick. Scared the hell out of him so that when he was up again he joined the church and bought himself a Chinese missionary, five thousand dollars a year. I often think how mad he'll be if he was to die and find out there's not any heaven, when he thinks about that five thousand a year. Like I say, he'd better go on and die now and save money. When it was burned good I was just about to shove the others into my coat when all of a sudden something told me to open Quentin's before I went home, but about that time Earl started yelling for me up front, so I put them away and went and waited on the dam redneck while he spent fifteen minutes deciding whether he wanted a twenty cent hame string or a thirty-five cent one. ""You'd better take that good one,"" I says. ""How do you fellows ever expect to get ahead, trying to work with cheap equipment?"" ""If this one aint any good,"" he says, ""why have you got it on sale?"" ""I didn't say it wasn't any good,"" I says. ""I said it's not as good as that other one."" ""How do you know it's not,"" he says. ""You ever use airy one of them?"" ""Because they dont ask thirty-five cents for it,"" I says. ""That's how I know it's not as good."" He held the twenty cent one in his hands, drawing it through his fingers. ""I reckon I'll take this hyer one,"" he says. I offered to take it and wrap it, but he rolled it up and put it in his overalls. Then he took out a tobacco sack and finally got it untied and shook some coins out. He handed me a quarter. ""That fifteen cents will buy me a snack of dinner,"" he says. ""All right,"" I says. ""You're the doctor. But dont come complaining to me next year when you have to buy a new outfit."" ""I aint makin next year's crop yit,"" he says. Finally I got rid of him, but every time I took that letter out something would come up. They were all in town for the show, coming in in droves to give their money to something that brought nothing to the town and wouldn't leave anything except what those grafters in the Mayor's office will split among themselves, and Earl chasing back and forth like a hen in a coop, saying ""Yes, ma'am, Mr Compson will wait on you. Jason, show this lady a churn or a nickel's worth of screen hooks."" Well, Jason likes work. I says no I never had university advantages because at Harvard they teach you",no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,76,"how to go for a swim at night without knowing how to swim and at Sewanee they dont even teach you what water is. I says you might send me to the state University; maybe I'll learn how to stop my clock with a nose spray and then you can send Ben to the Navy I says or to the cavalry anyway, they use geldings in the cavalry. Then when she sent Quentin home for me to feed too I says I guess that's right too, instead of me having to go way up north for a job they sent the job down here to me and then Mother begun to cry and I says it's not that I have any objection to having it here; if it's any satisfaction to you I'll quit work and nurse it myself and let you and Dilsey keep the flour barrel full, or Ben. Rent him out to a sideshow; there must be folks somewhere that would pay a dime to see him, then she cried more and kept saying my poor afflicted baby and I says yes he'll be quite a help to you when he gets his growth not being more than one and a half times as high as me now and she says she'd be dead soon and then we'd all be better off and so I says all right, all right, have it your way. It's your grandchild, which is more than any other grandparents it's got can say for certain. Only I says it's only a question of time. If you believe she'll do what she says and not try to see it, you fool yourself because the first time that was the Mother kept on saying thank God you are not a Compson except in name, because you are all I have left now, you and Maury and I says well I could spare Uncle Maury myself and then they came and said they were ready to start. Mother stopped crying then. She pulled her veil down and we went down stairs. Uncle Maury was coming out of the diningroom, his handkerchief to his mouth. They kind of made a lane and we went out the door just in time to see Dilsey driving Ben and T. P. back around the corner. We went down the steps and got in. Uncle Maury kept saying Poor little sister, poor little sister, talking around his mouth and patting Mother's hand. Talking around whatever it was. ""Have you got your band on?"" she says. ""Why dont they go on, before Benjamin comes out and makes a spectacle. Poor little boy. He doesn't know. He cant even realise."" ""There, there,"" Uncle Maury says, patting her hand, talking around his mouth. ""It's better so. Let him be unaware of bereavement until he has to."" ""Other women have their children to support them in times like this,"" Mother says. ""You have Jason and me,"" he says. ""It's so terrible to me,"" she says. ""Having the two of them like this, in less than two years."" ""There, there,"" he says. After a while he kind of sneaked his hand to his mouth and dropped them out the window. Then I knew what I had been smelling. Clove stems. I reckon he thought that the least he could do at Father's or maybe the sideboard thought it was still Father and tripped him up when he passed. Like I say, if he had to sell something to send Quentin to Harvard we'd all been a dam sight better off if he'd sold that sideboard and bought himself a one-armed strait jacket with part of the money. I reckon the reason all the Compson gave out before it got to me like Mother says, is that he drank it up. At least I never heard of him offering to sell anything to send me to Harvard. So he kept on patting her hand and saying ""Poor little sister"", patting her hand with one of the black gloves that we got the bill for four days later because it was the twenty-sixth because it was the same day one month that Father went up there and got it and brought it home and wouldn't tell anything about where she was or anything and Mother crying and saying ""And you didn't even see him? You didn't even try to get him to make any provision for it?"" and Father says ""No she shall not touch his money not one cent of it"" and Mother says ""He can be forced to by law. He can prove nothing, unless--Jason Compson,"" she says. ""Were you fool enough to tell-- "" ""Hush, Caroline,"" Father says, then he sent me to help Dilsey get that old cradle out of the attic and",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,77,"I says, ""Well, they brought my job home tonight"" because all the time we kept hoping they'd get things straightened out and he'dfool keep her because Mother kept saying she would at least have enough regard for the family not to jeopardise my chance after she and Quentin had had theirs. ""And whar else do she belong?"" Dilsey says. ""Who else gwine raise her cep me? Aint I raised ev'y one of y'all?"" ""And a dam fine job you made of it,"" I says. ""Anyway it'll give her something to sure enough worry over now."" So we carried the cradle down and Dilsey started to set it up in her old room. Then Mother started sure enough. ""Hush, Miss Cahline,"" Dilsey says. ""You gwine wake her up."" ""In there?"" Mother says. ""To be contaminated by that atmosphere? It'll be hard enough as it is, with the heritage she already has."" ""Hush,"" Father says. ""dont be silly."" ""Why aint she gwine sleep in here,"" Dilsey says. ""In the same room whar I put her maw to bed ev'y night of her life since she was big enough to sleep by herself."" ""You dont know,"" Mother says. ""To have my own daughter cast off by her husband. Poor little innocent baby,"" she says, looking at Quentin. ""You will never know the suffering you've caused."" ""Hush, Caroline,"" Father says. ""What you want to go on like that fo Jason fer?"" Dilsey says. ""I've tried to protect him,"" Mother says. ""I've always tried to protect him from it. At least I can do my best to shield her."" ""How sleepin in dis room gwine hurt her, I like to know,"" Dilsey says. ""I cant help it,"" Mother says. ""I know I'm just a troublesome old woman. But I know that people cannot flout God's laws with impunity."" ""Nonsense,"" Father says. ""Fix it in Miss Caroline's room then, Dilsey."" ""You can say nonsense,"" Mother says. ""But she must never know. She must never even learn that name. Dilsey, I forbid you ever to speak that name in her hearing. If she could grow up never to know that she had a mother, I would thank God."" ""dont be a fool,"" Father says. ""I have never interfered with the way you brought them up,"" Mother says. ""But now I cannot stand anymore. We must decide this now, tonight. Either that name is never to be spoken in her hearing, or she must go, or I will go. Take your choice."" ""Hush,"" Father says. ""You're just upset. Fix it in here, Dilsey."" ""En you's about sick too,"" Dilsey says. ""You looks like a hant. You git in bed and I'll fix you a toddy and see kin you sleep. I bet you aint had a full night's sleep since you lef."" ""No,"" Mother says. ""dont you know what the doctor says? Why must you encourage him to drink? That's what's the matter with him now. Look at me, I suffer too, but I'm not so weak that I must kill myself with whiskey."" ""Fiddlesticks,"" Father says. ""What do doctors know? They make their livings advising people to do whatever they are not doing at the time, which is the extent of anyone's knowledge of the degenerate ape. You'll have a minister in to hold my hand next."" Then Mother cried, and he went out. Went down stairs, and then I heard the sideboard. I woke up and heard him going down again. Mother had gone to sleep or something, because the house was quiet at last. He was trying to be quiet too, because I couldn't hear him, only the bottom of his nightshirt and his bare legs in front of the sideboard. Dilsey fixed the cradle and undressed her and put her in it. She never had waked up since he brought her in the house. ""She pretty near too big fer hit,"" Dilsey says. ""Dar now. I gwine spread me a pallet right across de hall, so you wont need to git up in de night."" ""I wont sleep,"" Mother says. ""You go on home. I wont mind. I'll be happy to give the rest of my life to her, if I can just prevent--"" ""Hush, now,"" Dilsey says. ""We gwine take keer of her. En you go on to bed too,"" she says to me. ""You got to go to school tomorrow."" So I went out, then Mother called me back and cried on me a while. ""You are my only hope,"" she says. ""Every night I thank God for you."" While we were waiting there for them to start she says Thank God if he had to be taken too, it is you left me and not Quentin. Thank God you are not a Compson, because all I have left now is you",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,78,"and Maury and I says, Well I could spare Uncle Maury myself. Well, he kept on patting her hand with his black glove, talking away from her. He took them off when his turn with the shovel came. He got up near the first, where they were holding the umbrellas over them, stamping every now and then and trying to kick the mud off their feet and sticking to the shovels so they'd have to knock it off, making a hollow sound when it fell on it, and when I stepped back around the hack I could see him behind a tombstone, taking another one out of a bottle. I thought he never was going to stop because I had on my new suit too, but it happened that there wasn't much mud on the wheels yet, only Mother saw it and says I dont know when you'll ever have another one and Uncle Maury says, ""Now, now. Dont you worry at all. You have me to depend on, always."" And we have. Always. The fourth letter was from him. But there wasn't any need to open it. I could have written it myself, or recited it to her from memory, adding ten dollars just to be safe. But I had a hunch about that other letter. I just felt that it was about time she was up to some of her tricks again. She got pretty wise after that first time. She found out pretty quick that I was a different breed of cat from Father. When they begun to get it filled up toward the top Mother started crying sure enough, so Uncle Maury got in with her and drove off. He says You can come in with somebody; they'll be glad to give you a lift. I'll have to take your mother on and I thought about saying, Yes you ought to brought two bottles instead of just one only I thought about where we were, so I let them go on. Little they cared how wet I got, because then Mother could have a whale of a time being afraid I was taking pneumonia. Well, I got to thinking about that and watching them throwing dirt into it, slapping it on anyway like they were making mortar or something or building a fence, and I began to feel sort of funny and so I decided to walk around a while. I thought that if I went toward town they'd catch up and be trying to make me get in one of them, so I went on back toward the nigger graveyard. I got under some cedars, where the rain didn't come much, only dripping now and then, where I could see when they got through and went away. After a while they were all gone and I waited a minute and came out. I had to follow the path to keep out of the wet grass so I didn't see her until I was pretty near there, standing there in a black cloak, looking at the flowers. I knew who it was right off, before she turned and looked at me and lifted up her veil. ""Hello, Jason,"" she says, holding out her hand. We shook hands. ""What are you doing here?"" I says. ""I thought you promised her you wouldn't come back here. I thought you had more sense than that."" ""Yes?"" she says. She looked at the flowers again. There must have been fifty dollars' worth. Somebody had put one bunch on Quentin's. ""You did?"" she says. ""I'm not surprised though,"" I says. ""I wouldn't put anything past you. You dont mind anybody. You dont give a dam about anybody."" ""Oh,"" she says, ""that job."" She looked at the grave. ""I'm sorry about that, Jason."" ""I bet you are,"" I says. ""You'll talk mighty meek now. But you needn't have come back. There's not anything left. Ask Uncle Maury, if you dont believe me."" ""I dont want anything,"" she says. She looked at the grave. ""Why didn't they let me know?"" she says. ""I just happened to see it in the paper. On the back page. Just happened to."" I didn't say anything. We stood there, looking at the grave, and then I got to thinking about when we were little and one thing and another and I got to feeling funny again, kind of mad or something, thinking about now we'd have Uncle Maury around the house all the time, running things like the way he left me to come home in the rain by myself. I says, ""A fine lot you care, sneaking in here soon as he's dead. But it wont do you any good. Dont think that you can take advantage of this to come sneaking back. If you cant",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,79,"stay on the horse you've got, you'll have to walk,"" I says. ""We dont even know your name at that house,"" I says. ""Do you know that? We dont even know your name. You'd be better off if you were down there with him and Quentin,"" I says. ""Do you know that?"" ""I know it,"" she says. ""Jason,"" she says, looking at the grave, ""if you'll fix it so I can see her a minute I'll give you fifty dollars."" ""You haven't got fifty dollars,"" I says. ""Will you?"" she says, not looking at me. ""Let's see it,"" I says. ""I dont believe you've got fifty dollars."" I could see where her hands were moving under her cloak, then she held her hand out. Dam if it wasn't full of money. I could see two or three yellow ones. ""Does he still give you money?"" I says. ""How much does he send you?"" ""I'll give you a hundred,"" she says. ""Will you?"" ""Just a minute,"" I says. ""And just like I say. I wouldn't have her know it for a thousand dollars "" ""Yes,"" she says. ""Just like you say do it. Just so I see her a minute. I wont beg or do anything. I'll go right on away."" ""Give me the money,"" I says. ""I'll give it to you afterward,"" she says. ""dont you trust me?"" I says. ""No,"" she says. ""I know you. I grew up with you."" ""You're a fine one to talk about trusting people,"" I says. ""Well,"" I says. ""I got to get on out of the rain. Goodbye."" I made to go away. ""Jason,"" she says. I stopped. ""Yes?"" I says. ""Hurry up. I'm getting wet."" ""All right,"" she says. ""Here."" There wasn't anybody in sight. I went back and took the money. She still held to it. ""You'll do it?"" she says, looking at me from under the veil. ""You promise?"" ""Let go,"" I says. ""You want somebody to come along and see us?"" She let go. I put the money in my pocket. ""You'll do it, Jason?"" she says. ""I wouldn't ask you, if there was any other way."" ""You dam right there's no other way,"" I says. ""Sure I'll do it. I said I would, didn't I? Only you'll have to do just like I say, now."" ""Yes,"" she says. ""I will."" So I told her where to be, and went to the livery stable. I hurried and got there just as they were unhitching the hack. I asked if they had paid for it yet and he said No and I said Mrs Compson forgot something and wanted it again, so they let me take it. Mink was driving. I bought him a cigar, so we drove around until it begun to get dark on the back streets where they wouldn't see him. Then Mink said he'd have to take the team on back and so I said I'd buy him another cigar and so we drove into the lane and I went across the yard to the house. I stopped in the hall until I could hear Mother and Uncle Maury upstairs, then I went on back to the kitchen. She and Ben were there with Dilsey. I said Mother wanted her and I took her into the house. I found Uncle Maury's raincoat and put it around her and picked her up and went back to the lane and got in the hack. I told Mink to drive to the depot. He was afraid to pass the stable, so we had to go the back way and I saw her standing on the corner under the light and I told Mink to drive close to the walk and when I said Go on, to give the team a bat. Then I took the raincoat off of her and held her to the window and Caddy saw her and sort of jumped forward. ""Hit 'em, Mink!"" I says, and Mink gave them a cut and we went past her like a fire engine. ""Now get on that train like you promised,"" I says. I could see her running after us through the back window. ""Hit 'em again,"" I says. ""Let's get on home."" When we turned the corner she was still running. And so I counted the money again that night and put it away, and I didn't feel so bad. I says I reckon that'll show you. I reckon you'll know now that you cant beat me out of a job and get away with it. It never occurred to me she wouldn't keep her promise and take that train. But I didn't know much about them then; I didn't have any more sense than to believe what they said, because the next morning dam if she",no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,80,"didn't walk right into the store, only she had sense enough to wear the veil and not speak to anybody. It was Saturday morning, because I was at the store, and she came right on back to the desk where I was, walking fast. ""Liar,"" she says. ""Liar."" ""Are you crazy?"" I says. ""What do you mean? coming in here like this?"" She started in, but I shut her off. I says, ""You already cost me one job; do you want me to lose this one too? If you've got anything to say to me, I'll meet you somewhere after dark. What have you got to say to me?"" I says. ""Didn't I do everything I said? I said see her a minute, didn't I? Well, didn't you?"" She just stood there looking at me, shaking like an ague-fit, her hands clenched and kind of jerking. ""I did just what I said I would,"" I says. ""You're the one that lied. You promised to take that train. Didn't you? Didn't you promise? If you think you can get that money back, just try it,"" I says. ""If it'd been a thousand dollars, you'd still owe me after the risk I took. And if I see or hear you're still in town after number 17 runs,"" I says, ""I'll tell Mother and Uncle Maury. Then hold your breath until you see her again."" She just stood there, looking at me, twisting her hands together. ""Damn you,"" she says. ""Damn you."" ""Sure,"" I says. ""That's all right too. Mind what I say, now. After number 17, and I tell them."" After she was gone I felt better. I says I reckon you'll think twice before you deprive me of a job that was promised me. I was a kid then. I believed folks when they said they'd do things. I've learned better since. Besides, like I say I guess I dont need any man's help to get along I can stand on my own feet like I always have. Then all of a sudden I thought of Dilsey and Uncle Maury. I thought how she'd get around Dilsey and that Uncle Maury would do anything for ten dollars. And there I was, couldn't even get away from the store to protect my own Mother. Like she says, if one of you had to be taken, thank God it was you left me I can depend on you and I says well I dont reckon I'll ever get far enough from the store to get out of your reach. Somebody's got to hold on to what little we have left, I reckon. So as soon as I got home I fixed Dilsey. I told Dilsey she had leprosy and I got the bible and read where a man's flesh rotted off and I told her that if she ever looked at her or Ben or Quentin they'd catch it too. So I thought I had everything all fixed until that day when I came home and found Ben bellowing. Raising hell and nobody could quiet him. Mother said, Well, get him the slipper then. Dilsey made out she didn't hear. Mother said it again and I says I'd go I couldn't stand that dam noise. Like I say I can stand lots of things I dont expect much from them but if I have to work all day long in a dam store dam if I dont think I deserve a little peace and quiet to eat dinner in. So I says I'd go and Dilsey says quick, ""Jason!"" Well, like a flash I knew what was up, but just to make sure I went and got the slipper and brought it back, and just like I thought, when he saw it you'd thought we were killing him. So I made Dilsey own up, then I told Mother. We had to take her up to bed then, and after things got quieted down a little I put the fear of God into Dilsey. As much as you can into a nigger, that is. That's the trouble with nigger servants, when they've been with you for a long time they get so full of self importance that they're not worth a dam. Think they run the whole family. ""I like to know whut's de hurt in lettin dat po chile see her own baby,"" Dilsey says. ""If Mr Jason was still here hit ud be different."" ""Only Mr Jason's not here,"" I says. ""I know you wont pay me any mind, but I reckon you'll do what Mother says. You keep on worrying her like this until you get her into the graveyard too, then you can fill the whole house full of ragtag and bobtail. But what did you want to let that",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,81,"dam boy see her for?"" ""You's a cold man, Jason, if man you is,"" she says. ""I thank de Lawd I got mo heart den cat, even ef hit is black."" ""At least I'm man enough to keep that flour barrel full,"" I says. ""And if you do that again, you wont be eating out of it either."" So the next time I told her that if she tried Dilsey again, Mother was going to fire Dilsey and send Ben to Jackson and take Quentin and go away. She looked at me for a while. There wasn't any street light close and I couldn't see her face much. But I could feel her looking at me. When we were little when she'd get mad and couldn't do anything about it her upper lip would begin to jump. Everytime it jumped it would leave a little more of her teeth showing, and all the time she'd be as still as a post, not a muscle moving except her lip jerking higher and higher up her teeth. But she didn't say anything. She just said, ""All right. How much?"" ""Well, if one look through a hack window was worth a hundred,"" I says. So after that she behaved pretty well, only one time she asked to see a statement of the bank account. ""I know they have Mother's indorsement on them,"" she says. ""But I want to see the bank statement. I want to see myself where those checks go."" ""That's in Mother's private business,"" I says. ""If you think you have any right to pry into her private affairs I'll tell her you believe those checks are being misappropriated and you want an audit because you dont trust her."" She didn't say anything or move. I could hear her whispering Damn you oh damn you oh damn you. ""Say it out,"" I says. ""I dont reckon it's any secret what you and I think of one another. Maybe you want the money back,"" I says. ""Listen, Jason,"" she says. ""dont lie to me now. About her. I wont ask to see anything. If that isn't enough, I'll send more each month. Just promise that she'll--that she--You can do that. Things for her. Be kind to her. Little things that I cant, they wont let.... But you wont. You never had a drop of warm blood in you. Listen,"" she says. ""If you'll get Mother to let me have her back, I'll give you a thousand dollars."" ""You haven't got a thousand dollars,"" I says. ""I know you're lying now."" ""Yes I have. I will have. I can get it."" ""And I know how you'll get it,"" I says. ""You'll get it the same way you got her. And when she gets big enough--"" Then I thought she really was going to hit at me, and then I didn't know what she was going to do. She acted for a minute like some kind of a toy that's wound up too tight and about to burst all to pieces. ""Oh, I'm crazy,"" she says. ""I'm insane. I cant take her. Keep her. What am I thinking of. Jason,"" she says, grabbing my arm. Her hands were hot as fever. ""You'll have to promise to take care of her, to-- She's kin to you; your own flesh and blood. Promise, Jason. You have Father's name: do you think I'd have to ask him twice? once, even?"" ""That's so,"" I says. ""He did leave me something. What do you want me to do,"" I says. ""Buy an apron and a gocart? I never got you into this,"" I says. ""I run more risk than you do, because you haven't got anything at stake. So if you expect--"" ""No,"" she says, then she begun to laugh and to try to hold it back all at the same time. ""No. I have nothing at stake,"" she says, making that noise, putting her hands to her mouth. ""Nuh-nuh-nothing,"" she says. ""Here,"" I says. ""Stop that!"" ""I'm tr-trying to,"" she says, holding her hands over her mouth. ""Oh God, oh God."" ""I'm going away from here,"" I says. ""I cant be seen here. You get on out of town now, you hear?"" ""Wait,"" she says, catching my arm. ""I've stopped. I wont again. You promise, Jason?"" she says, and me feeling her eyes almost like they were touching my face. ""You promise? Mother--that--money if sometimes she needs things-- If I send checks for her to you, other ones besides those, you'll give them to her? You wont tell? You'll see that she has things like other girls?"" ""Sure,"" I says. ""As long as you behave and do like I tell you."" And so when Earl came up front with his hat on he says, ""I'm going to step",no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,82,"up to Rogers' and get a snack. We wont have time to go home to dinner, I reckon."" ""What's the matter we wont have time?"" I says. ""With this show in town and all,"" he says. ""They're going to give an afternoon performance too, and they'll all want to get done trading in time to go to it. So we'd better just run up to Rogers'."" ""All right,"" I says. ""It's your stomach. If you want to make a slave of yourself to your business, it's all right with me."" ""I reckon you'll never be a slave to any business,"" he says. ""Not unless it's Jason Compson's business,"" I says. So when I went back and opened it the only thing that surprised me was it was a money order not a check. Yes, sir. You cant trust a one of them. After all the risk I'd taken, risking Mother finding out about her coming down here once or twice a year sometimes, and me having to tell Mother lies about it. That's gratitude for you. And I wouldn't put it past her to try to notify the postoffice not to let anyone except her cash it. Giving a kid like that fifty dollars. Why I never saw fifty dollars until I was twentyone years old, with all the other boys with the afternoon off and all day Saturday and me working in a store. Like I say, how can they expect anybody to control her, with her giving her money behind our backs. She has the same home you had I says, and the same raising. I reckon Mother is a better judge of what she needs than you are, that haven't even got a home. ""If you want to give her money,"" I says, ""you send it to Mother, dont be giving it to her. If I've got to run this risk every few months, you'll have to do like I say, or it's out."" And just about the time I got ready to begin on it because if Earl thought I was going to dash up the street and gobble two bits worth of indigestion on his account he was bad fooled. I may not be sitting with my feet on a mahogany desk but I am being payed for what I do inside this building and if I cant manage to live a civilised life outside of it I'll go where I can. I can stand on my own feet; I dont need any man's mahogany desk to prop me up. So just about the time I got ready to start I'd have to drop everything and run to sell some redneck a dime's worth of nails or something, and Earl up there gobbling a sandwich and half way back already, like as not, and then I found that all the blanks were gone. I remembered then that I had aimed to get some more, but it was too late now, and then I looked up and there she came. In the back door. I heard her asking old Job if I was there. I just had time to stick them in the drawer and close it. She came around to the desk. I looked at my watch. ""You been to dinner already?"" I says. ""It's just twelve; I just heard it strike. You must have flown home and back."" ""I'm not going home to dinner,"" she says. ""Did I get a letter today?"" ""Were you expecting one?"" I says. ""Have you got a sweetie that can write?"" ""From Mother,"" she says. ""Did I get a letter from Mother?"" she says, looking at me. ""Mother got one from her,"" I says. ""I haven't opened it. You'll have to wait until she opens it. She'll let you see it, I imagine."" ""Please, Jason,"" she says, not paying any attention. ""Did I get one?"" ""What's the matter?"" I says. ""I never knew you to be this anxious about anybody. You must expect some money from her."" ""She said she-- "" she says. ""Please, Jason,"" she says. ""Did I?"" ""You must have been to school today, after all,"" I says. ""Somewhere where they taught you to say please. Wait a minute, while I wait on that customer."" I went and waited on him. When I turned to come back she was out of sight behind the desk. I ran. I ran around the desk and caught her as she jerked her hand out of the drawer. I took the letter away from her, beating her knuckles on the desk until she let go. ""You would, would you?"" I says. ""Give it to me,"" she says. ""You've already opened it. Give it to me. Please, Jason. It's mine. I saw the name."" ""I'll take a hame string to you,"" I",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,83,"says. ""That's what I'll give you. Going into my papers."" ""Is there some money in it?"" she says, reaching for it. ""She said she would send me some money. She promised she would. Give it to me."" ""What do you want with money?"" I says. ""She said she would,"" she says. ""Give it to me. Please, Jason. I wont ever ask you anything again, if you'll give it to me this time."" ""I'm going to, if you'll give me time,"" I says. I took the letter and the money order out and gave her the letter. She reached for the money order, not hardly glancing at the letter. ""You'll have to sign it first,"" I says. ""How much is it?"" she says. ""Read the letter,"" I says. ""I reckon it'll say."" She read it fast, in about two looks. ""It dont say,"" she says, looking up. She dropped the letter to the floor. ""How much is it?"" ""It's ten dollars,"" I says. ""Ten dollars?"" she says, staring at me. ""And you ought to be dam glad to get that,"" I says. ""A kid like you. What are you in such a rush for money all of a sudden for?"" ""Ten dollars?"" she says, like she was talking in her sleep. ""Just ten dollars?"" She made a grab at the money order. ""You're lying,"" she says. ""Thief!"" she says. ""Thief!"" ""You would, would you?"" I says, holding her off. ""Give it to me!"" she says. ""It's mine. She sent it to me. I will see it. I will."" ""You will?"" I says, holding her. ""How're you going to do it?"" ""Just let me see it, Jason,"" she says. ""Please. I wont ask you for anything again."" ""Think I'm lying, do you?"" I says. ""Just for that you wont see it."" ""But just ten dollars,"" she says. ""She told me she--she told me--Jason, please please please. I've got to have some money. I've just got to. Give it to me, Jason. I'll do anything if you will."" ""Tell me what you've got to have money for,"" I says. ""I've got to have it,"" she says. She was looking at me. Then all of a sudden she quit looking at me without moving her eyes at all. I knew she was going to lie. ""It's some money I owe,"" she says. ""I've got to pay it. I've got to pay it today."" ""Who to?"" I says. Her hands were sort of twisting. I could watch her trying to think of a lie to tell. ""Have you been charging things at stores again?"" I says. ""You needn't bother to tell me that. If you can find anybody in this town that'll charge anything to you after what I told them, I'll eat it."" ""It's a girl,"" she says. ""It's a girl. I borrowed some money from a girl. I've got to pay it back. Jason, give it to me. Please. I'll do anything. I've got to have it. Mother will pay you. I'll write to her to pay you and that I wont ever ask her for anything again. You can see the letter. Please, Jason. I've got to have it."" ""Tell me what you want with it, and I'll see about it,"" I says. ""Tell me."" She just stood there, with her hands working against her dress. ""All right,"" I says. ""If ten dollars is too little for you, I'll just take it home to Mother, and you know what'll happen to it then. Of course, if you're so rich you dont need ten dollars--"" She stood there, looking at the floor, kind of mumbling to herself. ""She said she would send me some money. She said she sends money here and you say she dont send any. She said she's sent a lot of money here. She says it's for me. That it's for me to have some of it. And you say we haven't got any money."" ""You know as much about that as I do,"" I says. ""You've seen what happens to those checks."" ""Yes,"" she says, looking at the floor. ""Ten dollars,"" she says. ""Ten dollars."" ""And you'd better thank your stars it's ten dollars,"" I says. ""Here,"" I says. I put the money order face down on the desk, holding my hand on it. ""Sign it."" ""Will you let me see it?"" she says. ""I just want to look at it. Whatever it says, I wont ask for but ten dollars. You can have the rest. I just want to see it."" ""Not after the way you've acted,"" I says. ""You've got to learn one thing, and that is that when I tell you to do something, you've got it to do. You sign your name on that line."" She took the pen, but instead of signing it",no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,84,"she just stood there with her head bent and the pen shaking in her hand. Just like her mother. ""Oh, God,"" she says, ""oh, God."" ""Yes,"" I says. ""That's one thing you'll have to learn if you never learn anything else. Sign it now, and get on out of here."" She signed it. ""Where's the money?"" she says. I took the order and blotted it and put it in my pocket. Then I gave her the ten dollars. ""Now you go on back to school this afternoon, you hear?"" I says. She didn't answer. She crumpled the bill up in her hand like it was a rag or something and went on out the front door just as Earl came in. A customer came in with him and they stopped up front. I gathered up the things and put on my hat and went up front. ""Been much busy?"" Earl says. ""Not much,"" I says. He looked out the door. ""That your car over yonder?"" he says. ""Better not try to go out home to dinner. We'll likely have another rush just before the show opens. Get you a lunch at Rogers' and put a ticket in the drawer."" ""Much obliged,"" I says. ""I can still manage to feed myself, I reckon."" And right there he'd stay, watching that door like a hawk until I came through it again. Well, he'd just have to watch it for a while; I was doing the best I could. The time before I says that's the last one now; you'll have to remember to get some more right away. But who can remember anything in all this hurrah. And now this dam show had to come here the one day I'd have to hunt all over town for a blank check, besides all the other things I had to do to keep the house running, and Earl watching the door like a hawk. I went to the printing shop and told him I wanted to play a joke on a fellow, but he didn't have anything. Then he told me to have a look in the old opera house, where somebody had stored a lot of papers and junk out of the old Merchants' and Farmers' Bank when it failed, so I dodged up a few more alleys so Earl couldn't see me and finally found old man Simmons and got the key from him and went up there and dug around. At last I found a pad on a Saint Louis bank. And of course she'd pick this one time to look at it close. Well, it would have to do. I couldn't waste any more time now. I went back to the store. ""Forgot some papers Mother wants to go to the bank,"" I says. I went back to the desk and fixed the check. Trying to hurry and all, I says to myself it's a good thing her eyes are giving out, with that little whore in the house, a Christian forbearing woman like Mother. I says you know just as well as I do what she's going to grow up into but I says that's your business, if you want to keep her and raise her in your house just because of Father. Then she would begin to cry and say it was her own flesh and blood so I just says All right. Have it your way. I can stand it if you can. I fixed the letter up again and glued it back and went out. ""Try not to be gone any longer than you can help,"" Earl says. ""All right,"" I says. I went to the telegraph office. The smart boys were all there. ""Any of you boys made your million yet?"" I says. ""Who can do anything, with a market like that?"" Doc says. ""What's it doing?"" I says. I went in and looked. It was three points under the opening. ""You boys are not going to let a little thing like the cotton market beat you, are you?"" I says. ""I thought you were too smart for that."" ""Smart, hell,"" Doc says. ""It was down twelve points at twelve oclock. Cleaned me out."" ""Twelve points?"" I says. ""Why the hell didn't somebody let me know? Why didn't you let me know?"" I says to the operator. ""I take it as it comes in,"" he says. ""I'm not running a bucket shop."" ""You're smart, aren't you?"" I says. ""Seems to me, with the money I spend with you, you could take time to call me up. Or maybe your dam company's in a conspiracy with those dam eastern sharks."" He didn't say anything. He made like he was busy. ""You're getting a little too big for your pants,"" I says. ""First thing you know you'll",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,85,"be working for a living."" ""What's the matter with you?"" Doc says. ""You're still three points to the good."" ""Yes,"" I says. ""If I happened to be selling. I haven't mentioned that yet, I think. You boys all cleaned out?"" ""I got caught twice,"" Doc says. ""I switched just in time."" ""Well,"" I. O. Snopes says. ""I've picked hit; I reckon taint no more than fair fer hit to pick me once in a while."" So I left them buying and selling among themselves at a nickel a point. I found a nigger and sent him for my car and stood on the corner and waited. I couldn't see Earl looking up and down the street, with one eye on the clock, because I couldn't see the door from here. After about a week he got back with it. ""Where the hell have you been?"" I says. ""Riding around where the wenches could see you?"" ""I come straight as I could,"" he says. ""I had to drive clean around the square, wid all dem wagons."" I never found a nigger yet that didn't have an airtight alibi for whatever he did. But just turn one loose in a car and he's bound to show off. I got in and went on around the square. I caught a glimpse of Earl in the door across the square. I went straight to the kitchen and told Dilsey to hurry up with dinner. ""Quentin aint come yit,"" she says. ""What of that?"" I says. ""You'll be telling me next that Luster's not quite ready to eat yet. Quentin knows when meals are served in this house. Hurry up with it, now."" Mother was in her room. I gave her the letter. She opened it and took the check out and sat holding it in her hand. I went and got the shovel from the corner and gave her a match. ""Come on,"" I says. ""Get it over with. You'll be crying in a minute."" She took the match, but she didn't strike it. She sat there, looking at the check. Just like I said it would be. ""I hate to do it,"" she says. ""To increase your burden by adding Quentin...."" ""I guess we'll get along,"" I says. ""Come on. Get it over with."" But she just sat there, holding the check. ""This one is on a different bank,"" she says. ""They have been on an Indianapolis bank."" ""Yes,"" I says. ""Women are allowed to do that too."" ""Do what?"" she says. ""Keep money in two different banks,"" I says. ""Oh,"" she says. She looked at the check a while. ""I'm glad to know she's so ... she has so much.... God sees that I am doing right,"" she says. ""Come on,"" I says. ""Finish it. Get the fun over."" ""Fun?"" she says. ""When I think--"" ""I thought you were burning this two hundred dollars a month for fun,"" I says. ""Come on, now. Want me to strike the match?"" ""I could bring myself to accept them,"" she says. ""For my children's sake. I have no pride."" ""You'd never be satisfied,"" I says. ""You know you wouldn't. You've settled that once, let it stay settled. We can get along."" ""I leave everything to you,"" she says. ""But sometimes I become afraid that in doing this I am depriving you all of what is rightfully yours. Perhaps I shall be punished for it. If you want me to, I will smother my pride and accept them."" ""What would be the good in beginning now, when you've been destroying them for fifteen years?"" I says. ""If you keep on doing it, you have lost nothing, but if you'd begin to take them now, you'll have lost fifty thousand dollars. We've got along so far, haven't we?"" I says. ""I haven't seen you in the poorhouse yet."" ""Yes,"" she says. ""We Bascombs need nobody's charity. Certainly not that of a fallen woman."" She struck the match and lit the check and put it in the shovel, and then the envelope, and watched them burn. ""You dont know what it is,"" she says. ""Thank God you will never know what a mother feels."" ""There are lots of women in this world no better than her,"" I says. ""But they are not my daughters,"" she says. ""It's not myself,"" she says. ""I'd gladly take her back, sins and all, because she is my flesh and blood. It's for Quentin's sake."" Well, I could have said it wasn't much chance of anybody hurting Quentin much, but like I say I dont expect much but I do want to eat and sleep without a couple of women squabbling and crying in the house. ""And yours,"" she says. ""I know how you feel toward her."" ""Let her come back,"" I says,",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,86,"""far as I'm concerned."" ""No,"" she says. ""I owe that to your father's memory."" ""When he was trying all the time to persuade you to let her come home when Herbert threw her out?"" I says. ""You dont understand,"" she says. ""I know you dont intend to make it more difficult for me. But it's my place to suffer for my children,"" she says. ""I can bear it."" ""Seems to me you go to a lot of unnecessary trouble doing it,"" I says. The paper burned out. I carried it to the grate and put it in. ""It just seems a shame to me to burn up good money,"" I says. ""Let me never see the day when my children will have to accept that, the wages of sin,"" she says. ""I'd rather see even you dead in your coffin first."" ""Have it your way,"" I says. ""Are we going to have dinner soon?"" I says. ""Because if we're not, I'll have to go on back. We're pretty busy today."" She got up. ""I've told her once,"" I says. ""It seems she's waiting on Quentin or Luster or somebody. Here, I'll call her. Wait."" But she went to the head of the stairs and called. ""Quentin aint come yit,"" Dilsey says. ""Well, I'll have to get on back,"" I says. ""I can get a sandwich downtown. I dont want to interfere with Dilsey's arrangements,"" I says. Well, that got her started again, with Dilsey hobbling and mumbling back and forth, saying, ""All right, all right, Ise puttin hit on fast as I kin."" ""I try to please you all,"" Mother says. ""I try to make things as easy for you as I can."" ""I'm not complaining, am I?"" I says. ""Have I said a word except I had to go back to work?"" ""I know,"" she says. ""I know you haven't had the chance the others had, that you've had to bury yourself in a little country store. I wanted you to get ahead. I knew your father would never realise that you were the only one who had any business sense, and then when everything else failed I believed that when she married, and Herbert ... after his promise--"" ""Well, he was probably lying too,"" I says. ""He may not have even had a bank. And if he had, I dont reckon he'd have to come all the way to Mississippi to get a man for it."" We ate a while. I could hear Ben in the kitchen, where Luster was feeding him. Like I say, if we've got to feed another mouth and she wont take that money, why not send him down to Jackson. He'll be happier there, with people like him. I says God knows there's little enough room for pride in this family, but it dont take much pride to not like to see a thirty year old man playing around the yard with a nigger boy, running up and down the fence and lowing like a cow whenever they play golf over there. I says if they'd sent him to Jackson at first we'd all be better off today. I says, you've done your duty by him; you've done all anybody can expect of you and more than most folks would do, so why not send him there and get that much benefit out of the taxes we pay. Then she says, ""I'll be gone soon. I know I'm just a burden to you"" and I says ""You've been saying that so long that I'm beginning to believe you"" only I says you'd better be sure and not let me know you're gone because I'll sure have him on number seventeen that night and I says I think I know a place where they'll take her too and the name of it's not Milk street and Honey avenue either. Then she begun to cry and I says All right all right I have as much pride about my kinfolks as anybody even if I dont always know where they come from. We ate for a while. Mother sent Dilsey to the front to look for Quentin again. ""I keep telling you she's not coming to dinner,"" I says. ""She knows better than that,"" Mother says. ""She knows I dont permit her to run about the streets and not come home at meal time. Did you look good, Dilsey?"" ""Dont let her, then,"" I says. ""What can I do,"" she says. ""You have all of you flouted me. Always."" ""If you wouldn't come interfering, I'd make her mind,"" I says. ""It wouldn't take me but about one day to straighten her out."" ""You'd be too brutal with her,"" she says. ""You have your Uncle Maury's temper."" That reminded me of the letter. I took it",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,87,"out and handed it to her. ""You wont have to open it,"" I says. ""The bank will let you know how much it is this time."" ""It's addressed to you,"" she says. ""Go on and open it,"" I says. She opened it and read it and handed it to me. "" 'My dear young nephew', it says, 'You will be glad to learn that I am now in a position to avail myself of an opportunity regarding which, for reasons which I shall make obvious to you, I shall not go into details until I have an opportunity to divulge it to you in a more secure manner. My business experience has taught me to be chary of committing anything of a confidential nature to any more concrete medium than speech, and my extreme precaution in this instance should give you some inkling of its value. Needless to say, I have just completed a most exhaustive examination of all its phases, and I feel no hesitancy in telling you that it is that sort of golden chance that comes but once in a lifetime, and I now see clearly before me that goal toward which I have long and unflaggingly striven: i.e., the ultimate solidification of my affairs by which I may restore to its rightful position that family of which I have the honor to be the sole remaining male descendant; that family in which I have ever included your lady mother and her children. 'As it so happens, I am not quite in a position to avail myself of this opportunity to the uttermost which it warrants, but rather than go out of the family to do so, I am today drawing upon your Mother's bank for the small sum necessary to complement my own initial investment, for which I herewith enclose, as a matter of formality, my note of hand at eight percent. per annum. Needless to say, this is merely a formality, to secure your Mother in the event of that circumstance of which man is ever the plaything and sport. For naturally I shall employ this sum as though it were my own and so permit your Mother to avail herself of this opportunity which my exhaustive investigation has shown to be a bonanza--if you will permit the vulgarism--of the first water and purest ray serene. 'This is in confidence, you will understand, from one business man to another; we will harvest our own vineyards, eh? And knowing your Mother's delicate health and that timorousness which such delicately nurtured Southern ladies would naturally feel regarding matters of business, and their charming proneness to divulge unwittingly such matters in conversation, I would suggest that you do not mention it to her at all. On second thought, I advise you not to do so. It might be better to simply restore this sum to the bank at some future date, say, in a lump sum with the other small sums for which I am indebted to her, and say nothing about it at all. It is our duty to shield her from the crass material world as much as possible. 'Your affectionate Uncle, 'Maury L. Bascomb.' "" ""What do you want to do about it?"" I says, flipping it across the table. ""I know you grudge what I give him,"" she says. ""It's your money,"" I says. ""If you want to throw it to the birds even, it's your business."" ""He's my own brother,"" Mother says. ""He's the last Bascomb. When we are gone there wont be any more of them."" ""That'll be hard on somebody, I guess,"" I says. ""All right, all right,"" I says. ""It's your money. Do as you please with it. You want me to tell the bank to pay it?"" ""I know you begrudge him,"" she says. ""I realise the burden on your shoulders. When I'm gone it will be easier on you."" ""I could make it easier right now,"" I says. ""All right, all right, I wont mention it again. Move all bedlam in here if you want to."" ""He's your own brother,"" she says. ""Even if he is afflicted."" ""I'll take your bank book,"" I says. ""I'll draw my check today."" ""He kept you waiting six days,"" she says. ""Are you sure the business is sound? It seems strange to me that a solvent business cannot pay its employees promptly."" ""He's all right,"" I says. ""Safe as a bank. I tell him not to bother about mine until we get done collecting every month. That's why it's late sometimes."" ""I just couldn't bear to have you lose the little I had to invest for you,"" she says. ""I've often thought that Earl is not a good business man. I know he doesn't take you into his confidence to the extent",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,88,"that your investment in the business should warrant. I'm going to speak to him."" ""No, you let him alone,"" I says. ""It's his business."" ""You have a thousand dollars in it."" ""You let him alone,"" I says. ""I'm watching things. I have your power of attorney. It'll be all right."" ""You dont know what a comfort you are to me,"" she says. ""You have always been my pride and joy, but when you came to me of your own accord and insisted on banking your salary each month in my name, I thanked God it was you left me if they had to be taken."" ""They were all right,"" I says. ""They did the best they could, I reckon."" ""When you talk that way I know you are thinking bitterly of your father's memory,"" she says. ""You have a right to, I suppose. But it breaks my heart to hear you."" I got up. ""If you've got any crying to do,"" I says, ""you'll have to do it alone, because I've got to get on back. I'll get the bank book."" ""I'll get it,"" she says. ""Keep still,"" I says. ""I'll get it."" I went up stairs and got the bank book out of her desk and went back to town. I went to the bank and deposited the check and the money order and the other ten, and stopped at the telegraph office. It was one point above the opening. I had already lost thirteen points, all because she had to come helling in there at twelve, worrying me about that letter. ""What time did that report come in?"" I says. ""About an hour ago,"" he says. ""An hour ago?"" I says. ""What are we paying you for?"" I says. ""Weekly reports? How do you expect a man to do anything? The whole dam top could blow off and we'd not know it."" ""I dont expect you to do anything,"" he says. ""They changed that law making folks play the cotton market."" ""They have?"" I says. ""I hadn't heard. They must have sent the news out over the Western Union."" I went back to the store. Thirteen points. Dam if I believe anybody knows anything about the dam thing except the ones that sit back in those New York offices and watch the country suckers come up and beg them to take their money. Well, a man that just calls shows he has no faith in himself, and like I say if you aren't going to take the advice, what's the use in paying money for it. Besides, these people are right up there on the ground; they know everything that's going on. I could feel the telegram in my pocket. I'd just have to prove that they were using the telegraph company to defraud. That would constitute a bucket shop. And I wouldn't hesitate that long, either. Only be damned if it doesn't look like a company as big and rich as the Western Union could get a market report out on time. Half as quick as they'll get a wire to you saying Your account closed out. But what the hell do they care about the people. They're hand in glove with that New York crowd. Anybody could see that. When I came in Earl looked at his watch. But he didn't say anything until the customer was gone. Then he says, ""You go home to dinner?"" ""I had to go to the dentist,"" I says because it's not any of his business where I eat but I've got to be in the store with him all the afternoon. And with his jaw running off after all I've stood. You take a little two by four country storekeeper like I say it takes a man with just five hundred dollars to worry about it fifty thousand dollars' worth. ""You might have told me,"" he says. ""I expected you back right away."" ""I'll trade you this tooth and give you ten dollars to boot, any time,"" I says. ""Our agreement was an hour for dinner,"" I says, ""and if you dont like the way I do, you know what you can do about it."" ""I've known that some time,"" he says. ""If it hadn't been for your mother I'd have done it before now, too. She's a lady I've got a lot of sympathy for, Jason. Too bad some other folks I know cant say as much."" ""Then you can keep it,"" I says. ""When we need any sympathy I'll let you know in plenty of time."" ""I've protected you about that business a long time, Jason,"" he says. ""Yes?"" I says, letting him go on. Listening to what he would say before I shut him up. ""I believe I know more about where that automobile came from",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,89,"than she does."" ""You think so, do you?"" I says. ""When are you going to spread the news that I stole it from my mother?"" ""I dont say anything,"" he says. ""I know you have her power of attorney. And I know she still believes that thousand dollars is in this business."" ""All right,"" I says. ""Since you know so much, I'll tell you a little more: go to the bank and ask them whose account I've been depositing a hundred and sixty dollars on the first of every month for twelve years."" ""I dont say anything,"" he says. ""I just ask you to be a little more careful after this."" I never said anything more. It doesn't do any good. I've found that when a man gets into a rut the best thing you can do is let him stay there. And when a man gets it in his head that he's got to tell something on you for your own good, goodnight. I'm glad I haven't got the sort of conscience I've got to nurse like a sick puppy all the time. If I'd ever be as careful over anything as he is to keep his little shirt tail full of business from making him more than eight percent. I reckon he thinks they'd get him on the usury law if he netted more than eight percent. What the hell chance has a man got, tied down in a town like this and to a business like this. Why I could take his business in one year and fix him so he'd never have to work again, only he'd give it all away to the church or something. If there's one thing gets under my skin, it's a dam hypocrite. A man that thinks anything he dont understand all about must be crooked and that first chance he gets he's morally bound to tell the third party what's none of his business to tell. Like I say if I thought every time a man did something I didn't know all about he was bound to be a crook, I reckon I wouldn't have any trouble finding something back there on those books that you wouldn't see any use for running and telling somebody I thought ought to know about it, when for all I knew they might know a dam sight more about it now than I did, and if they didn't it was dam little of my business anyway and he says, ""My books are open to anybody. Anybody that has any claim or believes she has any claim on this business can go back there and welcome."" ""Sure, you wont tell,"" I says. ""You couldn't square your conscience with that. You'll just take her back there and let her find it. You wont tell, yourself."" ""I'm not trying to meddle in your business,"" he says. ""I know you missed out on some things like Quentin had. But your mother has had a misfortunate life too, and if she was to come in here and ask me why you quit, I'd have to tell her. It aint that thousand dollars. You know that. It's because a man never gets anywhere if fact and his ledgers dont square. And I'm not going to lie to anybody, for myself or anybody else."" ""Well, then,"" I says. ""I reckon that conscience of yours is a more valuable clerk than I am; it dont have to go home at noon to eat. Only dont let it interfere with my appetite,"" I says, because how the hell can I do anything right, with that dam family and her not making any effort to control her nor any of them like that time when she happened to see one of them kissing Caddy and all next day she went around the house in a black dress and a veil and even Father couldn't get her to say a word except crying and saying her little daughter was dead and Caddy about fifteen then only in three years she'd been wearing haircloth or probably sandpaper at that rate. Do you think I can afford to have her running about the streets with every drummer that comes to town, I says, and them telling the new ones up and down the toad where to pick up a hot one when they made Jefferson. I haven't got much pride, I cant afford it with a kitchen full of niggers to feed and robbing the state asylum of its star freshman. Blood, I says, governors and generals. It's a dam good thing we never had any kings and presidents; we'd all be down there at Jackson chasing butterflies. I says it'd be bad enough if it was mine; I'd at least be sure it was a bastard",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,90,"to begin with, and now even the Lord doesn't know that for certain probably. So after a while I heard the band start up, and then they begun to clear out. Headed for the show, every one of them. Haggling over a twenty cent hame string to save fifteen cents, so they can give it to a bunch of Yankees that come in and pay maybe ten dollars for the privilege. I went on out to the back. ""Well,"" I says. ""If you dont look out, that bolt will grow into your hand. And then I'm going to take an axe and chop it out. What do you reckon the boll-weevils'll eat if you dont get those cultivators in shape to raise them a crop?"" I says, ""sage grass?"" ""Dem folks sho do play dem horns,"" he says. ""Tell me man in dat show kin play a tune on a handsaw. Pick hit like a banjo."" ""Listen,"" I says. ""Do you know how much that show'll spend in this town? About ten dollars,"" I says. ""The ten dollars Buck Turpin has in his pocket right now."" ""Whut dey give Mr Buck ten dollars fer?"" he says. ""For the privilege of showing here,"" I says. ""You can put the balance of what they'll spend in your eye."" ""You mean dey pays ten dollars jest to give dey show here?"" he says. ""That's all,"" I says. ""And how much do you reckon--"" ""Gret day,"" he says. ""You mean to tell me dey chargin um to let um show here? I'd pay ten dollars to see dat man pick dat saw, ef I had to. I figures dat tomorrow mawnin I be still owin um nine dollars and six bits at dat rate."" And then a Yankee will talk your head off about niggers getting ahead. Get them ahead, what I say. Get them so far ahead you cant find one south of Louisville with a blood hound. Because when I told him about how they'd pick up Saturday night and carry off at least a thousand dollars out of the county, he says, ""I dont begridge um. I kin sho afford my two bits."" ""Two bits hell,"" I says. ""That dont begin it. How about the dime or fifteen cents you'll spend for a dam two cent box of candy or something. How about the time you're wasting right now, listening to that band."" ""Dat's de troof,"" he says. ""Well, ef I lives swell night hit's ""wine to be two bits mo dey takin out of town, cat's shot"" ""Then you're a fool,"" I says. ""Well,"" he says. ""I dont spute dat neither. Ef dat uz a crime, all chain- gangs wouldn't be black."" Well, just about that time I happened to look up the alley and saw her. When I stepped back and looked at my watch I didn't notice at the time who he was because I was looking at the watch. It was just two thirty, forty- five minutes before anybody but me expected her to be out. So when I looked around the door the first thing I saw was the red tie he had on and I was thinking what the hell kind of a man would wear a red tie. But she was sneaking along the alley, watching the door, so I wasn't thinking anything about him until they had gone past. I was wondering if she'd have so little respect for me that she'd not only play out of school when I told her not to, but would walk right past the store, daring me not to see her. Only she couldn't see into the door because the sun fell straight into it and it was like trying to see through an automobile searchlight, so I stood there and watched her go on past, with her face painted up like a dam clown's and her hair all gummed and twisted and a dress that if a woman had come out doors even on Gayoso or Beale street when I was a young fellow with no more than that to cover her legs and behind, she'd been thrown in jail. I'll be damned if they dont dress like they were trying to make every man they passed on the street want to reach out and clap his hand on it. And so I was thinking what kind of a dam man would wear a red tie when all of a sudden I knew he was one of those show folks well as if she'd told me. Well, I can stand a lot; if I couldn't dam if I wouldn't be in a hell of a fix, so when they turned the corner I jumped down and followed. Me, without any hat, in the middle of the",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,91,"afternoon, having to chase up and down back alleys because of my mother's good name. Like I say you cant do anything with a woman like that, if she's got it in her. If it's in her blood, you cant do anything with her. The only thing you can do is to get rid of her, let her go on and live with her own sort. I went on to the street, but they were out of sight. And there I was, without any hat, looking like I was crazy too. Like a man would naturally think, one of them is crazy and another one drowned himself and the other one was turned out into the street by her husband, what's the reason the rest of them are not crazy too. All the time I could see them watching me like a hawk, waiting for a chance to say Well I'm not surprised I expected it all the time the whole family's crazy. Selling land to send him to Harvard and paying taxes to support a state University all the time that I never saw except twice at a baseball game and not letting her daughter's name be spoken on the place until after a while Father wouldn't even come down town anymore but just sat there all day with the decanter I could see the bottom of his nightshirt and his bare legs and hear the decanter clinking until finally T.P. had to pour it for him and she says You have no respect for your Father's memory and I says I dont know why not it sure is preserved well enough to last only if I'm crazy too God knows what I'll do about it just to look at water makes me sick and I'd just as soon swallow gasoline as a glass of whiskey and Lorraine telling them he may not drink but if you dont believe he's a man I can tell you how to find out she says If I catch you fooling with any of these whores you know what I'll do she says I'll whip her grabbing at her I'll whip her as long as I can find her she says and I says if I dont drink that's my business but have you ever found me short I says I'll buy you enough beer to take a bath in if you want it because I've got every respect for a good honest whore because with Mother's health and the position I try to uphold to have her with no more respect for what I try to do for her than to make her name and my name and my Mother's name a byword in the town. She had dodged out of sight somewhere. Saw me coming and dodged into another alley, running up and down the alleys with a dam show man in a red tie that everybody would look at and think what kind of a dam man would wear a red tie. Well, the boy kept speaking to me and so I took the telegram without knowing I had taken it. I didn't realise what it was until I was signing for it, and I tore it open without even caring much what it was. I knew all the time what it would be, I reckon. That was the only thing else that could happen, especially holding it up until I had already had the check entered on the pass book. I dont see how a city no bigger than New York can hold enough people to take the money away from us country suckers. Work like hell all day every day, send them your money and get a little piece of paper back, Your account closed at 20.62. Teasing you along, letting you pile up a little paper profit, then banal Your account closed at 20.62. And if that wasn't enough, paying ten dollars a month to somebody to tell you how to lose it fast, that either dont know anything about it or is in cahoots with the telegraph company. Well, I'm done with them. They've sucked me in for the last time. Any fool except a fellow that hasn't got any more sense than to take a jew's word for anything could tell the market was going up all the time, with the whole dam delta about to be flooded again and the cotton washed right out of the ground like it was last year. Let it wash a man's crop out of the ground year after year, and them up there in Washington spending fifty thousand dollars a day keeping an army in Nicarauga or some place. Of course it'll overflow again, and then cotton'll be worth thirty cents a pound. Well, I just want to",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,92,"hit them one time and get my money back. I dont want a killing; only these small town gamblers are out for that, I just want my money back that these dam jews have gotten with all their guaranteed inside dope. Then I'm through; they can kiss my foot for every other red cent of mine they get. I went back to the store. It was half past three almost. Dam little time to do anything in, but then I am used to that. I never had to go to Harvard to learn that. The band had quit playing. Got them all inside now, and they wouldn't have to waste any more wind. Earl says, ""He found you, did he? He was in here with it a while ago. I thought you were out back somewhere."" ""Yes,"" I says. ""I got it. They couldn't keep it away from me all afternoon. The town's too small. I've got to go out home a minute,"" I says. ""You can dock me if it'll make you feel any better."" ""Go ahead,"" he says. ""I can handle it now. No bad news, I hope."" ""You'll have to go to the telegraph office and find that out,"" I says. ""They'll have time to tell you. I haven't."" ""I just asked,"" he says. ""Your mother knows she can depend on me."" ""She'll appreciate it,"" I says. ""I wont be gone any longer than I have to."" ""Take your time,"" he says. ""I can handle it now. You go ahead."" I got the car and went home. Once this morning, twice at noon, and now again, with her and having to chase all over town and having to beg them to let me eat a little of the food I am paying for. Sometimes I think what's the use of anything. With the precedent I've been set I must be crazy to keep on. And now I reckon I'll get home just in time to take a nice long drive after a basket of tomatoes or something and then have to go back to town smelling like a camphor factory so my head wont explode right on my shoulders. I keep telling her there's not a dam thing in that aspirin except flour and water for imaginary invalids. I says you dont know what a headache is. I says you think I'd fool with that dam car at all if it depended on me. I says I can get along without one I've learned to get along without lots of things but if you want to risk yourself in that old wornout surrey with a halfgrown nigger boy all right because I says God looks after Ben's kind, God knows He ought to do something for him but if you think I'm going to trust a thousand dollars' worth of delicate machinery to a halfgrown nigger or a grown one either, you'd better buy him one yourself because I says you like to ride in the car and you know you do. Dilsey said she was in the house. I went on into the hall and listened, but I didn't hear anything. I went up stairs, but just as I passed her door she called me. ""I just wanted to know who it was,"" she says. ""I'm here alone so much that I hear every sound."" ""You dont have to stay here,"" I says. ""You could spend the whole day visiting like other women, if you wanted to."" She came to the door. ""I thought maybe you were sick,"" she says. ""Having to hurry through your dinner like you did."" ""Better luck next time,"" I says. ""What do you want?"" ""Is anything wrong?"" she says. ""What could be?"" I says. ""Cant I come home in the middle of the afternoon without upsetting the whole house?"" ""Have you seen Quentin?"" she says. ""She's in school,"" I says. ""It's after three,"" she says. ""I heard the clock strike at least a half an hour ago. She ought to be home by now."" ""Ought she?"" I says. ""When have you ever seen her before dark?"" ""She ought to be home,"" she says. ""When I was a girl--"" ""You had somebody to make you behave yourself,"" I says. ""She hasn't."" ""I cant do anything with her,"" she says. ""I've tried and I've tried."" ""And you wont let me, for some reason,"" I says. ""So you ought to be satisfied."" I went on to my room. I turned the key easy and stood there until the knob turned. Then she says, ""Jason."" ""What,"" I says. ""I just thought something was wrong."" ""Not in here,"" I says. ""You've come to the wrong place."" ""I dont mean to worry you,"" she says. ""I'm glad to hear that,"" I says. ""I wasn't sure. I thought",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,93,"I might have been mistaken. Do you want anything?"" After a while she says, ""No. Not any thing."" Then she went away. I took the box down and counted out the money and hid the box again and unlocked the door and went out. I thought about the camphor, but it would be too late now, anyway. And I'd just have one more round trip. She was at her door, waiting. ""You want anything from town?"" I says. ""No,"" she says. ""I dont mean to meddle in your affairs. But I dont know what I'd do if anything happened to you, Jason."" ""I'm all right,"" I says. ""Just a headache."" ""I wish you'd take some aspirin,"" she says. ""I know you're not going to stop using the car."" ""What's the car got to do with it?"" I says. ""How can a car give a man a headache?"" ""You know gasoline always made you sick,"" she says. ""Ever since you were a child. I wish you'd take some aspirin."" ""Keep on wishing it,"" I says. ""It wont hurt you."" I got in the car and started back to town. I had just turned onto the street when I saw a ford coming helling toward me. All of a sudden it stopped. I could hear the wheels sliding and it slewed around and backed and whirled and just as I was thinking what the hell they were up to, I saw that red tie. Then I recognised her face looking back through the window. It whirled into the alley. I saw it turn again, but when I got to the back street it was just disappearing, running like hell. I saw red. When I recognised that red tie, after all I had told her, I forgot about everything. I never thought about my head even until I came to the first forks and had to stop. Yet we spend money and spend money on roads and dam if it isn't like trying to drive over a sheet of corrugated iron roofing. I'd like to know how a man could be expected to keep up with even a wheelbarrow. I think too much of my car; I'm not going to hammer it to pieces like it was a ford. Chances were they had stolen it, anyway, so why should they give a dam. Like I say blood always tells. If you've got blood like that in you, you'll do anything. I says whatever claim you believe she has on you has already been discharged; I says from now on you have only yourself to blame because you know what any sensible person would do. I says if I've got to spend half my time being a dam detective, at least I'll go where I can get paid for it. So I had to stop there at the forks. Then I remembered it. It felt like somebody was inside with a hammer, beating on it. I says I've tried to keep you from being worried by her; I says far as I'm concerned, let her go to hell as fast as she pleases and the sooner the better. I says what else do you expect except every dam drummer and cheap show that comes to town because even these town jellybeans give her the go-by now. You dont know what goes on I says, you dont hear the talk that I hear and you can just bet I shut them up too. I says my people owned slaves here when you all were running little shirt tail country stores and farming land no nigger would look at on shares. If they ever farmed it. It's a good thing the Lord did something for this country; the folks that live on it never have. Friday afternoon, and from right here I could see three miles of land that hadn't even been broken, and every able bodied man in the county in town at that show. I might have been a stranger starving to death, and there wasn't a soul in sight to ask which way to town even. And she trying to get me to take aspirin. I says when I eat bread I'll do it at the table. I says you always talking about how much you give up for us when you could buy ten new dresses a year on the money you spend for those dam patent medicines. It's not something to cure it I need it's just an even break not to have to have them but as long as I have to work ten hours a day to support a kitchen full of niggers in the style they're accustomed to and send them to the show where every other nigger in the county, only he was late already. By the",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,94,"time he got there it would be over. After a while he got up to the car and when I finally got it through his head if two people in a ford had passed him, he said yes. So I went on, and when I came to where the wagon road turned off I could see the tire tracks. Ab Russell was in his lot, but I didn't bother to ask him and I hadn't got out of sight of his barn hardly when I saw the ford. They had tried to hide it. Done about as well at it as she did at everything else she did. Like I say it's not that I object to so much; maybe she cant help that, it's because she hasn't even got enough consideration for her own family to have any discretion. I'm afraid all the time I'll run into them right in the middle of the street or under a wagon on the square, like a couple of dogs. I parked and got out. And now I'd have to go way around and cross a plowed field, the only one I had seen since I left town, with every step like somebody was walking along behind me, hitting me on the head with a club. I kept thinking that when I got across the field at least I'd have something level to walk on, that wouldn't jolt me every step, but when I got into the woods it was full of underbrush and I had to twist around through it, and then I came to a ditch full of briers. I went along it for a while, but it got thicker and thicker, and all the time Earl probably telephoning home about where I was and getting Mother all upset again. When I finally got through I had had to wind around so much that I had to stop and figure out just where the car would be. I knew they wouldn't be far from it, just under the closest bush, so I turned and worked back toward the road. Then I couldn't tell just how far I was, so I'd have to stop and listen, and then with my legs not using so much blood, it all would go into my head like it would explode any minute, and the sun getting down just to where it could shine straight into my eyes and my ears ringing so I couldn't hear anything. I went on, trying to move quiet, then I heard a dog or something and I knew that when he scented me he'd have to come helling up, then it would be all off. I had gotten beggar lice and twigs and stuff all over me, inside my clothes and shoes and all, and then I happened to look around and I had my hand right on a bunch of poison oak. The only thing I couldn't understand was why it was just poison oak and not a snake or something. So I didn't even bother to move it. I just stood there until the dog went away. Then I went on. I didn't have any idea where the car was now. I couldn't think about anything except my head, and I'd just stand in one place and sort of wonder if I had really seen a ford even, and I didn't even care much whether I had or not. Like I say, let her lay out all day and all night with everthing in town that wears pants, what do I care. I dont owe anything to anybody that has no more consideration for me, that wouldn't be a dam bit above planting that ford there and making me spend a whole afternoon and Earl taking her back there and showing her the books just because he's too dam virtuous for this world. I says you'll have one hell of a time in heaven, without anybody's business to meddle in only dont you ever let me catch you at it I says, I close my eyes to it because of your grandmother, but just you let me catch you doing it one time on this place, where my mother lives. These dam little slick haired squirts, thinking they are raising so much hell, I'll show them something about hell I says, and you too. I'll make him think that dam red tie is the latch string to hell, if he thinks he can run the woods with my niece. With the sun and all in my eyes and my blood going so I kept thinking every time my head would go on and burst and get it over with, with briers and things grabbing at me, then I came onto the sand ditch where they had been",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,95,"and I recognised the tree where the car was, and just as I got out of the ditch and started running I heard the car start. It went off fast, blowing the horn. They kept on blowing it, like it was saying Yah. Yah. Yaaahhhhhhhh, going out of sight. I got to the road just in time to see it go out of sight. By the time I got up to where my car was, they were clean out of sight, the horn still blowing. Well, I never thought anything about it except I was saying Run. Run back to town. Run home and try to convince Mother that I never saw you in that car. Try to make her believe that I dont know who he was. Try to make her believe that I didn't miss ten feet of catching you in that ditch. Try to make her believe you were standing up, too. It kept on saying Yahhhhh, Yahhhhh, Yaaahhhhhhhhh, getting fainter and fainter. Then it quit, and I could hear a cow lowing up at Russell's barn. And still I never thought. I went up to the door and opened it and raised my foot. I kind of thought then that the car was leaning a little more than the slant of the road would be, but I never found it out until I got in and started off. Well, I just sat there. It was getting on toward sundown, and town was about five miles. They never even had guts enough to puncture it, to jab a hole in it. They just let the air out. I just stood there for a while, thinking about that kitchen full of niggers and not one of them had time to lift a tire onto the rack and screw up a couple of bolts. It was kind of funny because even she couldn't have seen far enough ahead to take the pump out on purpose, unless she thought about it while he was letting out the air maybe. But what it probably was was somebody took it out and gave it to Ben to play with for a squirt gun because they'd take the whole car to pieces if he wanted it and Dilsey says, Aint nobody teched yo car. What we want to fool with hit fer? and I says You're a nigger. You're lucky, do you know it? I says I'll swap with you any day because it takes a white man not to have anymore sense than to worry about what a little slut of a girl does. I walked up to Russell's. He had a pump. That was just an oversight on their part, I reckon. Only I still couldn't believe she'd have had the nerve to. I kept thinking that. I dont know why it is I cant seem to learn that a woman'll do anything. I kept thinking, Let's forget for a while how I feel toward you and how you feel toward me: I just wouldn't do you this way. I wouldn't do you this way no matter what you had done to me. Because like I say blood is blood and you cant get around it. It's not playing a joke that any eight year old boy could have thought of, it's letting your own uncle be laughed at by a man that would wear a red tie. They come into town and call us all a bunch of hicks and think it's too small to hold them. Well he doesn't know just how right he is. And her too. If that's the way she feels about it, she'd better keep right on going and a dam good riddance. I stopped and returned Russell's pump and drove on to town. I went to the drugstore and got a shot and then I went to the telegraph office. It had closed at 20.21, forty points down. Forty times five dollars; buy something with that if you can, and she'll say, I've got to have it I've just got to and I'll say that's too bad you'll have to try somebody else, I haven't got any money; I've been too busy to make any. I just looked at him. ""I'll tell you some news,"" I says. ""You'll be astonished to learn that I am interested in the cotton market,"" I says. ""That never occurred to you, did it?"" ""I did my best to deliver it,"" he says. ""I tried the store twice and called up your house, but they didn't know where you were,"" he says, digging in the drawer. ""Deliver what?"" I says. He handed me a telegram. ""What time did this come?"" I says. ""About half past three,"" he says. ""And now it's ten minutes past five,"" I says. ""I tried",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,96,"to deliver it,"" he says. ""I couldn't find you."" ""That's not my fault, is it?"" I says. I opened it, just to see what kind of a lie they'd tell me this time. They must be in one hell of a shape if they've got to come all the way to Mississippi to steal ten dollars a month. Sell, it says. The market will be unstable, with a general downward tendency. Do not be alarmed following government report. ""How much would a message like this cost?"" I says. He told me. ""They paid it,"" he says. ""Then I owe them that much,"" I says. ""I already knew this. Send this collect,"" I says, taking a blank. Buy, I wrote, Market just on point of blowing its head off. Occasional flurries for purpose of hooking a few more country suckers who haven't got in to the telegraph office yet. Do not be alarmed. ""Send that collect,"" I says. He looked at the message, then he looked at the clock. ""Market closed an hour ago,"" he says. ""Well,"" I says. ""That's not my fault either. I didn't invent it; I just bought a little of it while under the impression that the telegraph company would keep me informed as to what it was doing."" ""A report is posted whenever it comes in,"" he says. ""Yes,"" I says. ""And in Memphis they have it on a blackboard every ten seconds,"" I says. ""I was within sixty-seven miles of there once this afternoon."" He looked at the message. ""You want to send this?"" he says. ""I still haven't changed my mind,"" I says. I wrote the other one out and counted the money. ""And this one too, if you're sure you can spell b-u-y."" I went back to the store. I could hear the band from down the street. Prohibition's a fine thing. Used to be they'd come in Saturday with just one pair of shoes in the family and him wearing them, and they'd go down to the express office and get his package; now they all go to the show barefooted, with the merchants in the door like a row of tigers or something in a cage, watching them pass. Earl says, ""I hope it wasn't anything serious."" ""What?"" I says. He looked at his watch. Then he went to the door and looked at the courthouse clock. ""You ought to have a dollar watch,"" I says. ""It wont cost you so much to believe it's lying each time."" ""What?"" he says. ""Nothing,"" I says. ""Hope I haven't inconvenienced you."" ""We were not busy much,"" he says. ""They all went to the show. It's all right."" ""If it's not all right,"" I says, ""you know what you can do about it."" ""I said it was all right,"" he says. ""I heard you,"" I says. ""And if it's not all right, you know what you can do about it."" ""Do you want to quit?"" he says. ""It's not my business,"" I says. ""My wishes dont matter. But dont get the idea that you are protecting me by keeping me."" ""You'd be a good business man if you'd let yourself, Jason,"" he says. ""At least I can tend to my own business and let other people's alone,"" I says. ""I dont know why you are trying to make me fire you,"" he says. ""You know you could quit anytime and there wouldn't be any hard feelings between us."" ""Maybe that's why I dont quit,"" I says. ""As long as I tend to my job, that's what you are paying me for."" I went on to the back and got a drink of water and went on out to the back door. Job had the cultivators all set up at last. It was quiet there, and pretty soon my head got a little easier. I could hear them singing now, and then the band played again. Well, let them get every quarter and dime in the county; it was no skin off my back. I've done what I could; a man that can live as long as I have and not know when to quit is a fool. Especially as it's no business of mine. If it was my own daughter now it would be different, because she wouldn't have time to; she'd have to work some to feed a few invalids and idiots and niggers, because how could I have the face to bring anybody there. I've too much respect for anybody to do that. I'm a man, I can stand it, it's my own flesh and blood and I'd like to see the color of the man's eyes that would speak disrespectful of any woman that was my friend it's these dam good women that do it I'd like to see the good,",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,97,"church-going woman that's half as square as Lorraine, whore or no whore. Like I say if I was to get married you'd go up like a balloon and you know it and she says I want you to be happy to have a family of your own not to slave your life away for us. But I'll be gone soon and then you can take a wife but you'll never find a woman who is worthy of you and I says yes I could. You'd get right up out of your grave you know you would. I says no thank you I have all the women I can take care of now if I married a wife she'd probably turn out to be a hophead or something. That's all we lack in this family, I says. The sun was down beyond the Methodist church now, and the pigeons were flying back and forth around the steeple, and when the band stopped I could hear them cooing. It hadn't been four months since Christmas, and yet they were almost as thick as ever. I reckon Parson Walthall was getting a belly full of them now. You'd have thought we were shooting people, with him making speeches and even holding onto a man's gun when they came over. Talking about peace on earth good will toward all and not a sparrow can fall to earth. But what does he care how thick they get, he hasn't got anything to do: what does he care what time it is. He pays no taxes, he doesn't have to see his money going every year to have the courthouse clock cleaned to where it'll run. They had to pay a man forty-five dollars to clean it. I counted over a hundred half-hatched pigeons on the ground. You'd think they'd have sense enough to leave town. It's a good thing I dont have anymore ties than a pigeon, I'll say that. The band was playing again, a loud fast tune, like they were breaking up. I reckon they'd be satisfied now. Maybe they'd have enough music to entertain them while they drove fourteen or fifteen miles home and unharnessed in the dark and fed the stock and milked. All they'd have to do would be to whistle the music and tell the jokes to the live stock in the barn, and then they could count up how much they'd made by not taking the stock to the show too. They could figure that if a man had five children and seven mules, he cleared a quarter by taking his family to the show. Just like that. Earl came back with a couple of packages. ""Here's some more stuff going out,"" he says. ""Where's Uncle Job?"" ""Gone to the show, I imagine,"" I says. ""Unless you watched him."" ""He doesn't slip off,"" he says. ""I can depend on him. ""Meaning me by that,"" I says. He went to the door and looked out, listening. ""That's a good band,"" he says. ""It's about time they were breaking up, I'd say."" ""Unless they're going to spend the night there,"" I says. The swallows had begun, and I could hear the sparrows beginning to swarm in the trees in the courthouse yard. Every once in a while a bunch of them would come swirling around in sight above the roof, then go away. They are as big a nuisance as the pigeons, to my notion. You cant even sit in the courthouse yard for them. First thing you know, bing. Right on your hat. But it would take a millionaire to afford to shoot them at five cents a shot. If they'd just put a little poison out there in the square, they'd get rid of them in a day, because if a merchant cant keep his stock from running around the square, he'd better try to deal in something besides chickens, something that dont eat, like plows or onions. And if a man dont keep his dogs up, he either dont want it or he hasn't any business with one. Like I say if all the businesses in a town are run like country businesses, you're going to have a country town. ""It wont do you any good if they have broke up,"" I says. ""They'll have to hitch up and take out to get home by midnight as it is."" ""Well,"" he says. ""They enjoy it. Let them spend a little money on a show now and then. A hill farmer works pretty hard and gets mighty little for it."" ""There's no law making them farm in the hills,"" I says. ""Or anywhere else."" ""Where would you and me be, if it wasn't for the farmers?"" he says. ""I'd be home right now,"" I says. ""Lying down, with",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,98,"an ice pack on my head."" ""You have these headaches too often,"" he says. ""Why dont you have your teeth examined good? Did he go over them all this morning?"" ""Did who?"" I says. ""You said you went to the dentist this morning. ""Do you object to my having the headache on your time?"" I says. ""Is that it?"" They were crossing the alley now, coming up from the show. ""There they come,"" he says. ""I reckon I better get up front."" He went on. It's a curious thing how, no matter what's wrong with you, a man'll tell you to have your teeth examined and a woman'll tell you to get married. It always takes a man that never made much at any thing to tell you how to run your business, though. Like these college professors without a whole pair of socks to his name, telling you how to make a million in ten years, and a woman that couldn't even get a husband can always tell you how to raise a family. Old man Job came up with the wagon. After a while he got through wrapping the lines around the whip socket. ""Well,"" I says. ""Was it a good show?"" ""I aint been yit,"" he says. ""But I kin be arrested in dat tent tonight, dough."" ""Like hell you haven't,"" I says. ""You've been away from here since three oclock. Mr Earl was just back here looking for you."" ""I been tendin to my business,"" he says. ""Mr Earl knows whar I been."" ""You may can fool him,"" I says. ""I wont tell on you."" ""Den he's de onliest man here I'd try to fool,"" he says. ""Whut I want to waste my time foolin a man whut I dont keer whether I sees him Sat'dy night er not? I wont try to fool you,"" he says. ""You too smart fer me. Yes, suh,"" he says, looking busy as hell, putting five or six little packages into the wagon. ""You's too smart fer me. Aint a man in dis town kin keep up wid you fer smartness. You fools a man whut so smart he cant even keep up wid hisself,"" he says, getting in the wagon and unwrapping the reins. ""Who's that?"" I says. ""Dat's Mr Jason Compson,"" he says. ""Git up dar, Dan!"" One of the wheels was just about to come off. I watched to see if he'd get out of the alley before it did. Just turn any vehicle over to a nigger, though. I says that old rattletrap's just an eyesore, yet you'll keep it standing there in the carriage house a hundred years just so that boy can ride to the cemetery once a week. I says he's not the first fellow that'll have to do things he doesn't want to. I'd make him ride in that car like a civilised man or stay at home. What does he know about where he goes or what he goes in, and us keeping a carriage and a horse so he can take a ride on Sunday afternoon. A lot Job cared whether the wheel came off or not, long as he wouldn't have too far to walk back. Like I say the only place for them is in the field, where they'd have to work from sunup to sundown. They cant stand prosperity or an easy job. Let one stay around white people for a while and he's not worth killing. They get so they can outguess you about work before your very eyes, like Roskus the only mistake he ever made was he got careless one day and died. Shirking and stealing and giving you a little more lip and a little more lip until some day you have to lay them out with a scantling or something. Well, it's Earl's business. But I'd hate to have my business advertised over this town by an old doddering nigger and a wagon that you thought every time it turned a corner it would come all to pieces. The sun was all high up in the air now, and inside it was beginning to get dark. I went up front. The square was empty. Earl was back closing the safe, and then the clock begun to strike. ""You lock the back door?"" he says. I went back and locked it and came back. ""I suppose you're going to the show tonight,"" he says. ""I gave you those passes yesterday, didn't I?"" ""Yes,"" I says. ""You want them back?"" ""No, no,"" he says. ""I just forgot whether I gave them to you or not. No sense in wasting them."" He locked the door and said Goodnight and went on. The sparrows were still rattling away in the trees, but the square was empty",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no
sound-and-fury,99,"except for a few cars. There was a ford in front of the drugstore, but I didn't even look at it. I know when I've had enough of anything. I dont mind trying to help her, but I know when I've had enough. I guess I could teach Luster to drive it, then they could chase her all day long if they wanted to, and I could stay home and play with Ben. I went in and got a couple of cigars. Then I thought I'd have another headache shot for luck, and I stood and talked with them a while. ""Well,"" Mac says. ""I reckon you've got your money on the Yankees this year."" ""What for?"" I says. ""The Pennant,"" he says. ""Not anything in the league can beat them."" ""Like hell there's not,"" I says. ""They're shot,"" I says. ""You think a team can be that lucky forever?"" ""I dont call it luck,"" Mac says. ""I wouldn't bet on any team that fellow Ruth played on,"" I says. ""Even if I knew it was going to win."" ""Yes?"" Mac says. ""I can name you a dozen men in either league who're more valuable than he is,"" I says. ""What have you got against Ruth?"" Mac says. ""Nothing,"" I says. ""I haven't got any thing against him. I dont even like to look at his picture."" I went on out. The lights were coming on, and people going along the streets toward home. Sometimes the sparrows never got still until full dark. The night they turned on the new lights around the courthouse it waked them up and they were flying around and blundering into the lights all night long. They kept it up two or three nights, then one morning they were all gone. Then after about two months they all came back again. I drove on home. There were no lights in the house yet, but they'd all be looking out the windows, and Dilsey jawing away in the kitchen like it was her own food she was having to keep hot until I got there. You'd think to hear her that there wasn't but one supper in the world, and that was the one she had to keep back a few minutes on my account. Well at least I could come home one time without finding Ben and that nigger hanging on the gate like a bear and a monkey in the same cage. Just let it come toward sundown and he'd head for the gate like a cow for the barn, hanging onto it and bobbing his head and sort of moaning to himself. That's a hog for punishment for you. If what had happened to him for fooling with open gates had happened to me, I never would want to see another one. I often wondered what he'd be thinking about, down there at the gate, watching the girls going home from school, trying to want something he couldn't even remember he didn't and couldn't want any longer. And what he'd think when they'd be undressing him and he'd happen to take a look at himself and begin to cry like he'd do. But like I say they never did enough of that. I says I know what you need you need what they did to Ben then you'd behave. And if you dont know what that was I says, ask Dilsey to tell you. There was a light in Mother's room. I put the car up and went on into the kitchen. Luster and Ben were there. ""Where's Dilsey?"" I says. ""Putting supper on?"" ""She up stairs wid Miss Cahline,"" Luster says. ""Dey been goin hit. Ever since Miss Quentin come home. Mammy up there keepin um fum fightin. Is dat show come, Mr Jason?"" ""Yes,"" I says. I thought I heard de band,"" he says. ""Wish I could go,"" he says. ""I could ef I jes had a quarter."" Dilsey came in. ""You come, is you?"" she says. ""Whut you been up to dis evenin? You knows how much work I got to do; whyn't you git here on time?"" ""Maybe I went to the show,"" I says. ""Is supper ready?"" ""Wish I could go,"" Luster says. ""I could ef I jes had a quarter."" ""You aint got no business at no show,"" Dilsey says. ""You go on in de house and set down,"" she says. ""dont you go up stairs and git um started again, now."" ""What's the matter?"" I says. ""Quentin come in a while ago and says you been follerin her around all evenin and den Miss Cahline jumped on her. Whyn't you let her alone? Cant you live in de same house wid yo own blood niece widout quoilin?"" ""I cant quarrel with her,"" I says, ""because I",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,100,"haven't seen her since this morning. What does she say I've done now? made her go to school? That's pretty bad,"" I says. ""Well, you tend to yo business and let her lone,"" Dilsey says. ""I'll take keer of her ef you'n Miss Cahline'll let me. Go on in afar now and behave yoself swell I git supper on."" ""Ef I jes had a quarter,"" Luster says, ""I could go to dat show."" ""En ef you had wings you could fly to heaven,"" Dilsey says. ""I dont want to hear another word about dat show."" ""That reminds me,"" I says. ""I've got a couple of tickets they gave me."" I took them out of my coat. ""You fixin to use um?"" Luster says. ""Not me,"" I says. ""I wouldn't go to it for ten dollars."" ""Gimme one of um, Mr Jason,"" he says. ""I'll sell you one,"" I says. ""How about it?"" ""I aint got no money,"" he says. ""That's too bad,"" I says. I made to go out. ""Gimme one of um, Mr Jason,"" he says. ""You aint gwine need um bofe."" ""Hush yo motif,"" Dilsey says. ""dont you know he aint gwine give nothin away?"" ""How much you want fer hit?"" he says. ""Five cents,"" I says. ""I aint got dat much,"" he says. ""How much you got?"" I says. ""I aint got nothin,"" he says. ""All right,"" I says. I went on. ""Mr Jason,"" he says. ""Whyn't you hush up?"" Dilsey says. ""He jes teasin you. He fixin to use dem tickets hisself. Go on, Jason, and let him lone."" ""I dont want them,"" I says. I came back to the stove. ""I came in here to burn them up. But if you want to buy one for a nickel?"" I says, looking at him and opening the stove lid. ""I aint got dat much,"" he says. ""All right,"" I says. I dropped one of them in the stove. ""You, Jason,"" Dilsey says. ""Aint you shamed?"" ""Mr Jason,"" he says. ""Please, suh. I'll fix dem tires ev'y day fer a mont."" ""I need the cash,"" I says. ""You can have it for a nickel."" ""Hush, Luster,"" Dilsey says. She jerked him back. ""Go on,"" she says. ""Drop hit in. Go on. Git hit over with."" ""You can have it for a nickel,"" I says. ""Go on,"" Dilsey says. ""He aint got no nickel. Go on. Drop hit in."" ""All right,"" I says. I dropped it in and Dilsey shut the stove. ""A big growed man like you,"" she says. ""Git on outen my kitchen. Hush,"" she says to Luster. ""Dont you git Benjy started. I'll git you a quarter fum Frony tonight and you kin go tomorrow night. Hush up, now."" I went on into the living room. I couldn't hear anything from upstairs. I opened the paper. After a while Ben and Luster came in. Ben went to the dark place on the wall where the mirror used to be, rubbing his hands on it and slobbering and moaning. Luster begun punching at the fire. ""What're you doing?"" I says. ""We dont need any fire tonight."" ""I tryin to keep him quiet,"" he says. ""Hit always cold Easter,"" he says. ""Only this is not Easter,"" I says. ""Let it alone."" He put the poker back and got the cushion out of Mother's chair and gave it to Ben, and he hunkered down in front of the fireplace and got quiet. I read the paper. There hadn't been a sound from upstairs when Dilsey came in and sent Ben and Luster on to the kitchen and said supper was ready. ""All right,"" I says. She went out. I sat there, reading the paper. After a while I heard Dilsey looking in at the door. ""Whyn't you come on and eat?"" she says. ""I'm waiting for supper,"" I says. ""Hit's on the table,"" she says. ""I done told you."" ""Is it?"" I says. ""Excuse me. I didn't hear anybody come down."" ""They aint comin,"" she says. ""You come on and eat, so I can take something up to them."" ""Are they sick?"" I says. ""What did the doctor say it was? Not Smallpox, I hope."" ""Come on here, Jason,"" she says. ""So I kin git done."" ""All right,"" I says, raising the paper again. ""I'm waiting for supper now."" I could feel her watching me at the door. I read the paper. ""Whut you want to act like this fer?"" she says. ""When you knows how much bother I has anyway."" ""If Mother is any sicker than she was when she came down to dinner, all right,"" I says. ""But as long as I am buying come down to the table to eat it. Let me know when supper's ready,"" I says, reading the paper again. I heard",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no
sound-and-fury,101,"her climbing the stairs, dragging her feet and grunting and groaning like they were straight up and three feet apart. I heard her at Mother's door, then I heard her calling Quentin, like the door was locked, then she went back to Mother's room and then Mother went and talked to Quentin. Then they came down stairs. I read the paper. Dilsey came back to the door. ""Come on,"" she says, ""fo you kin think up some mo devilment. You just tryin yoself tonight."" I went to the diningroom. Quentin was sitting with her head bent. She had painted her face again. Her nose looked like a porcelain insulator. ""I'm glad you feel well enough to come down,"" I says to Mother. ""It's little enough I can do for you, to come to the table,"" she says. ""No matter how I feel. I realise that when a man works all day he likes to be surrounded by his family at the supper table. I want to please you. I only wish you and Quentin got along better. It would be easier for me."" ""We get along all right,"" I says. ""I dont mind her staying locked up in her room all day if she wants to. But I cant have all this whoop-de-do and sulking at mealtimes. I know that's a lot to ask her, but I'm that way in my own house. Your house, I meant to say."" ""It's yours,"" Mother says. ""You are the head of it now."" Quentin hadn't looked up. I helped the plates and she begun to eat. ""Did you get a good piece of meat?"" I says. ""If you didn't, I'll try to find you a better one."" She didn't say anything. ""I say, did you get a good piece of meat?"" I says. ""What?"" she says. ""Yes. It's all right."" ""Will you have some more rice?"" I says. ""No,"" she says. ""Better let me give you some more,"" I says. ""I dont want any more,"" she says. ""Not at all,"" I says. ""You're welcome."" ""Is your headache gone?"" Mother says. ""Headache?"" I says. ""I was afraid you were developing one,"" she says. ""When you came in this afternoon."" ""Oh,"" I says. ""No, it didn't show up. We stayed so busy this afternoon I forgot about it."" ""Was that why you were late?"" Mother says. I could see Quentin listening. I looked at her. Her knife and fork were still going, but I caught her looking at me, then she looked at her plate again. I says, ""No. I loaned my car to a fellow about three oclock and I had to wait until he got back with it."" I ate for a while. ""Who was it?"" Mother says. ""It was one of those show men,"" I says. ""It seems his sister's husband was out riding with some town woman, and he was chasing them."" Quentin sat perfectly still, chewing. ""You ought not to lend your car to people like that,"" Mother says. ""You are too generous with it. That's why I never call on you for it if I can help it."" ""I was beginning to think that myself, for a while,"" I says. ""But he got back, all right. He says he found what he was looking for."" ""Who was the woman?"" Mother says. ""I'll tell you later,"" I says. ""I dont like to talk about such things before Quentin."" Quentin had quit eating. Every once in a while she'd take a drink of water, then she'd sit there crumbling a biscuit up, her face bent over her plate. ""Yes,"" Mother says. ""I suppose women who stay shut up like I do have no idea what goes on in this town."" ""Yes,"" I says. ""They dont."" ""My life has been so different from that,"" Mother says. ""Thank God I dont know about such wickedness. I dont even want to know about it. I'm not like most people."" I didn't say any more. Quentin sat there, crumbling the biscuit until I quit eating. Then she says, ""Can I go now?"" without looking at anybody. ""What?"" I says. ""Sure, you can go. Were you waiting on us?"" She looked at me. She had crumpled all the bread, but her hands still went on like they were crumpling it yet and her eyes looked like they were cornered or something and then she started biting her mouth like it ought to have poisoned her, with all that red lead. ""Grandmother,"" she says. ""Grandmother--"" ""Did you want something else to eat?"" I says. ""Why does he treat me like this, Grandmother?"" she says. ""I never hurt him."" ""I want you all to get along with one another,"" Mother says. ""You are all that's left now, and I do want you all to get along better."" ""It's",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,102,"his fault,"" she says. ""He wont let me alone, and I have to. If he doesn't want me here, why wont he let me go back to--"" ""That's enough,"" I says. ""Not another word."" ""Then why wont he let me alone?"" she says. ""He--he just--"" ""He is the nearest thing to a father you've ever had,"" Mother says. ""It's his bread you and I eat. It's only right that he should expect obedience from you."" ""It's his fault,"" she says. She jumped up. ""He makes me do it. If he would just--"" she looked at us, her eyes cornered, kind of jerking her arms against her sides. ""If I would just what?"" I says. ""Whatever I do, it's your fault,"" she says. ""If I'm bad, it's because I had to be. You made me. I wish I was dead. I wish we were all dead."" Then she ran. We heard her run up the stairs. Then a door slammed. ""That's the first sensible thing she ever said,"" I says. ""She didn't go to school today,"" Mother says. ""How do you know?"" I says. ""Were you down town?"" ""I just know,"" she says. ""I wish you could be kinder to her."" ""If I did that I'd have to arrange to see her more than once a day,"" I says. ""You'll have to make her come to the table every meal. Then I could give her an extra piece of meat every time."" ""There are little things you could do,"" she says. ""Like not paying any attention when you ask me to see that she goes to school?"" I says. ""She didn't go to school today,"" she says. ""I just know she didn't. She says she went for a car ride with one of the boys this afternoon and you followed her."" ""How could I,"" I says. ""When somebody had my car all afternoon? Whether or not she was in school today is already past,"" I says. ""If you've got to worry about it, worry about next Monday."" ""I wanted you and she to get along with one another,"" she says. ""But she has inherited all of the headstrong traits. Quentin's too. I thought at the time, with the heritage she would already have, to give her that name, too. Sometimes I think she is the judgment of both of them upon me."" ""Good Lord,"" I says. ""You've got a fine mind. No wonder you keep yourself sick all the time."" ""What?"" she says. ""I dont understand."" ""I hope not,"" I says. ""A good woman misses a lot she's better off without knowing."" ""They were both that way,"" she says. ""They would make interest with your father against me when I tried to correct them. He was always saying they didn't need controlling, that they already knew what cleanliness and honesty were, which was all that anyone could hope to be taught. And now I hope he's satisfied."" ""You've got Ben to depend on,"" I says. ""Cheer up."" ""They deliberately shut me out of their lives,"" she says. ""It was always her and Quentin. They were always conspiring against me. Against you too, though you were too young to realise it. They always looked on you and me as outsiders, like they did your Uncle Maury. I always told your father that they were allowed too much freedom, to be together too much. When Quentin started to school we had to let her go the next year, so she could be with him. She couldn't bear for any of you to do anything she couldn't. It was vanity in her, vanity and false pride. And then when her troubles began I knew that Quentin would feel that he had to do something just as bad. But I didn't believe that he would have been so selfish as to-I didn't dream that he--"" ""Maybe he knew it was going to be a girl,"" I says. ""And that one more of them would be more than he could stand."" ""He could have controlled her,"" she says. ""He seemed to be the only person she had any consideration for. But that is a part of the judgment too, I suppose."" ""Yes,"" I says. ""Too bad it wasn't me instead of him. You'd be a lot better off."" ""You say things like that to hurt me,"" she says. ""I deserve it though. When they began to sell the land to send Quentin to Harvard I told your father that he must make an equal provision for you. Then when Herbert offered to take you into the bank I said, Jason is provided for now, and when all the expense began to pile up and I was forced to sell our furniture and the rest of the pasture, I wrote her at once because I said she",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,103,"will realise that she and Quentin have had their share and part of Jason's too and that it depends on her now to compensate him. I said she will do that out of respect for her father. I believed that, then. But I'm just a poor old woman; I was raised to believe that people would deny themselves for their own flesh and blood. It's my fault. You were right to reproach me."" ""Do you think I need any man's help to stand on my feet?"" I says. ""Let alone a woman that cant name the father of her own child."" ""Jason,"" she says. ""All right,"" I says. ""I didn't mean that. Of course not."" ""If I believed that were possible, after all my suffering."" ""Of course it's not,"" I says. ""I didn't mean it."" ""I hope that at least is spared me,"" she says. ""Sure it is,"" I says. ""She's too much like both of them to doubt that."" ""I couldn't bear that,"" she says. ""Then quit thinking about it,"" I says. ""Has she been worrying you any more about getting out at night?"" ""No. I made her realise that it was for her own good and that she'd thank me for it some day. She takes her books with her and studies after I lock the door. I see the light on as late as eleven oclock some nights."" ""How do you know she's studying?"" I says. ""I dont know what else she'd do in there alone,"" she says. ""She never did read any."" ""No,"" I says. ""You wouldn't know. And you can thank your stars for that,"" I says. Only what would be the use in saying it aloud. It would just have her crying on me again. I heard her go up stairs. Then she called Quentin and Quentin says What? through the door. ""Goodnight,"" Mother says. Then I heard the key in the lock, and Mother went back to her room. When I finished my cigar and went up, the light was still on. I could see the empty keyhole, but I couldn't hear a sound. She studied quiet. Maybe she learned that in school. I told Mother goodnight and went on to my room and got the box out and counted it again. I could hear the Great American Gelding snoring away like a planing mill. I read somewhere they'd fix men that way to give them women's voices. But maybe he didn't know what they'd done to him. I dont reckon he even knew what he had been trying to do, or why Mr Burgess knocked him out with the fence picket. And if they'd just sent him on to Jackson while he was under the ether, he'd never have known the difference. But that would have been too simple for a Compson to think of. Not half complex enough. Having to wait to do it at all until he broke out and tried to run a little girl down on the street with her own father looking at him. Well, like I say they never started soon enough with their cutting, and they quit too quick. I know at least two more that needed something like that, and one of them not over a mile away, either. But then I dont reckon even that would do any good. Like I say once a bitch always a bitch. And just let me have twenty-four hours without any dam New York jew to advise me what it's going to do. I don't want to make a killing; save that to suck in the smart gamblers with. I just want an even chance to get my money back. And once I've done that they can bring all Beale street and all bedlam in here and two of them can sleep in my bed and another one can have my place at the table too. April 8, 1928 The day dawned bleak and chill, a moving wall of gray light out of the northeast which, instead of dissolving into moisture, seemed to disintegrate into minute and venomous particles, like dust that, when Dilsey opened the door of the cabin and emerged, needled laterally into her flesh, precipitating not so much a moisture as a substance partaking of the quality of thin, not quite congealed oil. She wore a stiff black straw hat perched upon her turban, and a maroon velvet cape with a border of mangy and anonymous fur above a dress of purple silk, and she stood in the door for a while with her myriad and sunken face lifted to the weather, and one gaunt hand flac-soled as the belly of a fish, then she moved the cape aside and examined the bosom of her gown. The gown fell gauntly from her shoulders, across",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,104,"her fallen breasts, then tightened upon her paunch and fell again, ballooning a little above the nether garments which she would remove layer by layer as the spring accomplished and the warm days, in color regal and moribund. She had been a big woman once but now her skeleton rose, draped loosely in unpadded skin that tightened again upon a paunch almost dropsical, as though muscle and tissue had been courage or fortitude which the days or the years had consumed until only the indomitable skeleton was left rising like a ruin or a landmark above the somnolent and impervious guts, and above that the collapsed face that gave the impression of the bones themselves being outside the flesh, lifted into the driving day with an expression at once fatalistic and of a child's astonished disappointment, until she turned and entered the house again and closed the door. The earth immediately about the door was bare. It had a patina, as though from the soles of bare feet in generations, like old silver or the walls of Mexican houses which have been plastered by hand. Beside the house, shading it in summer, stood three mulberry trees, the fledged leaves that would later be broad and placid as the palms of hands streaming flatly undulant upon the driving air. A pair of jaybirds came up from nowhere, whirled up on the blast like gaudy scraps of cloth or paper and lodged in the mulberries, where they swung in raucous tilt and recover, screaming into the wind that ripped their harsh cries onward and away like scraps of paper or of cloth in turn. Then three more joined them and they swung and tilted in the wrung branches for a time, screaming. The door of the cabin opened and Dilsey emerged once more, this time in a man's felt hat and an army overcoat, beneath the frayed skirts of which her blue gingham dress fell in uneven balloonings, streaming too about her as she crossed the yard and mounted the steps to the kitchen door. A moment later she emerged, carrying an open umbrella now, which she slanted ahead into the wind, and crossed to the woodpile and laid the umbrella down, still open. Immediately she caught at it and arrested it and held to it for a while, looking about her. Then she closed it and laid it down and stacked stovewood into her crooked arm, against her breast, and picked up the umbrella and got it open at last and returned to the steps and held the wood precariously balanced while she contrived to close the umbrella, which she propped in the corner just within the door. She dumped the wood into the box behind the stove. Then she removed the overcoat and hat and took a soiled apron down from the wall and put it on and built a fire in the stove. While she was doing so, rattling the grate bars and clattering the lids, Mrs Compson began to call her from the head of the stairs. She wore a dressing gown of quilted black satin, holding it close under her chin. In the other hand she held a red rubber hot water bottle and she stood at the head of the back stairway, calling ""Dilsey"" at steady and inflectionless intervals into the quiet stairwell that descended into complete darkness, then opened again where a gray window fell across it. ""Dilsey,"" she called, without inflection or emphasis or haste, as though she were not listening for a reply at all. ""Dilsey."" Dilsey answered and ceased clattering the stove, but before she could cross the kitchen Mrs Compson called her again, and before she crossed the diningroom and brought her head into relief against the gray splash of the window, still again. ""All right,"" Dilsey said. ""All right, here I is. I'll fill hit soon ez I git some hot water."" She gathered up her skirts and mounted the stairs, wholly blotting the gray light. ""Put hit down dar en g'awn back to bed."" ""I couldn't understand what was the matter,"" Mrs Compson said. ""I've been lying awake for an hour at least, without hearing a sound from the kitchen."" ""You put hit down and g'awn back to bed,"" Dilsey said. She toiled painfully up the steps, shapeless, breathing heavily. ""I'll have de fire gwine in a minute, en de water hot in two mot"" ""I've been lying there for an hour, at least,"" Mrs Compson said. ""I thought maybe you were waiting for me to come down and start the fire."" Dilsey reached the top of the stairs and took the water bottle. ""I'll fix hit in a minute,"" she said. ""Luster overslep dis mawnin, up half de night at dat show. I gwine build de fire myself.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,105,"Go on now, so you wont wake de others swell I ready."" ""If you permit Luster to do things that interfere with his work, you'll have to suffer for it yourself,"" Mrs Compson said. ""Jason wont like this if he hears about it. You know he wont."" ""'Twusn't none of Jason's money he went on,"" Dilsey said. ""Dat's one thing shot"" She went on down the stairs. Mrs Compson returned to her room. As she got into bed again she could hear Dilsey yet descending the stairs with a sort of painful and terrific slowness that would have become maddening had it not presently ceased beyond the flapping diminishment of the pantry door. She entered the kitchen and built up the fire and began to prepare breakfast. In the midst of this she ceased and went to the window and looked out toward her cabin, then she went to the door and opened it and shouted into the driving weather. ""Luster!"" she shouted, standing to listen, tilting her face from the wind. ""You, Luster!"" She listened, then as she prepared to shout again Luster appeared around the corner of the kitchen. ""Ma'am?"" he said innocently, so innocently that Dilsey looked down at him, for a moment motionless, with something more than mere surprise. ""Whar you at?"" she said. ""Nowhere,"" he said. ""Jes in de cellar."" ""Whut you coin in de cellar?"" she said. ""Dont stand dar in de rain, fool,"" she said. ""Aint coin nothin,"" he said. He came up the steps. ""Dont you dare come in dis do widout a armful of wood,"" she said. ""Here I done had to tote yo wood en build yo fire bofe. Didn't I tole you not to leave dis place last night befo dat woodbox wus full to de top?"" ""I did,"" Luster said. ""I filled hit."" ""Whar hit gone to, den?"" ""I dont know'm. I aint teched hit."" ""Well, you git hit full up now,"" she said. ""And git on up dar en see bout Benjy."" She shut the door. Luster went to the woodpile. The five jaybirds whirled over the house, screaming, and into the mulberries again. He watched them. He picked up a rock and threw it. ""Whoo,"" he said. ""Git on back to hell, whar you belong at. 'Taint Monday yit."" He loaded himself mountainously with stove wood. He could not see over it, and he staggered to the steps and up them and blundered crashing against the door, shedding billets. Then Dilsey came and opened the door for him and he blundered across the kitchen. ""You, Luster!""Hah!"""" she shouted, but he had already hurled the wood into the box with a thunderous crash. ""Hah!"" he said. ""Is you tryin to wake up de whole house?"" Dilsey said. She hit him on the back of his head with the flat of her hand. ""Go on up dar and git Benjy dressed, now."" ""Yessum,"" he said. He went toward the outer door. ""Whar you gwine Dilsey said. ""I thought I better go round de house en in by de front, so I wont wake up Miss Cahline en dem."" ""You go on up dem back stairs like I tole you en git Benjy's clothes on him,"" Dilsey said. ""Go on, now."" ""Yessum,"" Luster said. He returned and left by the diningroom door. After a while it ceased to flap. Dilsey prepared to make biscuit. As she ground the sifter steadily above the bread board, she sang, to herself at first, something without particular tune or words, repetitive, mournful and plaintive, austere, as she ground a faint, steady snowing of flour onto the bread board. The stove had begun to heat the room and to fill it with murmurous minors of the fire, and presently she was singing louder, as if her voice too had been thawed out by the growing warmth, and then Mrs Compson called her name again from within the house. Dilsey raised her face as if her eyes could and did penetrate the walls and ceiling and saw the old woman in her quilted dressing gown at the head of the stairs, calling her name with machinelike regularity. ""Oh, Lawd,"" Dilsey said. She set the sifter down and swept up the hem of her apron and wiped her hands and caught up the bottle from the chair on which she had laid it and gathered her apron about the handle of the kettle which was now jetting faintly. ""Jes a minute,"" she called. ""De water jes dis minute got hot."" It was not the bottle which Mrs Compson wanted, however, and clutching it by the neck like a dead hen Dilsey went to the foot of the stairs and looked upward. ""Aint Luster up dar wid him?"" she said. ""Luster hasn't been in the house. I've",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,106,"been lying here listening for him. I knew he would be late, but I did hope he'd come in time to keep Benjamin from disturbing Jason on Jason's one day in the week to sleep in the morning."" ""I dont see how you expect anybody to sleep, wid you standin in de hall, holl'in at folks fum de crack of dawn,"" Dilsey said. She began to mount the stairs, toiling heavily. ""I sent dat boy up dar half an hour ago."" Mrs Compson watched her, holding the dressing gown under her chin. ""What are you going to do?"" she said. ""Gwine git Benjy dressed en bring him down to de kitchen, whar he wont wake Jason en Quentin,"" Dilsey said. ""Haven't you started breakfast yet?"" ""I'll tend to dat too,"" Dilsey said. ""You better git back in bed swell Luster make yo fire. Hit cold dis mawnin."" ""I know it,"" Mrs Compson said. ""My feet are like ice. They were so cold they waked me up."" She watched Dilsey mount the stairs. It took her a long while. ""You know how it frets Jason when breakfast is late,"" Mrs Compson said. ""I cant do but one thing at a time,"" Dilsey said. ""You git on back to bed, fo I has you on my hands dis mawnin too."" ""If you're going to drop everything to dress Benjamin, I'd better come down and get breakfast. You know as well as I do how Jason acts when it's late."" ""En who gwine eat yo messin?"" Dilsey said. ""Tell me dat. Go on now,"" she said, toiling upward. Mrs Compson stood watching her as she mounted, steadying herself against the wall with one hand, holding her skirts up with the other. ""Are you going to wake him up just to dress him?"" she said. Dilsey stopped. With her foot lifted to the next step she stood there, her hand against the wall and the gray splash of the window behind her, motionless and shapeless she loomed. ""He aint awake den?"" she said. ""He wasn't when I looked in,"" Mrs Compson said. ""But it's past his time. He never does sleep after half past seven. You know he doesn't."" Dilsey said nothing. She made no further move, but though she could not see her save as a blobby shape without depth, Mrs Compson knew that she had lowered her face a little and that she stood now like cows do in the rain, holding the empty water bottle by its neck. ""You're not the one who has to bear it,"" Mrs Compson said. ""It's not your responsibility. You can go away. You dont have to bear the brunt of it day in and day out. You owe nothing to them, to Mr Compson's memory. I know you have never had any tenderness for Jason. You've never tried to conceal it."" Dilsey said nothing. She turned slowly and descended, lowering her body from step to step, as a small child does, her hand against the wall. ""You go on and let him alone,"" she said. ""Dont go in dar no mo, now. I'll send Luster up soon as I find him. Let him alone, now."" She returned to the kitchen. She looked into the stove, then she drew her apron over her head and donned the overcoat and opened the outer door and looked up and down the yard. The weather drove upon her flesh, harsh and minute, but the scene was empty of all else that moved. She descended the steps, gingerly, as if for silence, and went around the corner of the kitchen. As she did so Luster emerged quickly and innocently from the cellar door. Dilsey stopped. ""Whut you up to?"" she said. ""Nothin,"" Luster said. ""Mr Jason say fer me to find out whar dat water leak in de cellar fum."" ""En when wus hit he say fer you to do dat?"" Dilsey said. ""Last New Year's day, wasn't hit?"" ""I thought I jes be lookin whiles dey sleep,"" Luster said. Dilsey went to the cellar door. He stood aside and she peered down into the obscurity odorous of dank earth and mold and rubber. ""Huh,"" Dilsey said. She looked at Luster again. He met her gaze blandly, innocent and open. ""I dont know whut you up to, but you aint got no business coin hit. You jes tryin me too dis mawnin cause de others is, aint you? You git on up dar en see to Benjy, you hear?"" ""Yessum,"" Luster said. He went on toward the kitchen steps, swiftly. ""Here,"" Dilsey said. ""You git me another armful of wood while I got you."" ""Yessum,"" he said. He passed her on the steps and went to the woodpile. When he blundered again at the door a moment later, again invisible",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
sound-and-fury,107,"and blind within and beyond his wooden avatar, Dilsey opened the door and guided him across the kitchen with a firm hand. ""Jes thow hit at dat box again,"" she said. ""Jes thow hit."" ""I got to,"" Luster said, panting. ""I cant put hit down no other way."" ""Den you stand dar en hold hit a while,"" Dilsey said. She unloaded him a stick at a time. ""Whut got into you dis mawnin? Here I vent you fer wood en you aint never brought mo'n six sticks at a time to save yo life swell today. Whut you fixin to ax me kin you do now? Aint dat show lef town yit?"" ""Yessum. Hit done gone."" She put the last stick into the box. ""Now you go on up dar wid Benjy, like I tole you befo,"" she said. ""And I dont want nobody else yellin down dem stairs at me swell I rings de bell. You hear me."" ""Yessum,"" Luster said. He vanished through the swing door. Dilsey put some more wood in the stove and returned to the bread board. Presently she began to sing again. The room grew warmer. Soon Dilsey's skin had taken on a rich, lustrous quality as compared with that as of a faint dusting of wood ashes which both it and Luster's had worn as she moved about the kitchen, gathering about her the raw materials of food, coordinating the meal. On the wall above a cupboard, invisible save at night, by lamp light and even then evincing an enigmatic profundity because it had but one hand, a cabinet clock ticked, then with a preliminary sound as if it had cleared its throat, struck five times. ""Eight oclock,"" Dilsey said. She ceased and tilted her head upward, listening. But there was no sound save the clock and the fire. She opened the oven and looked at the pan of bread, then stooping she paused while someone descended the stairs. She heard the feet cross the diningroom, then the swing door opened and Luster entered, followed by a big man who appeared to have been shaped of some substance whose particles would not or did not cohere to one another or to the frame which supported it. His skin was dead looking and hairless; dropsical too, he moved with a shambling gait like a trained bear. His hair was pale and fine. It had been brushed smoothly down upon his brow like that of children in daguerrotypes. His eyes were clear, of the pale sweet blue of cornflowers, his thick mouth hung open, drooling a little. ""Is he cold?"" Dilsey said. She wiped her hands on her apron and touched his hand. ""Ef he aint, I is,"" Luster said. ""Always cold Easter. Aint never seen hit fail. Miss Cahline say ef you aint got time to fix her hot water bottle to never mind about hit."" ""Oh, Lawd,"" Dilsey said. She drew a chair into the corner between the woodbox and the stove. The man went obediently and sat in it. ""Look in de dinin room and see whar I laid dat bottle down,"" Dilsey said. Luster fetched the bottle from the diningroom and Dilsey filled it and gave it to him. ""Hurry up, now,"" she said. ""See ef Jason wake now. Tell em hit's all ready."" Luster went out. Ben sat beside the stove. He sat loosely, utterly motionless save for his head, which made a continual bobbing sort of movement as he watched Dilsey with his sweet vague gaze as she moved about. Luster returned. ""He up,"" he said. ""Miss Cahline say put hit on de table."" He came to the stove and spread his hands palm down above the firebox. ""He up, too,"" he said. ""Gwine hit wid bofe feet dis mawnin."" ""Whut's de matter now?"" Dilsey said. ""Git away fum dar. How kin I do anything wid you standin over de stove?"" ""I cold,"" Luster said. ""You ought to thought about dat whiles you was down dar in dat cellar,"" Dilsey said. ""Whut de matter wid Jason?"" ""Sayin me en Benjy broke dat winder in his room."" ""Is dey one broke?"" Dilsey said. ""Dat's whut he sayin,"" Luster said. ""Say I broke hit."" ""How could you, when he keep hit locked all day en night?"" ""Say I broke hit chunkin rocks at hit,"" Luster said. ""En did you?"" ""Nome,"" Luster said. ""Dont lie to me, boy,"" Dilsey said. ""I never done hit,"" Luster said. ""Ask Benjy ef I did. I aint stud'in dat winder."" ""Who could a broke hit, den?"" Dilsey said. ""He jes tryin hisself, to wake Quentin up,"" she said, taking the pan of biscuits out of the stove. ""Reckin so,"" Luster said. ""Dese funny folks. Glad I aint none of em."" ""Aint none of who?"" Dilsey said.",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,108,"""Lemme tell you somethin, nigger boy, you got jes es much Compson devilment in you es any of em. Is you right sho you never broke dat window?"" ""Whut I want to break hit fur?"" ""Whut you do any of yo devilment fur?"" Dilsey said. ""Watch him now, so he cant burn his hand again swell I git de table set."" She went to the diningroom, where they heard her moving about, then she returned and set a plate at the kitchen table and set food there. Ben watched her, slobbering, making a faint, eager sound. ""All right, honey,"" she said. ""Here yo breakfast. Bring his chair, Luster."" Luster moved the chair up and Ben sat down, whimpering and slobbering. Dilsey tied a cloth about his neck and wiped his mouth with the end of it. ""And see kin you keep fum messin up his clothes one time,"" she said, handing Luster a spoon. Ben ceased whimpering. He watched the spoon as it rose to his mouth. It was as if even eagerness were musclebound in him too, and hunger itself inarticulate, not knowing it is hunger. Luster fed him with skill and detachment. Now and then his attention would return long enough to enable him to feint the spoon and cause Ben to close his mouth upon the empty air, but it was apparent that Luster's mind was elsewhere. His other hand lay on the back of the chair and upon that dead surface it moved tentatively, delicately, as if he were picking an inaudible tune out of the dead void, and once he even forgot to tease Ben with the spoon while his fingers teased out of the slain wood a soundless and involved arpeggio until Ben recalled him by whimpering again. In the diningroom Dilsey moved back and forth. Presently she rang a small clear bell, then in the kitchen Luster heard Mrs Compson and Jason descending, and Jason's voice, and he rolled his eyes whitely with listening. ""Sure, I know they didn't break it,"" Jason said. ""Sure, I know that. Maybe the change of weather broke it."" ""I dont see how it could have,"" Mrs Compson said. ""Your room stays locked all day long, just as you leave it when you go to town. None of us ever go in there except Sunday, to clean it. I dont want you to think that I would go where I'm not wanted, or that I would permit anyone else to."" ""I never said you broke it, did I?"" Jason said. ""I dont want to go in your room,"" Mrs Compson said. ""I respect anybody's private affairs. I wouldn't put my foot over the threshold, even if I had a key."" ""Yes,"" Jason said. ""I know your keys wont fit. That's why I had the lock changed. What I want to know is, how that window got broken."" ""Luster say he didn't do hit,"" Dilsey said. ""I knew that without asking him,"" Jason said. ""Where's Quentin?"" he said. ""Where she is ev'y Sunday mawnin,"" Dilsey said. ""Whut got into you de last few days, anyhow?"" ""Well, we're going to change all that,"" Jason said. ""Go up and tell her breakfast is ready."" ""You leave her alone now, Jason,"" Dilsey said. ""She gits up fer breakfast ev'y week mawnin, en Miss Cahline lets her stay in bed ev'y Sunday. You knows dat."" ""I cant keep a kitchen full of niggers to wait on her pleasure, much as I'd like to,"" Jason said. ""Go and tell her to come down to breakfast."" ""Aint nobody have to wait on her,"" Dilsey said. ""I puts her breakfast in de warmer en she--"" ""Did you hear me?"" Jason said. ""I hears you,"" Dilsey said. ""All I been hearin, when you in de house. Ef hit aint Quentin er yo maw, hit's Luster en Benjy. Whut you let him go on dat way fer, Miss Cahline?"" ""You'd better do as he says,"" Mrs Compson said. ""He's head of the house now. It's his right to require us to respect his wishes. I try to do it, and if I can, you can too."" ""'Taint no sense in him bein so bad tempered he got to make Quentin git up jes to suit him,"" Dilsey said. ""Maybe you think she broke dat window."" ""She would, if she happened to think of it,"" Jason said. ""You go and do what I told you."" ""En I wouldn't blame her none ef she did,"" Dilsey said, going toward the stairs. ""Wid you naggin at her all de blessed time you in de house."" ""Hush, Dilsey,"" Mrs Compson said. ""It's neither your place nor mine to tell Jason what to do. Sometimes I think he is wrong, but I try to obey his wishes for you all's sakes. If I'm",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,109,"strong enough to come to the table, Quentin can too."" Dilsey went out. They heard her mounting the stairs. They heard her a long while on the stairs. ""You've got a prize set of servants,"" Jason said. He helped his mother and himself to food. ""Did you ever have one that was worth killing? You must have had some before I was big enough to remember."" ""I have to humor them,"" Mrs Compson said. ""I have to depend on them so completely. It's not as if I were strong. I wish I were. I wish I could do all the house work myself. I could at least take that much off your shoulders."" ""And a fine pigsty we'd live in, too,"" Jason said. ""Hurry up, Dilsey,"" he shouted. ""I know you blame me,"" Mrs Compson said, ""for letting them off to go to church today."" ""Go where?"" Jason said. ""Hasn't that damn show left yet?"" ""To church,"" Mrs Compson said. ""The darkies are having a special Easter service. I promised Dilsey two weeks ago that they could get off."" ""Which means we'll eat cold dinner,"" Jason said, ""or none at all."" ""I know it's my fault,"" Mrs Compson said. ""I know you blame me."" ""For what?"" Jason said. ""You never resurrected Christ, did you?"" They heard Dilsey mount the final stair, then her slow feet overhead. ""Quentin,"" she said. When she called the first time Jason laid his knife and fork down and he and his mother appeared to wait across the table from one another in identical attitudes; the one cold and shrewd, with close-thatched brown hair curled into two stubborn hooks, one on either side of his forehead like a bartender in caricature, and hazel eyes with black-ringed irises like marbles, the other cold and querulous, with perfectly white hair and eyes pouched and baffled and so dark as to appear to be all pupil or all iris. ""Quentin,"" Dilsey said. ""Get up, honey. Dey waitin breakfast on you."" ""I cant understand how that window got broken,"" Mrs Compson said. ""Are you sure it was done yesterday? It could have been like that a long time, with the warm weather. The upper sash, behind the shade like that."" ""I've told you for the last time that it happened yesterday,"" Jason said. ""Dont you reckon I know the room I live in? Do you reckon I could have lived in it a week with a hole in the window you could stick your hand...."" his voice ceased, ebbed, left him staring at his mother with eyes that for an instant were quite empty of anything. It was as though his eyes were holding their breath, while his mother looked at him, her face flaccid and querulous, interminable, clairvoyant yet obtuse. As they sat so Dilsey said, ""Quentin. Dont play wid me, honey. Come on to breakfast, honey. Dey waitin fer you."" ""I cant understand it,"" Mrs Compson said. ""It's just as if somebody had tried to break into the house--"" Jason sprang up. His chair crashed over backward. ""What--"" Mrs Compson said, staring at him as he ran past her and went jumping up the stairs, where he met Dilsey. His face was now in shadow, and Dilsey said, ""She sullin. Yo maw aint unlocked--"" But Jason ran on past her and along the corridor to a door. He didn't call. He grasped the knob and tried it, then he stood with the knob in his hand and his head bent a little, as if he were listening to something much further away than the dimensioned room beyond the door, and which he already heard. His attitude was that of one who goes through the motions of listening in order to deceive himself as to what he already hears. Behind him Mrs Compson mounted the stairs, calling his name. Then she saw Dilsey and she quit calling him and began to call Dilsey instead. ""I told you she aint unlocked dat do yit,"" Dilsey said. When she spoke he turned and ran toward her, but his voice was quiet, matter of fact. ""She carry the key with her?"" he said. ""Has she got it now, I mean, or will she have--"" ""Dilsey,"" Mrs Compson said on the stairs. ""Is which?"" Dilsey said. ""Whyn't you let--"" ""The key,"" Jason said. ""To that room. Does she carry it with her all the time. Mother."" Then he saw Mrs Compson and he went down the stairs and met her. ""Give me the key,"" he said. He fell to pawing at the pockets of the rusty black dressing sacque she wore. She resisted. ""Jason,"" she said. ""Jason! Are you and Dilsey trying to put me to bed again?"" she said, trying to fend him off. ""Cant you even let me have Sunday in",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,110,"peace?"" ""The key,"" Jason said, pawing at her. ""Give it here."" He looked back at the door, as if he expected it to fly open before he could get back to it with the key he did not yet have. ""You, Dilsey!"" Mrs Compson said, clutching her sacque about her. ""Give me the key, you old fool!"" Jason cried suddenly. From her pocket he tugged a huge bunch of rusted keys on an iron ring like a mediaeval jailer's and ran back up the hall with the two women behind him. ""You, Jason!"" Mrs Compson said. ""He will never find the right one,"" she said. ""You know I never let anyone take my keys, Dilsey,"" she said. She began to wail. ""Hush,"" Dilsey said. ""He aint gwine do nothin to her. I aint gwine let him."" ""But on Sunday morning, in my own house,"" Mrs Compson said. ""When I've tried so hard to raise them christians. Let me find the right key, Jason,"" she said. She put her hand on his arm. Then she began to struggle with him, but he flung her aside with a motion of his elbow and looked around at her for a moment, his eyes cold and harried, then he turned to the door again and the unwieldy keys. ""Hush,"" Dilsey said. ""You, Jason!"" ""Something terrible has happened,"" Mrs Compson said, wailing again. ""I know it has. You, Jason,"" she said, grasping at him again. ""He wont even let me find the key to a room in my own house!"" ""Now, now,"" Dilsey said. ""Whut kin happen? I right here. I aint gwine let him hurt her. Quentin,"" she said, raising her voice, ""dont you be skeered, honey, I'se right here."" The door opened, swung inward. He stood in it for a moment, hiding the room, then he stepped aside. ""Go in,"" he said in a thick, light voice. They went in. It was not a girl's room. It was not anybody's room, and the faint scent of cheap cosmetics and the few feminine objects and the other evidences of crude and hopeless efforts to feminise it but added to its anonymity, giving it that dead and stereotyped transience of rooms in assignation houses. The bed had not been disturbed. On the floor lay a soiled undergarment of cheap silk a little too pink, from a half open bureau drawer dangled a single stocking. The window was open. A pear tree grew there, close against the house. It was in bloom and the branches scraped and rasped against the house and the myriad air, driving in the window, brought into the room the forlorn scent of the blossoms. ""Dar now,"" Dilsey said. ""Didn't I told you she all right?"" ""All right?"" Mrs Compson said. Dilsey followed her into the room and touched her. ""You come on and lay down, now,"" she said. ""I find her in ten minutes."" Mrs Compson shook her off. ""Find the note,"" she said. ""Quentin left a note when he did it."" ""All right,"" Dilsey said. ""I'll find hit. You come on to yo room, now."" ""I knew the minute they named her Quentin this would happen,"" Mrs Compson said. She went to the bureau and began to turn over the scattered objects there--scent bottles, a box of powder, a chewed pencil, a pair of scissors with one broken blade lying upon a darned scarf dusted with powder and stained with rouge. ""Find the note,"" she said. ""I is,"" Dilsey said. ""You come on, now. Me and Jason'll find hit. You come on to yo room."" ""Jason,"" Mrs Compson said. ""Where is he?"" She went to the door. Dilsey followed her on down the hall, to another door. It was closed. ""Jason,"" she called through the door. There was no answer. She tried the knob, then she called him again. But there was still no answer, for he was hurling things backward out of the closet, garments, shoes, a suitcase. Then he emerged carrying a sawn section of tongue-and-groove planking and laid it down and entered the closet again and emerged with a metal box. He set it on the bed and stood looking at the broken lock while he dug a keyring from his pocket and selected a key, and for a time longer he stood with the selected key in his hand, looking at the broken lock. Then he put the keys back in his pocket and carefully tilted the contents of the box out upon the bed. Still carefully he sorted the papers, taking them up one at a time and shaking them. Then he upended the box and shook it too and slowly replaced the papers and stood again, looking at the broken lock, with the box in his hands and his head bent. Outside the window",no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,111,"he heard some jaybirds swirl shrieking past and away, their cries whipping away along the wind, and an automobile passed somewhere and died away also. His mother spoke his name again beyond the door, but he didn't move. He heard Dilsey lead her away up the hall, and then a door closed. Then he replaced the box in the closet and flung the garments back into it and went down stairs to the telephone. While he stood there with the receiver to his ear waiting Dilsey came down the stairs. She looked at him, without stopping, and went on. The wire opened. ""This is Jason Compson,"" he said, his voice so harsh and thick that he had to repeat himself. ""Jason Compson,"" he said, controlling his voice. ""Have a car ready, with a deputy, if you cant go, in ten minutes. I'll be there-- What?-- Robbery. My house. I know who it Robbery, I say. Have a car read-- What?? Aren't you a paid law enforcement-- Yes, I'll be there in five minutes. Have that car ready to leave at once. If you dont, I'll report it to the governor."" He clapped the receiver back and crossed the diningroom, where the scarce broken meal lay cold now on the table, and entered the kitchen. Dilsey was filling the hot water bottle. Ben sat, tranquil and empty. Beside him Luster looked like a fice dog, brightly watchful. He was eating something. Jason went on across the kitchen. ""Aint you going to eat no breakfast?"" Dilsey said. He paid her no attention. ""Go on en eat yo breakfast, Jason."" He went on. The outer door banged behind him. Luster rose and went to the window and looked out. ""Whoo,"" he said. ""Whut happenin up dar? He been beatin Miss Quentin?"" ""You hush yo mouf,"" Dilsey said. ""You git Benjy started now en I beat yo head off. You keep him quiet es you kin swell I git back, now."" She screwed the cap on the bottle and went out. They heard her go up the stairs, then they heard Jason pass the house in his car. Then there was no sound in the kitchen save the simmering murmur of the kettle and the clock. ""You know whut I bet?"" Luster said. ""I bet he beat her. I bet he knock her in de head en now he gone fer de doctor. Dat's whut I bet."" The clock tick-tocked, solemn and profound. It might have been the dry pulse of the decaying house itself, after a while it whirred and cleared its throat and struck six times. Ben looked up at it, then he looked at the bulletlike silhouette of Luster's head in the window and he begun to bob his head again, drooling. He whimpered. ""Hush up, looney,"" Luster said without turning. ""Look like we aint ""gwine git to go to no church today."" But Ben sat in the chair, his big soft hands dangling between his knees, moaning faintly. Suddenly he wept, a slow bellowing sound, meaningless and sustained. ""Hush,"" Luster said. He turned and lifted his hand. ""You want me to whup you?"" But Ben looked at him, bellowing slowly with each expiration. Luster came and shook him. ""You hush dis minute!"" he shouted. ""Here,"" he said. He hauled Ben out of the chair and dragged the chair around facing the stove and opened the door to the firebox and shoved Ben into the chair. They looked like a tug nudging at a clumsy tanker in a narrow dock. Ben sat down again facing the rosy door. He hushed. Then they heard the clock again, and Dilsey slow on the stairs. When she entered he began to whimper again. Then he lifted his voice. ""Whut you done to him?"" Dilsey said. ""Why cant you let him lone dis mawnin, of all times?"" ""I aint doin nothin to him,"" Luster said. ""Mr Jason skeered him, dat's whut hit is. He aint kilt Miss Quentin, is he?"" ""Hush, Benjy,"" Dilsey said. He hushed. She went to the window and looked out. ""Is it quit rainin?"" she said. ""Yessum,"" Luster said. ""Quit long time ago."" ""Den y'all go out do's a while,"" she said. ""I jes got Miss Cahline quiet now."" ""Is we gwine to church?"" Luster said. ""I let you know bout dat when de time come. You keep him away fum de house swell I calls you."" ""Kin we go to de pastuh?"" Luster said. ""All right. Only you keep him away fum de house. I done stood all I kin."" ""Yessum,"" Luster said. ""Whar Mr Jason gone, mammy?"" ""Dat's some mo of yo business, aint it?"" Dilsey said. She began to clear the table. ""Hush, Benjy. Luster gwine take you out to play."" ""Whut he done to Miss Quentin, mammy?""",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,112,"Luster said. ""Aint done nothin to her. You all git on outen here."" ""I bet she aint here,"" Luster said. Dilsey looked at him. ""How you know she aint here?"" ""Me and Benjy seed her clamb out de window last night. Didn't us, Benjy?"" ""You did?"" Dilsey said, looking at him. ""We sees her doin hit ev'y night,"" Luster said. ""Clamb right down dat pear tree."" ""Dont you lie to me, nigger boy,"" Dilsey said. ""I aint lyin. Ask Benjy ef I is."" ""Whyn't you say somethin about it, den?"" ""'Twarn't none o my business,"" Luster said. ""I aint gwine git mixed up in white folks' business. Come on here, Benjy, les go out do's."" They went out. Dilsey stood for a while at the table, then she went and cleared the breakfast things from the diningroom and ate her breakfast and cleaned up the kitchen. Then she removed her apron and hung it up and went to the foot of the stairs and listened for a moment. There was no sound. She donned the overcoat and the hat and went across to her cabin. The rain had stopped. The air now drove out of the southeast, broken overhead into blue patches. Upon the crest of a hill beyond the trees and roofs and spires of town sunlight lay like a pale scrap of cloth, was blotted away. Upon the air a bell came, then as if at a signal, other bells took up the sound and repeated it. The cabin door opened and Dilsey emerged, again in the maroon cape and the purple gown, and wearing soiled white elbow-length gloves and minus her headcloth now. She came into the yard and called Luster. She waited a while, then she went to the house and around it to the cellar door, moving close to the wall, and looked into the door. Ben sat on the steps. Before him Luster squatted on the damp floor. He held a saw in his left hand, the blade sprung a little by pressure of his hand, and he was in the act of striking the blade with the worn wooden mallet with which she had been making beaten biscuit for more than thirty years. The saw gave forth a single sluggish twang that ceased with lifeless alacrity, leaving the blade in a thin clean curve between Luster's hand and the floor. Still, inscrutable, it bellied. ""Dat's de way he done hit,"" Luster said. ""I jes aint foun de right thing to hit it wid."" ""Dat's whut you doin, is it?"" Dilsey said. ""Bring me dat mallet,"" she said. ""I aint hurt hit,"" Luster said. ""Bring hit here,"" Dilsey said. ""Put dat saw whar you got hit first."" He put the saw away and brought the mallet to her. Then Ben wailed again, hopeless and prolonged. It was nothing. Just sound. It might have been all time and injustice and sorrow become vocal for an instant by a conjunction of planets. ""Listen at him,"" Luster said. ""He been gwine on dat way ev'y since you vent us outen de house. I dont know whut got in to him dis mawnin."" ""Bring him here,"" Dilsey said. ""Come on, Benjy,"" Luster said. He went back down the steps and took Ben's arm. He came obediently, wailing, that slow hoarse sound that ships make, that seems to begin before the sound itself has started, seems to cease before the sound itself has stopped. ""Run and git his cap,"" Dilsey said. ""Dont make no noise Miss Cahline kin hear. Hurry, now. We already late."" ""She gwine hear him anyhow, ef you dont stop him,"" Luster said. ""He stop when we git off de place,"" Dilsey said. ""He smellin hit. Dat's whut hit is."" ""Smell whut, mammy?"" Luster said. ""You go git dat cap,"" Dilsey said. Luster went on. They stood in the cellar door, Ben one step below her. The sky was broken now into scudding patches that dragged their swift shadows up out of the shabby garden, over the broken fence and across the yard. Dilsey stroked Ben's head, slowly and steadily, smoothing the bang upon his brow. He wailed quietly, unhurriedly. ""Hush,"" Dilsey said. ""Hush, now. We be gone in a minute. Hush, now."" He wailed quietly and steadily. Luster returned, wearing a stiff new straw hat with a colored band and carrying a cloth cap. The hat seemed to isolate Luster's skull, in the beholder's eye as a spotlight would, in all its individual planes and angles. So peculiarly individual was its shape that at first glance the hat appeared to be on the head of someone standing immediately behind Luster. Dilsey looked at the hat. ""Whyn't you wear yo old hat?"" she said. ""Couldn't find hit,"" Luster said. ""I bet you couldn't. I bet you",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,113,"fixed hit last night so you couldn't find hit. You fixin to ruin dat un."" ""Aw, mammy,"" Luster said. ""Hit aint gwine rain."" ""How you know? You go git dat old hat en put dat new un away."" ""Aw, mammy."" ""Den you go git de umbreller."" ""Aw, mammy."" ""Take yo choice,"" Dilsey said. ""Git yo old hat, er de umbreller. I dont keer which."" Luster went to the cabin. Ben wailed quietly. ""Come on,"" Dilsey said. ""Dey kin ketch up wid us. We ""wine to hear de singin."" They went around the house, toward the gate. ""Hush,"" Dilsey said from time to time as they went down the drive. They reached the gate. Dilsey opened it. Luster was coming down the drive behind them, carrying the umbrella. A woman was with him. ""Here dey come,"" Dilsey said. They passed out the gate. ""Now, den,"" she said. Ben ceased. Luster and his mother overtook them. Frony wore a dress of bright blue silk and a flowered hat. She was a thin woman, with a flat, pleasant face. ""You got six weeks' work right dar on yo back,"" Dilsey said. ""Whut you gwine do ef hit rain?"" ""Git wet, I reckon,"" Frony said. ""I aint never stopped no rain yit."" ""Mammy always talkin bout hit gwine rain,"" Luster said. ""Ef I dont worry bout y'all, I dont know who is,"" Dilsey said. ""Come on, we already late."" ""Rev'un Shegog gwine preach today,"" Frony said. ""Is?"" Dilsey said. ""Who him?"" ""He fum Saint Looey,"" Frony said. ""Dat big preacher."" ""Huh,"" Dilsey said. ""Whut dey needs is a man kin put de fear of God into dese here triflin young niggers."" ""Rev'un Shegog kin do dat,"" Frony said. ""So dey tells."" They went on along the street. Along its quiet length white people in bright clumps moved churchward, under the windy bells, walking now and then in the random and tentative sun. The wind was gusty, out of the southeast, chill and raw after the warm days. ""I wish you wouldn't keep on bringin him to church, mammy,"" Frony said. ""Folks talkin."" ""Whut folks?"" Dilsey said. ""I hears em,"" Frony said. ""And I knows whut kind of folks,"" Dilsey said. ""Trash white folks. Dat's who it is. Thinks he aint good enough fer white church, but nigger church aint good enough fer him."" ""Dey talks, jes de same,"" Frony said. ""Den you send um to me,"" Dilsey said. ""Tell um de good Lawd dont keer whether he bright er not. Dont nobody but white trash keer dat."" A street turned off at right angles, descending, and became a dirt road. On either hand the land dropped more sharply; a broad flat dotted with small cabins whose weathered roofs were on a level with the crown of the road. They were set in small grassless plots littered with broken things, bricks, planks, crockery, things of a once utilitarian value. What growth there was consisted of rank weeds and the trees were mulberries and locusts and sycamores--trees that partook also of the foul desiccation which surrounded the houses; trees whose very burgeoning seemed to be the sad and stubborn remnant of September, as if even spring had passed them by, leaving them to feed upon the rich and unmistakable smell of negroes in which they grew. From the doors negroes spoke to them as they passed, to Dilsey usually: ""Sis' Gibson! How you dis mawnin?"" ""I'm well. Is you well?"" ""I'm right well, I thank you."" They emerged from the cabins and struggled up the sharing levee to the road--men in staid, hard brown or black, with gold watch chains and now and then a stick; young men in cheap violent blues or stripes and swaggering hats; women a little stiffly sibilant, and children in garments bought second hand of white people, who looked at Ben with the covertness of nocturnal animals: ""I bet you wont go up en tech him."" ""How come I wont?"" ""I bet you wont. I bet you skeered to."" ""He wont hurt folks. He des a looney."" ""How come a looney wont hurt folks?"" ""sat un wont. I teched him."" ""I bet you wont now."" ""Case Miss Dilsey lookin."" ""You wont no ways."" ""He dont hurt folks. He des a looney."" And steadily the older people speaking to Dilsey, though, unless they were quite old, Dilsey permitted Frony to respond. ""Mammy aint feelin well dis mawnin."" ""Dat's too bad. But Rev'un Shegog'll kyo dat. He'll give her de comfort en de unburdenin."" The road rose again, to a scene like a painted backdrop. Notched into a cut of red clay crowned with oaks the road appeared to stop short off, like a cut ribbon. Beside it a weathered church lifted its crazy steeple like a painted church, and the whole scene",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,114,"was as flat and without perspective as a painted cardboard set upon the ultimate edge of the flat earth, against the windy sunlight of space and April and a midmorning filled with bells. Toward the church they thronged with slow sabbath deliberation, the women and children went on in, the men stopped outside and talked in quiet groups until the bell ceased ringing. Then they too entered. The church had been decorated, with sparse flowers from kitchen gardens and hedgerows, and with streamers of colored crepe paper. Above the pulpit hung a battered Christmas bell, the accordion sort that collapses. The pulpit was empty, though the choir was already in place, fanning themselves although it was not warm. Most of the women were gathered on one side of the room. They were talking. Then the bell struck one time and they dispersed to their seats and the congregation sat for an instant, expectant. The bell struck again one time. The choir rose and began to sing and the congregation turned its head as one as six small children--four girls with tight pigtails bound with small scraps of cloth like butterflies, and two boys with close napped heads--entered and marched up the aisle, strung together in a harness of white ribbons and flowers, and followed by two men in single file. The second man was huge, of a light coffee color, imposing in a frock coat and white tie. His head was magisterial and profound, his neck rolled above his collar in rich folds. But he was familiar to them, and so the heads were still reverted when he had passed, and it was not until the choir ceased singing that they realised that the visiting clergyman had already entered, and when they saw the man who had preceded their minister enter the pulpit still ahead of him an indescribable sound went up, a sigh, a sound of astonishment and disappointment. The visitor was undersized, in a shabby alpaca coat. He had a wizened black face like a small, aged monkey. And all the while that the choir sang again and while the six children rose and sang in thin, frightened, tuneless whispers, they watched the insignificant looking man sitting dwarfed and countrified by the minister's imposing bulk, with something like consternation. They were still looking at him with consternation and unbelief when the minister rose and introduced him in rich, rolling tones whose very unction served to increase the visitor's insignificance. ""En dey brung dat all de way fum Saint Looey,"" Frony whispered. ""I've knowed de Lawd to use cuiser tools den dat,"" Dilsey said. ""Hush, now,"" she said to Ben. ""Dey fixin to sing again in a minute."" When the visitor rose to speak he sounded like a white man. His voice was level and cold. It sounded too big to have come from him and they listened at first through curiosity, as they would have to a monkey talking. They began to watch him as they would a man on a tight rope. They even forgot his insignificant appearance in the virtuosity with which he ran and poised and swooped upon the cold inflectionless wire of his voice, so that at last, when with a sort of swooping glide he came to rest again beside the reading desk with one arm resting upon it at shoulder height and his monkey body as reft of all motion as a mummy or an emptied vessel, the congregation sighed as if it waked from a collective dream and moved a little in its seats. Behind the pulpit the choir fanned steadily. Dilsey whispered, ""Hush, now. Dey fixin to sing in a minute."" Then a voice said, ""Brethren."" The preacher had not moved. His arm lay yet across the desk, and he still held that pose while the voice died in sonorous echoes between the walls. It was as different as day and dark from his former tone, with a sad, timbrous quality like an alto horn, sinking into their hearts and speaking there again when it had ceased in fading and cumulate echoes. ""Brethren and sisteren,"" it said again. The preacher removed his arm and he began to walk back and forth before the desk, his hands clasped behind him, a meagre figure, hunched over upon itself like that of one long immured in striving with the implacable earth, ""I got the recollection and the blood of the Lamb!"" He tramped steadily back and forth beneath the twisted paper and the Christmas bell, hunched, his hands clasped behind him. He was like a worn small rock whelmed by the successive waves of his voice. With his body he seemed to feed the voice that, succubus like, had fleshed its teeth in him. And the congregation seemed to watch with its own",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,115,"eyes while the voice consumed him, until he was nothing and they were nothing and there was not even a voice but instead their hearts were speaking to one another in chanting measures beyond the need for words, so that when he came to rest against the reading desk, his monkey face lifted and his whole attitude that of a serene, tortured crucifix that transcended its shabbiness and insignificance and made it of no moment, a long moaning expulsion of breath rose from them, and a woman's single soprano: ""Yes, Jesus!"" As the scudding day passed overhead the dingy windows glowed and faded in ghostly retrograde. A car passed along the road outside, laboring in the sand, died away. Dilsey sat bolt upright, her hand on Ben's knee. Two tears slid down her fallen cheeks, in and out of the myriad coruscations of immolation and abnegation and time. ""Brethren,"" the minister said in a harsh whisper, without moving. ""Yes, Jesus!"" the woman's voice said, hushed yet. ""Breddren en sistuhn!"" His voice rang again, with the horns. He removed his arm and stood erect and raised his hands. ""I got de ricklickshun en de blood of de Lamb!"" They did not mark just when his intonation, his pronunciation, became negroid, they just sat swaying a little in their seats as the voice took them into itself. ""When de long, cold--Oh, I tells you, breddren, when de long, cold.... I sees de light en I sees de word, po sinner! Dey passed away in Egypt, de swingin chariots; de generations passed away. Wus a rich man: whar he now, O breddren? Wus a po man: whar he now, O sistuhn? Oh I tells you, ef you aint got de milk en de dew of de old salvation when de long, cold years rolls away!"" ""Yes, Jesus!"" ""I tells you, breddren, en I tells you, sistuhn, dey'll come a time. Po sinner sayin Let me lay down wid de Lawd, femme lay down my load. Den whut Jesus ""wine say, O breddren? O sistuhn? Is you got de ricklickshun en de Blood of de Lamb? Case I aint gwine load down heaven!"" He fumbled in his coat and took out a handkerchief and mopped his face. A low concerted sound rose from the congregation: ""Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!"" The woman's voice said, ""Yes, Jesus! Jesus!"" ""Breddren! Look at dem little chiller settin dar. Jesus wus like dat once. He mammy suffered de glory en de pangs. Sometime maybe she heft him at de nightfall, whilst de angels singin him to sleep; maybe she look out de do en see de Roman po-lice passin."" He tramped back and forth, mopping his face. ""Listen, breddren! I sees de day. Ma'y settin in de do wid Jesus on her lap, de little Jesus. Like dem chiller dar, de little Jesus. I hears de angels singin de peaceful songs en de glory; I sees de closin eyes; sees Mary jump up, sees de sojer face: We gwine to kill! We gwine to kill! We gwine to kill yo little Jesus! I hears de weepin en de lamentation of de po mammy widout de salvation en de word of God!"" ""Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! Jesus! Little Jesus! and another voice, rising: ""I sees, O Jesus! Oh I sees!"" and still another, without words, like bubbles rising in water. ""I sees hit, breddren! I sees hit! Sees de blastin, blindin sight! I sees Calvary, wid de sacred trees, sees de thief en de murderer en de least of dese; I hears de boastin en de braggin: Ef you be Jesus, lif up yo tree en walk! I hears de wailin of women en de evenin lamentations; I hears de weepin en de cryin en de turns-away face of God: dey done kilt Jesus; dey done kilt my Son!"" ""Mmmmmmmmmmmmm. Jesus! I sees, O Jesus!"" ""O blind sinner! Breddren, I tells you; sistuhn, I says to you, when de Lawd did turn His mighty face, say, Aint ""wine overload heaven! I can see de widowed God shet His do; I sees de whelmin flood roll between; I sees de darkness en de death everlastin upon de generations. Den, lo! Breddren! Yes, breddren! Whut I see? Whut I see, O sinner? I sees de resurrection en de light; sees de meek Jesus sayin Dey kilt me dat ye shall live again; I died dat dem whut sees en believes shall never die. Breddren, O breddren! I sees de doom crack en de golden horns shoutin down de glory, en de arisen dead whut got de blood en de ricklickshun of de Lamb!"" In the midst of the voices and the hands Ben sat, rapt in his sweet blue gaze. Dilsey sat bolt upright beside, crying rigidly and quietly in the annealment and the blood of the remembered",no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,116,"Lamb. As they walked through the bright noon, up the sandy road with the dispersing congregation talking easily again group to group, she continued to weep, unmindful of the talk. ""He sho a preacher, mon!! He didn't look like much at first, but hush!"" ""He seed de power en de glory."" ""Yes, suh. He seed hit. Face to face he seed hit."" Dilsey made no sound, her face did not quiver as the tears took their sunken and devious courses, walking with her head up, making no effort to dry them away even. ""Whyn't you quit dat, mammy?"" Frony said. ""Wid all dese people lookin. We be passin white folks soon."" ""I've seed de first en de last,"" Dilsey said. ""Never you mind me."" ""First en last whut?"" Frony said. ""Never you mind,"" Dilsey said. ""I seed de beginnin, en now I sees de endin."" Before they reached the street though she stopped and lifted her skirt and dried her eyes on the hem of her topmost underskirt. Then they went on. Ben shambled along beside Dilsey, watching Luster who anticked along ahead, the umbrella in his hand and his new straw hat slanted viciously in the sunlight, like a big foolish dog watching a small clever one. They reached the gate and entered. Immediately Ben began to whimper again, and for a while all of them looked up the drive at the square, paintless house with its rotting portico. ""Whut's gwine on up dar today?"" Frony said. ""Somethin is."" ""Nothin,"" Dilsey said. ""You tend to yo business en let de whitefolks tend to deir'n."" ""Somethin is,"" Frony said. ""I heard him first thing dis mawnin. 'Taint none of my business, dough."" ""En I knows whut, too,"" Luster said. ""You knows mo den you got any use fer,"" Dilsey said. ""Aint you jes heard Frony say hit aint none of yo business? You take Benjy on to de back and keep him quiet swell I put dinner on."" ""I knows whar Miss Quentin is,"" Luster said. ""Den jes keep hit,"" Dilsey said. ""Soon es Quentin need any of yo egvice, I'll let you know. Y'all g'awn en play in de back, now."" ""You know whut gwine happen soon es dey start playin dat ball over yonder,"" Luster said. ""Dey wont start fer a while yit. By dat time T. P. be here to take him ridin. Here, you gimme dat new hat."" Luster gave her the hat and he and Ben went on across the back yard. Ben was still whimpering, though not loud. Dilsey and Frony went to the cabin. After a while Dilsey emerged, again in the faded calico dress, and went to the kitchen. The fire had died down. There was no sound in the house. She put on the apron and went up stairs. There was no sound anywhere. Quentin's room was as they had left it. She entered and picked up the undergarment and put the stocking back in the drawer and closed it. Mrs Compson's door was closed. Dilsey stood beside it for a moment, listening. Then she opened it and entered, entered a pervading reek of camphor. The shades were drawn, the room in halflight, and the bed, so that at first she thought Mrs Compson was asleep and was about to close the door when the other spoke. ""Well?"" she said. ""What is it?"" ""Hit's me,"" Dilsey said. ""You want anything?"" Mrs Compson didn't answer. After a while, without moving her head at all, she said: ""Where's Jason?"" ""He aint come back yit,"" Dilsey said. ""Whut you want?"" Mrs Compson said nothing. Like so many cold, weak people, when faced at last by the incontrovertible disaster she exhumed from somewhere a sort of fortitude, strength. In her case it was an unshakable conviction regarding the yet unplumbed event. ""Well,"" she said presently. ""Did you find it?"" ""Find whut? Whut you talkin about?"" ""The note. At least she would have enough consideration to leave a note. Even Quentin did that."" ""Whut you talkin about?"" Dilsey said. ""Dont you know she all right? I bet she be walkin right in dis do befo dark."" ""Fiddlesticks,"" Mrs Compson said. ""It's in the blood. Like uncle, like niece. Or mother. I dont know which would be worse. I dont seem to care."" ""Whut you keep on talkin that way fur?"" Dilsey said. ""Whut she want to do anything like that fur?"" ""I dont know. What reason did Quentin have? Under God's heaven what reason did he have? It cant be simply to flout and hurt me. Whoever God is, He would not permit that. I'm a lady. You might not believe that from my offspring, but I am."" ""You des wait en see,"" Dilsey said. ""She be here by night, right dar in her bed."" Mrs",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,117,"Compson said nothing. The camphor soaked cloth lay upon her brow. The black robe lay across the foot of the bed. Dilsey stood with her hand on the door knob. ""Well,"" Mrs Compson said. ""What do you want? Are you going to fix some dinner for Jason and Benjamin, or not?"" ""Jason aint come yit,"" Dilsey said. ""I gwine fix somethin. You sho you dont want nothin? Yo bottle still hot enough?"" ""You might hand me my bible."" ""I give hit to you dis mawnin, befo I left."" ""You laid it on the edge of the bed. How long did you expect it to stay there?"" Dilsey crossed to the bed and groped among the shadows beneath the edge of it and found the bible, face down. She smoothed the bent pages and laid the book on the bed again. Mrs Compson didn't open her eyes. Her hair and the pillow were the same color, beneath the wimple of the medicated cloth she looked like an old nun praying. ""Dont put it there again,"" she said, without opening her eyes. ""That's where you put it before. Do you want me to have to get out of bed to pick it up?"" Dilsey reached the book across her and laid it on the broad side of the bed. ""You cant see to read, noways,"" she said. ""You want me to raise de shade a little?"" ""No. Let them alone. Go on and fix Jason something to eat."" Dilsey went out. She closed the door and returned to the kitchen. The stove was almost cold. While she stood there the clock above the cupboard struck ten times. ""One oclock,"" she said aloud. ""Jason aint comin home. Ise seed de first en de last,"" she said, looking at the cold stove. ""I seed de first en de last."" She set out some cold food on a table. As she moved back and forth she sang, a hymn. She sang the first two lines over and over to the complete tune. She arranged the meal and went to the door and called Luster, and after a time Luster and Ben entered. Ben was still moaning a little, as to himself. ""He aint never quit,"" Luster said. ""Y'all come on en eat,"" Dilsey said. ""Jason aint comin to dinner."" They sat down at the table. Ben could manage solid food pretty well for himself, though even now, with cold food before him, Dilsey tied a cloth about his neck. He and Luster ate. Dilsey moved about the kitchen, singing the two lines of the hymn which she remembered. ""Y'all kin g'awn en eat,"" she said. ""Jason aint comin home."" He was twenty miles away at that time. When he left the house he drove rapidly to town, overreaching the slow sabbath groups and the peremptory bells along the broken air. He crossed the empty square and turned into a narrow street that was abruptly quieter even yet, and stopped before a frame house and went up the flower bordered walk to the porch. Beyond the screen door people were talking. As he lifted his hand to knock he heard steps, so he withheld his hand until a big man in black broadcloth trousers and a stiff bosomed white shirt without collar opened the door. He had vigorous untidy iron-gray hair and his gray eyes were round and shiny like a little boy's. He took Jason's hand and drew him into the house, still shaking it. ""Come right in,"" he said. ""Come right in."" ""You ready to go now?"" Jason said. ""Walk right in,"" the other said, propelling him by the elbow into a room where a man and a woman sat. ""You know Myrtle's husband, dont you? Jason Compson, Vernon."" ""Yes,"" Jason said. He did not even look at the man, and as the sheriff drew a chair across the room the man said, ""We'll go out so you can talk. Come on, Myrtle."" ""No, no,"" the sheriff said. ""You folks keep your seat. I reckon it aint that serious, Jason? Have a seat."" ""I'll tell you as we go along,"" Jason said. ""Get your hat and coat."" ""We'll go out,"" the man said, rising. ""Keep your seat,"" the sheriff said. ""Me and Jason will go out on the porch."" ""You get your hat and coat,"" Jason said. ""They've already got a twelve hour start."" The sheriff led the way back to the porch. A man and a woman passing spoke to him. He responded with a hearty florid gesture. Bells were still ringing, from the direction of the section known as Nigger Hollow. ""Get your hat, Sheriff,"" Jason said. The sheriff drew up two chairs. ""Have a seat and tell me what the trouble is."" ""I told you over the phone,"" Jason said, standing.",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
sound-and-fury,118,"""I did that to save time. Am I going to have to go to law to compel you to do your sworn duty?"" ""You sit down and tell me about it,"" the sheriff said. ""I'll take care of you all right."" ""Care, hell,"" Jason said. ""Is this what you call taking care of me?"" ""You're the one that's holding us up,"" the sheriff said. ""You sit down and tell me about it."" Jason told him, his sense of injury and impotence feeding upon its own sound, so that after a time he forgot his haste in the violent cumulation of his self justification and his outrage. The sheriff watched him steadily with his cold shiny eyes. ""But you dont know they done it,"" he said. ""You just think so."" ""Dont know?"" Jason said. ""When I spent two damn days chasing her through alleys, trying to keep her away from him, after I told her what I'd do to her if I ever caught her with him, and you say I dont know that that little b-- "" ""Now, then,"" the sheriff said. ""That'll do. That's enough of that."" He looked out across the street, his hands in his pockets. ""And when I come to you, a commissioned officer of the law,"" Jason said. ""That show's in Mottson this week,"" the sheriff said. ""Yes,"" Jason said. ""And if I could find a law officer that gave a solitary damn about protecting the people that elected him to office, I'd be there too by now."" He repeated his story, harshly recapitulant, seeming to get an actual pleasure out of his outrage and impotence. The sheriff did not appear to be listening at all. ""Jason,"" he said. ""What were you doing with three thousand dollars hid in the house?"" ""What?"" Jason said. ""That's my business where I keep my money. Your business is to help me get it back."" ""Did your mother know you had that much on the place?"" ""Look here,"" Jason said. ""My house has been robbed. I know who did it and I know where they are. I come to you as the commissioned officer of the law, and I ask you once more, are you going to make any effort to recover my property, or not?"" ""What do you aim to do with that girl, if you catch them?"" ""Nothing,"" Jason said. ""Not anything. I wouldn't lay my hand on her. The bitch that cost me a job, the one chance 1 ever had to get ahead, that killed my father and is shortening my mother's life every day and made my name a laughing stock in the town. I wont do anything to her,"" he said. ""Not anything."" ""You drove that girl into running off, Jason,"" the sheriff said. ""How I conduct my family is no business of yours,"" Jason said. ""Are you going to help me or not?"" ""You drove her away from home,"" the sheriff said. ""And I have some suspicions about who that money belongs to that I dont reckon I'll ever know for certain."" Jason stood, slowly wringing the brim of his hat in his hands. He said quietly: ""You're not going to make any effort to catch them for me?"" ""That's not any of my business, Jason. If you had any actual proof, I'd have to act. But without that I dont figger it's any of my business."" ""That's your answer, is it?"" Jason said. ""Think well, now."" ""That's it, Jason."" ""All right,"" Jason said. He put his hat on. ""You'll regret this. I wont be helpless. This is not Russia, where just because he wears a little metal badge, a man is immune to law."" He went down the steps and got in his car and started the engine. The sheriff watched him drive away, turn, and rush past the house toward town. The bells were ringing again, high in the scudding sunlight in bright disorderly tatters of sound. He stopped at a filling station and had his tires examined and the tank filled. ""Gwine on a trip, is you?"" the negro asked him. He didn't answer. ""Look like hit gwine fair off, after all,"" the negro said. ""Fair off, hell,"" Jason said. ""It'll be raining like hell by twelve oclock."" He looked at the sky, thinking about rain, about the slick clay roads, himself stalled somewhere miles from town. He thought about it with a sort of triumph, of the fact that he was going to miss dinner, that by starting now and so serving his compulsion of haste, he would be at the greatest possible distance from both towns when noon came. It seemed to him that in this circumstance was giving him a break, so he said to the negro: ""What the hell are you doing? Has somebody paid",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,119,"you to keep this car standing here as long as you can?"" ""Dis here ti' aint got no air a-tall in hit,"" the negro said. ""Then get the hell away from there and let me have that tube,"" Jason said. ""Hit up now,"" the negro said, rising. ""You kin ride now."" Jason got in and started the engine and drove off. He went into second gear, the engine spluttering and gasping, and he raced the engine, jamming the throttle down and snapping the choker in and out savagely. ""It's going to rain,"" he said. ""Get me half way there, and rain like hell."" And he drove on out of the bells and out of town, thinking of himself slogging through the mud, hunting a team. ""And every damn one of them will be at church."" He thought of how he'd find a church at last and take a team and of the owner coming out, shouting at him and of himself striking the man down. ""I'm Jason Compson. See if you can stop me. See if you can elect a man to office that can stop me,"" he said, thinking of himself entering the courthouse with a file of soldiers and dragging the sheriff out. ""Thinks he can sit with his hands folded and see me lose my job. I'll show him about jobs."" Of his niece he did not think at all, nor of the arbitrary valuation of the money. Neither of them had had entity or individuality for him for ten years; together they merely symbolised the job in the bank of which he had been deprived before he ever got it. The air brightened, the running shadow patches were now the obverse, and it seemed to him that the fact that the day was clearing was another cunning stroke on the part of the foe, the fresh battle toward which he was carrying ancient wounds. From time to time he passed churches, unpainted frame buildings with sheet iron steeples, surrounded by tethered teams and shabby motorcars, and it seemed to him that each of them was a picket-post where the rear guards of Circumstance peeped fleetingly back at him. ""And damn You, too,"" he said. ""See if You can stop me,"" thinking of himself, his file of soldiers with the manacled sheriff in the rear, dragging Omnipotence down from his throne, if necessary; of the embattled legions of both hell and heaven through which he tore his way and put his hands at last on his fleeing niece. The wind was out of the southeast. It blew steadily upon his cheek. It seemed that he could feel the prolonged blow of it sinking through his skull, and suddenly with an old premonition he clapped the brakes on and stopped and sat perfectly still. Then he lifted his hand to his neck and began to curse, and sat there, cursing in a harsh whisper. When it was necessary for him to drive for any length of time he fortified himself with a handkerchief soaked in camphor, which he would tie about his throat when clear of town, thus inhaling the fumes, and he got out and lifted the seat cushion on the chance that there might be a forgotten one there. He looked beneath both seats and stood again for a while, cursing, seeing himself mocked by his own triumphing. He closed his eyes, leaning on the door. He could return and get the forgotten camphor, or he could go on. In either case, his head would be splitting, but at home he could be sure of finding camphor on Sunday, while if he went on he could not be sure. But if he went back, he would be an hour and a half later in reaching Mottson. ""Maybe I can drive slow,"" he said. ""Maybe I can drive slow, thinking of something else...."" He got in and started. ""I'll think of something else,"" he said, so he thought about Lorraine. He imagined himself in bed with her, only he was just lying beside her, pleading with her to help him, then he thought of the money again, and that he had been outwitted by a woman, a girl. If he could just believe it was the man who had robbed him. But to have been robbed of that which was to have compensated him for the lost job, which he had acquired through so much effort and risk, by the very symbol of the lost job itself, and worst of all, by a bitch of a girl. He drove on, shielding his face from the steady wind with the corner of his coat. He could see the opposed forces of his destiny and his will drawing swiftly together now, toward a junction that would be irrevocable; he",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
sound-and-fury,120,"became cunning. I cant make a blunder, he told himself. There would be just one right thing, without alternatives: he must do that. He believed that both of them would know him on sight, while he'd have to trust to seeing her first, unless the man still wore the red tie. And the fact that he must depend on that red tie seemed to be the sum of the impending disaster; he could almost smell it, feel it above the throbbing of his head. He crested the final hill. Smoke lay in the valley, and roofs, a spire or two above trees. He drove down the hill and into the town, slowing, telling himself again of the need for caution, to find where the tent was located first. He could not see very well now, and he knew that it was the disaster which kept telling him to go directly and get something for his head. At a filling station they told him that the tent was not up yet, but that the show cars were on a siding at the station. He drove there. Two gaudily painted pullman cars stood on the track. He reconnoitred them before he got out. He was trying to breathe shallowly, so that the blood would not beat so in his skull. He got out and went along the station wall, watching the cars. A few garments hung out of the windows, limp and crinkled, as though they had been recently laundered. On the earth beside the steps of one sat three canvas chairs. But he saw no sign of life at all until a man in a dirty apron came to the door and emptied a pan of dishwater with a broad gesture, the sunlight glinting on the metal belly of the pan, then entered the car again. Now I'll have to take him by surprise, before he can warn them, he thought. It never occurred to him that they might not be there, in the car. That they should not be there, that the whole result should not hinge on whether he saw them first or they saw him first, would be opposed to all nature and contrary to the whole rhythm of events. And more than that: he must see them first, get the money back, then what they did would be of no importance to him, while otherwise the whole world would know that he, Jason Compson, had been robbed by Quentin, his niece, a bitch. He reconnoitred again. Then he went to the car and mounted the steps, swiftly and quietly, and paused at the door. The galley was dark, rank with stale food. The man was a white blur, singing in a cracked, shaky tenor. An old man, he thought, and not as big as I am. He entered the car as the man looked up. ""Hey?"" the man said, stopping his song. ""Where are they?"" Jason said. ""Quick, now. In the sleeping car?"" ""Where's who?"" the man said. ""Dont lie to me,"" Jason said. He blundered on in the cluttered obscurity. ""What's that?"" the other said. ""Who you calling a liar?"" and when Jason grasped his shoulder he exclaimed, ""Look out, fellow!"" ""Dont lie,"" Jason said. ""Where are they?"" ""Why, you bastard,"" the man said. His arm was frail and thin in Jason's grasp. He tried to wrench free, then he turned and fell to scrabbling on the littered table behind him. ""Come on,"" Jason said. ""Where are they?"" ""I'll tell you where they are,"" the man shrieked. ""Lemme find my butcher knife."" ""Here,"" Jason said, trying to hold the other. ""I'm just asking you a question."" ""You bastard,"" the other shrieked, scrabbling at the table. Jason tried to grasp him in both arms, trying to prison the puny fury of him. The man's body felt so old, so frail, yet so fatally single-purposed that for the first time Jason saw clear and unshadowed the disaster toward which he rushed. ""Quit it!"" he said. ""Here. Here! I'll get out. Give me time, and I'll get out."" ""Call me a liar,"" the other wailed. ""Lemme go. Lemme go just one minute. I'll show you."" Jason glared wildly about, holding the other. Outside it was now bright and sunny, swift and bright and empty, and he thought of the people soon to be going quietly home to Sunday dinner, decorously festive, and of himself trying to hold the fatal, furious little old man whom he dared not release long enough to turn his back and run. ""Will you quit long enough for me to get out?"" he said. ""Will you?"" But the other still struggled, and Jason freed one hand and struck him on the head. A clumsy, hurried blow, and not hard, but the other slumped immediately and",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,121,"slid clattering among pans and buckets to the floor. Jason stood above him, panting, listening. Then he turned and ran from the car. At the door he restrained himself and descended more slowly and stood there again. His breath made a hah hah hah sound and he stood there trying to repress it, darting his gaze this way and that, when at a scuffling sound behind him he turned in time to see the little old man leaping awkwardly and furiously from the vestibule, a rusty hatchet high in his hand. He grasped at the hatchet, feeling no shock but knowing that he was falling, thinking So this is how it'll end, and he believed that he was about to die and when something crashed against the back of his head he thought How did he hit me there? Only maybe he hit me a long time ago, he thought, And I just now felt it, and he thought Hurry. Hurry. Get it over with, and then a furious desire not to die seized him and he struggled, hearing the old man wailing and cursing in his cracked voice. He still struggled when they hauled him to his feet, but they held him and he ceased. ""Am I bleeding much?"" he said. ""The back of my head. Am I bleeding?"" He was still saying that while he felt himself being propelled rapidly away, heard the old man's thin furious voice dying away behind him. ""Look at my head,"" he said. ""Wait, I'--"" ""Wait, hell,"" the man who held him said. ""That damn little wasp'll kill you. Keep going. You aint hurt."" ""He hit me,"" Jason said. ""Am I bleeding?"" ""Keep going,"" the other said. He led Jason on around the corner of the station, to the empty platform where an express truck stood, where grass grew rigidly in a plot bordered with rigid flowers and a sign in electric on Mottson, the gap filled by a human eye with an lights: Keep your electric pupil. The man released him. ""Now,"" he said. ""You get on out of here and stay out. What were you trying to do? commit suicide?"" ""I was looking for two people,"" Jason said. ""I just asked him where they were."" ""Who you looking for?"" ""It's a girl,"" Jason said. ""And a man. He had on a red tie in Jefferson yesterday. With this show. They robbed me."" ""Oh,"" the man said. ""You're the one, are you. Well, they aint here."" ""I reckon so,"" Jason said. He leaned against the wall and put his hand to the back of his head and looked at his palm. ""I thought I was bleeding,"" he said. ""I thought he hit me with that hatchet."" ""You hit your head on the rail,"" the man said. ""You better go on. They aint here."" ""Yes. He said they were not here. I thought he was lying."" ""Do you think I'm lying?"" the man said. ""No,"" Jason said. ""I know they're not here."" ""I told him to get the hell out of there, both of them,"" the man said. ""I wont have nothing like that in my show. I run a respectable show, with a respectable troupe."" ""Yes,"" Jason said. ""You dont know where they went?"" ""No. And I dont want to know. No member of my show can pull a stunt like that. You her ... brother?"" ""No,"" Jason said. ""It dont matter. I just wanted to see them. You sure he didn't hit me? No blood, I mean."" ""There would have been blood if I hadn't got there when I did. You stay away from here, now. That little bastard'll kill you. That your car yonder?"" ""Yes."" ""Well, you get in it and go back to Jefferson. If you find them, it wont be in my show. I run a respectable show. You say they robbed you?"" ""No,"" Jason said. ""It dont make any difference."" He went to the car and got in. What is it I must do? he thought. Then he remembered. He started the engine and drove slowly up the street until he found a drugstore. The door was locked. He stood for a while with his hand on the knob and his head bent a little. Then he turned away and when a man came along after a while he asked if there was a drugstore open anywhere, but there was not. Then he asked when the northbound train ran, and the man told him at two thirty. He crossed the pavement and got in the car again and sat there. After a while two negro lads passed. He called to them. ""Can either of you boys drive a car?"" ""Yes, suh."" ""What'll you charge to drive me to Jefferson right away?"" They looked at one another, murmuring.",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,122,"""I'll pay a dollar,"" Jason said. They murmured again. ""Couldn't go fer dat,"" one said. ""What will you go for?"" ""Kin you go?"" one said. ""I cant git off,"" the other said. ""Whyn't you drive him up dar? You aint got nothin to do."" ""Yes I is."" ""Whut you got to do?"" They murmured again, laughing. ""I'll give you two dollars,"" Jason said. ""Either of you."" ""I cant git away neither,"" the first said. ""All right,"" Jason said. ""Go on."" He sat there for some time. He heard a clock strike the half hour, then people began to pass, in Sunday and easter clothes. Some looked at him as they passed, at the man sitting quietly behind the wheel of a small car, with his invisible life ravelled out about him like a wornout sock, and went on. After a while a negro in overalls came up. ""Is you de one wants to go to Jefferson?"" he said. ""Yes,"" Jason said. ""What'll you charge me?"" ""Fo dollars."" ""Give you two."" ""Cant go fer no less'n fo."" The man in the car sat quietly. He wasn't even looking at him. The negro said, ""You want me er not?"" ""All right,"" Jason said. ""Get in. He moved over and the negro took the wheel. Jason closed his eyes. I can get something for it at Jefferson, he told himself, easing himself to the jolting, I can get something there. They drove on, along the streets where people were turning peacefully into houses and Sunday dinners, and on out of town. He thought that. He wasn't thinking of home, where Ben and Luster were eating cold dinner at the kitchen table. Something--the absence of disaster, threat, in any constant evil--permitted him to forget Jefferson as any place which he had ever seen before, where his life must resume itself. When Ben and Luster were done Dilsey sent them outdoors. ""And see kin you let him alone swell fo oclock. T. P. be here den."" ""Yessum,"" Luster said. They went out. Dilsey ate her dinner and cleared up the kitchen. Then she went to the foot of the stairs and listened, but there was no sound. She returned through the kitchen and out the outer door and stopped on the steps. Ben and Luster were not in sight, but while she stood there she heard another sluggish twang from the direction of the cellar door and she went to the door and looked down upon a repetition of the morning's scene. ""He done hit jes dat way,"" Luster said. He contemplated the motionless saw with a kind of hopeful dejection. ""I aint got de right thing to hit it wid yit,"" he said. ""En you aint gwine find hit down here, neither,"" Dilsey said. ""You take him on out in de sun. You bofe get pneumonia down here on dis wet flo."" She waited and watched them cross the yard toward a clump of cedar trees near the fence. Then she went on to her cabin. ""Now, dont you git started,"" Luster said. ""I had enough trouble wid you today."" There was a hammock made of barrel staves slatted into woven wires. Luster lay down in the swing, but Ben went on vaguely and purposelessly. He began to whimper again. ""Hush, now,"" Luster said. ""I fixin to whup you."" He lay back in the swing. Ben had stopped moving, but Luster could hear him whimpering. ""Is you gwine hush, er aint you?"" Luster said. He got up and followed and came upon Ben squatting before a small mound of earth. At either end of it an empty bottle of blue glass that once contained poison was fixed in the ground. In one was a withered stalk of jimson weed. Ben squatted before it, moaning, a slow, inarticulate sound. Still moaning he sought vaguely about and found a twig and put it in the other bottle. ""Whyn't you hush?"" Luster said. ""You want me to give you somethin to sho nough moan about? Sposin I does dis."" He knelt and swept the bottle suddenly up and behind him. Ben ceased moaning. He squatted, looking at the small depression where the bottle had sat, then as he drew his lungs full Luster brought the bottle back into view. ""Hush!"" he hissed. ""Dont you dast to beller! Dont you. Dar hit is. See? Here. You fixin to start ef you stays here. Come on, les go see ef dey started knockin ball yit."" He took Ben's arm and drew him up and they went to the fence and stood side by side there, peering between the matted honeysuckle not yet in bloom. ""Dar,"" Luster said. ""Dar come some. See um?"" They watched the foursome play onto the green and out, and move to the tee and drive.",no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,123,"Ben watched, whimpering, slobbering. When the foursome went on he followed along the fence, bobbing and moaning. One said, ""Here, caddie. Bring the bag."" ""Hush, Benjy,"" Luster said, but Ben went on at his shambling trot, clinging to the fence, wailing in his hoarse, hopeless voice. The man played and went on, Ben keeping pace with him until the fence turned at right angles, and he clung to the fence, watching the people move on and away. ""Will you hush now?"" Luster said. ""Will you hush now?"" He shook Ben's arm. Ben clung to the fence, wailing steadily and hoarsely. ""Aint you gwine stop?"" Luster said. ""Or is you?"" Ben gazed through the fence. ""All right, den,"" Luster said. ""You want somethin to belier about?"" He looked over his shoulder, toward the house. Then he whispered: ""Caddy! Beller now. ""Caddy! ""Caddy! ""Caddy! A moment later, in the slow intervals of Ben's voice, Luster heard Dilsey calling. He took Ben by the arm and they crossed the yard toward her. ""I tole you he warnt gwine stay quiet,"" Luster said. ""You vilyun!"" Dilsey said. ""Whut you done to him?"" ""I aint done nothin. I tole you when dem folks start playin, he git started up."" ""You come on here,"" Dilsey said. ""Hush, Benjy. Hush, now."" But he wouldn't hush. They crossed the yard quickly and went to the cabin and entered. ""Run git dat shoe,"" Dilsey said. ""Dont you sturb Miss Cahline, now. Ef she say anything, tell her I got him. Go on, now; you kin sho do dat right, I reckon."" Luster went out. Dilsey led Ben to the bed and drew him down beside her and she held him, rocking back and forth, wiping his drooling mouth upon the hem of her skirt. ""Hush, now,"" she said, stroking his head. ""Hush. Dilsey got you."" But he bellowed slowly, abjectly, without tears; the grave hopeless sound of all voiceless misery under the sun. Luster returned, carrying a white satin slipper. It was yellow now, and cracked, and soiled, and when they gave it into Ben's hand he hushed for a while. But he still whimpered, and soon he lifted his voice again. ""You reckon you kin find T. P.?"" Dilsey said. ""He say yistiddy he gwine out to St John's today. Say he be back at fo."" Dilsey rocked back and forth, stroking Ben's head. ""Dis long time, O Jesus,"" she said. ""Dis long time."" ""I kin drive dat surrey, mammy,"" Luster said. ""You kill bofe y'all,"" Dilsey said. ""You do hit fer devilment. I knows you got plenty sense to. But I cant trust you. Hush, now,"" she said. ""Hush. Hush."" ""Nome I wont,"" Luster said. ""I drives wid T. P."" Dilsey rocked back and forth, holding Ben. ""Miss Cahline say ef you cant quiet him, she gwine git up en come down en do hit."" ""Hush, honey,"" Dilsey said, stroking Ben's head. ""Luster, honey,"" she said. ""Will you think about yo ole mammy en drive dat surrey right?"" ""Yessum,"" Luster said. ""I drive hit jes like T. P."" Dilsey stroked Ben's head, rocking back and forth. ""I does de tees I kin,"" she said. ""Lewd knows dat. Go git it, den,"" she said, rising. Luster scuttled out. Ben held the slipper, crying. ""Hush, now. Luster gone to git de surrey en take you to de graveyard. We aint gwine risk gittin yo cap,"" she said. She went to a closet contrived of a calico curtain hung across a corner of the room and got the felt hat she had worn. ""We's down to worse'n dis, ef folks jes knowed,"" she said. ""You's de Lawd's chile anyway. En I be His'n too, fo long, praise Jesus. Here."" She put the hat on his head and buttoned his coat. He wailed steadily. She took the slipper from him and put it away and they went out. Luster came up, with an ancient white horse in a battered and lopsided surrey. ""You gwine be careful, Luster?"" she said. ""Yessum,"" Luster said. She helped Ben into the back seat. He had ceased crying, but now he began to whimper again. ""Hit's his flower,"" Luster said. ""Wait, I'll git him one."" ""You set right dar,"" Dilsey said. She went and took the cheekstrap. ""Now, hurry en git him one."" Luster ran around the house, toward the garden. He came back with a single narcissus. ""Dat un broke,"" Dilsey said. ""Whyn't you git him a good un?"" ""Hit de onliest one I could find,"" Luster said. ""Y'all took all of um Friday to dec'rate de church. Wait, I'll fix hit."" So while Dilsey held the horse Luster put a splint on the flower stalk with a twig and two bits of string and gave it to Ben. Then he mounted and took the",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,124,"reins. Dilsey still held the bridle. ""You knows de way now?"" she said. ""Up de street, round de square, to de graveyard, den straight back home."" ""Yessum,"" Luster said. ""Hum up, Queenie."" ""You gwine be careful, now?"" ""Yessum."" Dilsey released the bridle. ""Hum up, Queenie,"" Luster said. ""Here,"" Dilsey said. ""You hen me dat whup."" ""Aw, mammy,"" Luster said. ""Give hit here,"" Dilsey said, approaching the wheel. Luster gave it to her reluctantly. ""I wont never git Queenie started now."" ""Never you mind about dat,"" Dilsey said. ""Queenie know mo bout whar she gwine den you does. All you got to do es set dar en hold dem reins. You knows de way, now?"" ""Yessum. Same way T. P. goes ev'y Sunday."" ""Den you do de same thing dis Sunday."" ""Cose I is. Aint I drove fer T. P. mo'n a hund'ed times?"" ""Den do hit again,"" Dilsey said. ""G'awn, now. En ef you hurts Benjy, nigger boy, I dont know whut I do. You bound fer de chain gang, but I'll send you dar fo even chain gang ready fer you."" ""Yessum,"" Luster said. ""Hum up, Queenie."" He flapped the lines on Queenie's broad back and the surrey lurched into motion. ""You; Luster!"" Dilsey said. ""Hum up, dar!"" Luster said. He flapped the lines again. With subterranean rumblings Queenie jogged slowly down the drive and turned into the street, where Luster exhorted her into a gait resembling a prolonged and suspended fall in a forward direction. Ben quit whimpering. He sat in the middle of the seat, holding the repaired flower upright in his fist, his eyes serene and ineffable. Directly before him Luster's bullet head turned backward continually until the house passed from view, then he pulled to the side of the street and while Ben watched him he descended and broke a switch from a hedge. Queenie lowered her head and fell to cropping the grass until Luster mounted and hauled her head up and harried her into motion again, then he squared his elbows and with the switch and the reins held high he assumed a swaggering attitude out of all proportion to the sedate cropping of Queenie's hooves and the organlike basso of her internal accompaniment. Motors passed them, and pedestrians; once a group of half grown negroes: ""Dar Luster. Whar you gwine Luster? To de boneyard?"" ""Hi,"" Luster said. ""Aint de same boneyard y'all headed fen Hum up, elefump."" They approached the square, where the Confederate soldier gazed with empty eyes beneath his marble hand in wind and weather. Luster took still another notch in himself and gave the impervious Queenie a cut with the switch, casting his glance about the square. ""Dar Mr Jason car,"" he said, then he spied another group of negroes. ""Les show dem niggers how quality does, Benjy,"" he said. ""Whut you say?"" He looked back. Ben sat, holding the flower in his fist, his gaze empty and untroubled. Luster hit Queenie again and swung her to the left at the monument. For an instant Ben sat in an utter hiatus. Then he bellowed. Bellow on bellow, his voice mounted, with scarce interval for breath. There was more than astonishment in it, it was horror; shock; agony eyeless, tongueless; just sound, and Luster's eyes backrolling for a white instant. ""Gret God,"" he said. ""Hush! Hush! Gret God!"" He whirled again and struck Queenie with the switch. It broke and he cast it away and with Ben's voice mounting toward its unbelievable crescendo Luster caught up the end of the reins and leaned forward as Jason came jumping across the square and onto the step. With a backhanded blow he hurled Luster aside and caught the reins and sawed Queenie about and doubled the reins back and slashed her across the hips. He cut her again and again, into a plunging gallop, while Ben's hoarse agony roared about them, and swung her about to the right of the monument. Then he struck Luster over the head with his fist. ""Dont you know any better than to take him to the left?"" he said. He reached back and struck Ben, breaking the flower stalk again. ""Shut up!"" he said. ""Shut up!"" He jerked Queenie back and jumped down. ""Get to hell on home with him. If you ever cross that gate with him again, I'll kill you!"" ""Yes, suh!"" Luster said. He took the reins and hit Queenie with the end of them. ""Git up! Git up, dar! Benjy, fer God's sake!"" Ben's voice roared and roared. Queenie moved again, her feet began to clop-clop steadily again, and at once Ben hushed. Luster looked quickly back over his shoulder, then he drove on. The broken flower drooped over Ben's fist and his eyes were empty and blue and serene again as",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no

October 1928 APPENDIX Compson 1699-1945 IKKEMOTUBBE. A dispossessed American king. Called ""l'Homme"" (and sometimes ""de l'homme"") by his fosterbrother, a Chevalier of France, who had he not been born too late could have been among the brightest in that glittering galaxy of knightly blackguards who were Napoleon's marshals, who thus translated the Chickasaw title meaning ""The Man""; which translation Ikkemotubbe, himself a man of wit and imagination as well as a shrewd judge of character, including his own, carried one step further and anglicised it to ""Doom."" Who granted out of his vast lost domain a solid square mile of virgin North Mississippi dirt as truly angled as the four corners of a cardtable top (forested then because these were the old days before 1833 when the stars fell and Jefferson Mississippi was one long rambling onestorey mudchinked log building housing the Chickasaw Agent and his tradingpost store) to the grandson of a Scottish refugee who had lost his own birthright by casting his lot with a king who himself had been dispossessed. This in partial return for the right to proceed in peace, by whatever means he and his people saw fit, afoot or a horse provided they were Chickasaw horses, to the wild western land presently to be called Oklahoma: not knowing then about the oil. JACKSON. A Great White Father with a sword. (An old duellist, a brawling lean fierce mangy durable imperishable old lion who set the wellbeing of the nation above the White House and the health of his new political party above either and above them all set not his wife's honor but the principle that honor must be defended whether it was or not because defended it was whether or not.) Who patented sealed and countersigned the grant with his own hand in his gold tepee in Wassi Town, not knowing about the oil either: so that one day the homeless descendants of the dispossessed would ride supine with drink and splendidly comatose above the dusty allotted harborage of their bones in specially built scarletpainted hearses and fire-engines. These were Compsons: QUENTIN MACLACHAN. Son of a Glasgow printer, orphaned and raised by his mother's people in the Perth highlands. Fled to Carolina from Culloden Moor with a claymore and the tartan he wore by day and slept under by night, and little else. At eighty, having fought once against an English king and lost, he would not make that mistake twice and so fled again one night in 1779, with his infant grandson and the tartan (the claymore had vanished, along with his son, the grandson's father from one of Tarleton's regiments on a Georgia battlefield about a yea; ago) into Kentucky, where a neighbor named Boon or Boone had already established a settlement. CHARLES STUART. Attainted and proscribed by name and grade in his British regiment. Left for dead in a Georgia swamp by his own retreating army and then by the advancing American one, both of which were wrong. He still had the claymore even when on his homemade wooden leg he finally overtook his father and son four years later at Harrodsburg, Kentucky, just in time to bury the father and enter upon a long period of being a split personality while still trying to be the schoolteacher which he believed he wanted to be, until he gave up at last and became the gambler he actually was and which no Compson seemed to realize they all were provided the gambit was desperate and the odds long enough. Succeeded at last in risking not only his neck but the security of his family and the very integrity of the name he would leave behind him, by joining the confederation headed by an acquaintance named Wilkinson (a man of considerable talent and influence and intellect and power) in a plot to secede the whole Mississippi Valley from the United States and join it to Spain. Fled in his turn when the bubble burst (as anyone except a Compson schoolteacher should have known it would), himself unique in being the only one of the plotters who had to flee the country: this not from the vengeance and retribution of the government which he had attempted to dismember, but from the furious revulsion of his late confederates now frantic for their own safety. He was not expelled from the United States, he talked himself countryless, his expulsion due not to the treason but to his having been so vocal and vociferant in the conduct of it, burning each bridge vocally behind him before he had even reached the place to build the next one: so that",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,126,"it was no provost marshal nor even a civic agency but his late coplotters themselves who put afoot the movement to evict him from Kentucky and the United States and, if they had caught him, probably from the world too. Fled by night, running true to family tradition, with his son and the old claymore and the tartan. JASON LYCURGUS. Who, driven perhaps by the compulsion of the flamboyant name given him by the sardonic embittered woodenlegged indomitable father who perhaps still believed with his heart that what he wanted to be was a classicist schoolteacher, rode up the Natchez Trace one day in 1811 with a pair of fine pistols and one meagre saddlebag on a small lightwaisted but stronghocked mare which could do the first two furlongs in definitely under the halfminute and the next two in not appreciably more, though that was all. But it was enough: who reached the Chickasaw Agency at Okatoba (which in 1860 was still called Old Jefferson) and went no further. Who within six months was the Agent's clerk and within twelve his partner, officially still the clerk though actually halfowner of what was now a considerable store stocked with the mare's winnings in races against the horses of Ikkemotubbe's young men which he, Compson, was always careful to limit to a quarter or at most three furlongs, and in the next year it was Ikkemotubbe who owned the little mare and Compson owned the solid square mile of land which someday would be almost in the center of the town of Jefferson, forested then and still forested twenty years later though rather a park than a forest by that time, with its slavequarters and stables and kitchengardens and the formal lawns and promenades and pavilions laid out by the same architect who built the columned porticoed house furnished by steamboat from France and New Orleans, and still the square intact mile in 1840 (with not only the little white village called Jefferson beginning to enclose it but an entire white county about to surround it because in a few years now Ikkemotubbe's descendants and people would be gone, those remaining living not as warriors and hunters but as white men--as shiftless farmers or, here and there, the masters of what they too called plantations and the owners of shiftless slaves, a little dirtier than the white man, a little lazier, a little crueller--until at last even the wild blood itself would have vanished, to be seen only occasionally in the noseshape of a Negro on a cottonwagon or a white sawmill hand or trapper or locomotive fireman), known as the Compson Domain then, since now it was fit to breed princes, statesmen and generals and bishops, to avenge the dispossessed Compsons from Culloden and Carolina and Kentucky then known as the Governor's house because sure enough in time it did produce or at least spawn a governor--Quentin MacLachan again, after the Culloden grandfather--and still known as the Old Governor's even after it had spawned (1861) a general--(called so by predetermined accord and agreement by the whole town and county, as though they knew even then and beforehand that the old governor was the last Compson who would not fail at everything he touched save longevity or suicide)--the Brigadier Jason Lycurgus II who failed at Shiloh in '62 and failed again though not so badly at Resaca in '64, who put the first mortgage on the still intact square mile to a New England carpetbagger in '66, after the old town had been burned by the Federal General Smith and the new little town, in time to be populated mainly by the descendants not of Compsons but of Snopeses, had begun to encroach and then nibble at and into it as the failed brigadier spent the next forty years selling fragments of it off to keep up the mortgage on the remainder: until one day in 1900 he died quietly on an army cot in the hunting and fishing camp in the Tallahatchie River bottom where he passed most of the end of his days. And even the old governor was forgotten now; what was left of the old square mile was now known merely as the Compson place--the weedchoked traces of the old ruined lawns and promenades, the house which had needed painting too long already, the scaling columns of the portico where Jason III (bred for a lawyer and indeed he kept an office upstairs above the Square, where entombed in dusty filingcases some of the oldest names in the county--Holston and Sutpen, Grenier and Beauchamp and Coldfield--faded year by year among the bottomless labyrinths of chancery: and who knows what dream in the perennial heart of his father, now completing the third of his three avatars--the one as son",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,127,"of a brilliant and gallant statesman, the second as battleleader of brave and gallant men, the third as a sort of privileged pseudo-Daniel Boone- Robinson Crusoe, who had not returned to juvenility because actually he had never left it--that that lawyer's office might again be the anteroom to the governor's mansion and the old splendor) sat all day long with a decanter of whiskey and a litter of dogeared Horaces and Livys and Catulluses, composing (it was said) caustic and satiric eulogies on both his dead and his living fellowtownsmen, who sold the last of the property, except that fragment containing the house and the kitchengarden and the collapsing stables and one servant's cabin in which Dilsey's family lived, to a golfclub for the ready money with which his daughter Candace could have her fine wedding in April and his son Quentin could finish one year at Harvard and commit suicide in the following June of 1910, already known as the Old Compson place even while Compsons were still living in it on that spring dusk in 1928 when the old governor's doomed lost nameless seventeen-year-old greatgreatgranddaughter robbed her last remaining sane male relative (her uncle Jason IV) of his secret hoard of money and climbed down a rainpipe and ran off with a pitchman in a travelling streetshow, and still known as the Old Compson place long after all traces of Compsons were gone from it: after the widowed mother died and Jason IV, no longer needing to fear Dilsey now, committed his idiot brother, Benjamin, to the State Asylum in Jackson and sold the house to a countryman who operated it as a boarding house for juries and horse- and muletraders, and still known as the Old Compson place even after the boardinghouse (and presently the golfcourse too) had vanished and the old square mile was even intact again in row after row of small crowded jerrybuilt individuallyowned demiurban bungalows. And these: QUENTIN III. Who loved not his sister's body but some concept of Compson honor precariously and (he knew well) only temporarily supported by the minute fragile membrane of her maidenhead as a miniature replica of all the whole vast globy earth may be poised on the nose of a trained seal. Who loved not the idea of the incest which he would not commit, but some presbyterian concept of its eternal punishment: he, not God, could by that means cast himself and his sister both into hell, where he could guard her forever and keep her forevermore intact amid the eternal fires. But who loved death above all, who loved only death, loved and lived in a deliberate and almost perverted anticipation of death as a lover loves and deliberately refrains from the waiting willing friendly tender incredible body of-his beloved, until he can no longer bear not the refraining but the restraint and so flings, hurls himself relinquishing, drowning. Committed suicide in Cambridge Massachusetts, June 1910, two months after his sister's wedding, waiting first to complete the current academic year and so get the full value of his paid-in-advance tuition, not because he had his old Culloden and Carolina and Kentucky grandfathers in him but because the remaining piece of the old Compson mile which had been sold to pay for his sister's wedding and his year at Harvard had been the one thing, excepting that same sister and the sight of an open fire, which his youngest brother, born an idiot, had loved. CANDACE (CADDY). Doomed and knew it, accepted the doom without either seeking or fleeing it. Loved her brother despite him, loved not only him but loved in him that bitter prophet and inflexible corruptless judge of what he considered the family's honor and its doom, as he thought he loved but really hated in her what he considered the frail doomed vessel of its pride and the foul instrument of its disgrace, not only this, she loved him not only in spite of but because of the fact that he himself was incapable of love, accepting the fact that he must value above all not her but the virginity of which she was custodian and on which she placed no value whatever: the frail physical stricture which to her was no more than a hangnail would have been. Knew the brother loved death best of all and was not jealous, would (and perhaps in the calculation and deliberation of her marriage did) have handed him the hypothetical hemlock. Was two months pregnant with another man's child which regardless of what its sex would be she had already named Quentin after the brother whom they both (she and her brother) knew was already the same as dead, when she married (1910) an extremely eligible young Indianian she and her mother had met",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,128,"while vacationing at French Lick the summer before. Divorced by him 1911. Married 1920 to a minor movingpicture magnate, Hollywood California. Divorced by mutual agreement, Mexico 1925. Vanished in Paris with the German occupation, 1940, skill beautiful and probably still wealthy too since she did not look within fifteen years of her actual fortyeight, and was not heard of again. Except there was a woman in Jefferson, the county librarian, a mousesized and -colored woman who had never married who had passed through the city schools in the same class with Candace Compson and then spent the rest of her life trying to keep Forever Amber in its orderly overlapping avatars and Jurgen and Tom Jones out of the hands of the highschool juniors and seniors who could reach them down without even having to tip-toe from the back shelves where she herself would have to stand on a box to hide them. One day in 1943, after a week of a distraction bordering on disintegration almost, during which those entering the library would find her always in the act of hurriedly closing her desk drawer and turning the key in it (so that the matrons, wives of the bankers and doctors and lawyers, some of whom had also been in that old highschool class, who came and went in the afternoons with the copies of the Forever Ambers and the volumes of Thorne Smith carefully wrapped from view in sheets of Memphis and Jackson newspapers, believed she was on the verge of illness or perhaps even loss of mind) she closed and locked the library in the middle of the afternoon and with her handbag clasped tightly under her arm and two feverish spots of determination in her ordinarily colorless cheeks, she entered the farmers' supply store where Jason IV had started as a clerk and where he now owned his own business as a buyer of and dealer in cotton, striding on through that gloomy cavern which only men ever entered--a cavern cluttered and walled and stalagmitehung with plows and discs and loops of tracechain and singletrees and mulecollars and sidemeat and cheap shoes and horselinament and flour and molasses, gloomy because the goods it contained were not shown but hidden rather since those who supplied Mississippi farmers or at least Negro Mississippi farmers for a share of the crop did not wish, until that crop was made and its value approximately computable, to show them what they could learn to want but only to supply them on specific demand with what they could not help but need--and strode on back to Jason's particular domain in the rear: a railed enclosure cluttered with shelves and pigeonholes bearing spiked dust-and-lintgathering gin receipts and ledgers and cottonsamples and rank with the blended smell of cheese and kerosene and harnessoil and the tremendous iron stove against which chewed tobacco had been spat for almost a hundred years, and up to the long high sloping counter behind which Jason stood and, not looking again at the overalled men who had quietly stopped talking and even chewing when she entered, with a kind of fainting desperation she opened the handbag and fumbled something out of it and laid it open on the counter and stood trembling and breathing rapidly while Jason looked down at it--a picture, a photograph in color clipped obviously from a slick magazine--a picture filled with luxury and money and sunlight--a Cannebire backdrop of mountains and palms and cypresses and the sea, an open powerful expensive chromium/rimmed sports car, the woman's face hatless between a rich scarf and a seal coat, ageless and beautiful, cold serene and damned; beside her a handsome lean man of middleage in the ribbons and tabs of a German staffgeneral-- and the mousesized mousecolored spinster trembling and aghast at her own temerity, staring across it at the childless bachelor in whom ended that long line of men who had had something in them of decency and pride even after they had begun to fail at the integrity and the pride had become mostly vanity and selfpity: from the expatriate who had to flee his native land with little else except his life yet who still refused to accept defeat, through the man who gambled his life and his good name twice and lost twice and declined to accept that either, and the one who with only a clever small quarterhorse for tool avenged his dispossessed father and grandfather and gained a principality, and the brilliant and gallant governor and the general who though he failed at leading in battle brave and gallant men at least risked his own life too in the failing, to the cultured dipsomaniac who sold the last of his patrimony not to buy drink but to give one of his descendants",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
sound-and-fury,129,"at least the best chance in life he could think of. 'It's Caddy!' the librarian whispered. 'We must save her!' 'It's Cad, all right,' Jason said. Then he began to laugh. He stood there laughing above the picture, above the cold beautiful face now creased and dogeared from its week's sojourn in the desk drawer and the handbag. And the librarian knew why he was laughing, who had not called him anything but Mr Compson for thirty-two years now, ever since the day in 1911 when Candace, cast off by her husband, had brought her infant daughter home and left the child and departed by the next train, to return no more, and not only the Negro cook, Dilsey, but the librarian too divined by simple instinct that Jason was somehow using the child's life and its illegitimacy both to blackmail the mother not only into staying away from Jefferson for the rest of her life but into appointing him sole unchallengeable trustee of the money she would send for the child's maintenance, and had refused to speak to him at all since that day in 1928 when the daughter climbed down the rainpipe and ran away with the pitchman. 'Jason!' she cried. 'We must save her! Jason! Jason!'--and still crying it even when he took up the picture between thumb and finger and threw it back across the counter toward her. 'That Candace?' he said. 'Don't make me laugh. This bitch aint thirty yet. The other one's fifty now.' And the library was still locked all the next day too when at three oclock in the afternoon, footsore and spent yet still unflagging and still clasping the handbag tightly under her arm, she turned into a neat small yard in the Negro residence section of Memphis and mounted the steps of the neat small house and rang the bell and the door opened and a black woman of about her own age looked quietly out at her. 'It's Frony, isn't it?' the librarian said. 'Dont you remember me--Melissa Meek, from Jefferson--' 'Yes,' the Negress said. 'Come in. You want to see Mama.' And she entered the room, the neat yet cluttered bedroom of an old Negro, rank with the smell of old people, old women, old Negroes, where the old woman herself sat in a rocker beside the hearth where even though it was June a fire smoldered--a big woman once, in faded clean calico and an immaculate turban wound round her head above the bleared and now apparently almost sightless eyes--and put the dogeared clipping into the black hands which, like the women of her race, were still as supple and delicately shaped as they had been when she was thirty or twenty or even seventeen. 'It's Caddy!' the librarian said. 'It is! Dilsey! Dilsey!' 'What did he say?' the old Negress said. And the librarian knew whom she meant by 'he', nor did the librarian marvel, not only that the old Negress would know that she (the librarian) would know whom she meant by the 'he', but that the old Negress would know at once that she had already shown the picture to Jason. 'Dont you know what he said?' she cried. 'When he realised she was in danger, he said it was her, even if I hadn't even had a picture to show him. But as soon as he realised that somebody, anybody, even just me, wanted to save her, would try to save her, he said it wasn't. But it is! Look at it!' 'Look at my eyes,' the old Negress said. 'How can I see that picture?' 'Call Frony!' the librarian cried. 'She will know her!' But already the old Negress was folding the clipping carefully back into its old creases, handing it back. 'My eyes aint any good anymore,' she said. 'I cant see it.' And that was all. At six oclock she fought her way through the crowded bus terminal, the bag clutched under one arm and the return half of her roundtrip ticket in the other hand, and was swept out onto the roaring platform on the diurnal tide of a few middleaged civilians but mostly soldiers and sailors enroute either to leave or to death and the homeless young women, their companions, who for two years now had lived from day to day in pullmans and hotels when they were lucky and in daycoaches and busses and stations and lobbies and public restrooms when not, pausing only long enough to drop their foals in charity wards or policestations and then move on again, and fought her way into the bus, smaller than any other there so that her feet touched the floor only occasionally until a shape (a man in khaki; she couldn't see him at all because she was",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
sound-and-fury,130,"already crying) rose and picked her up bodily and set her into a seat next the window, where still crying quietly she could look out upon the fleeing city as it streaked past and then was behind and presently now she would be home again, safe in Jefferson where life lived too with all its incomprehensible passion and turmoil and grief and fury and despair, but here at six oclock you could close the covers on it and even the weightless hand of a child could put it back among its unfeatured kindred on the quiet eternal shelves and turn the key upon it for the whole and dreamless night. Yes she thought, crying quietly that was it she didn't want to see it know whether it was Caddy or not because she knows Caddy doesn't want to be saved hasn't anything anymore worth being saved for nothing worth being lost that she can lose JASON IV. The first sane Compson since before Culloden and (a childless bachelor) hence the last. Logical rational contained and even a philosopher in the old stoic tradition: thinking nothing whatever of God one way or the other and simply considering the police and so fearing and respecting only the Negro woman, his sworn enemy since his birth and his mortal one since that day in 1911 when she too divined by simple clairvoyance that he was somehow using his infant niece's illegitimacy to blackmail its mother, who cooked the food he ate. Who not only fended off end held his own with Compsons but competed and held his own with the Snopeses who took over the little town following the turn of the century as the Compsons and Sartorises and their ilk faded from it (no Snopes, but Jason Compson himself who as soon as his mother died--the niece had already climbed down the rainpipe and vanished so Dilsey no longer had either of these clubs to hold over him-- committed his idiot younger brother to the state and vacated the old house, first chopping up the vast oncesplendid rooms into what he called apartments and selling the whole thing to a countryman who opened a boardinghouse in it), though this was not difficult since to him all the rest of the town and the world and the human race too except himself were Compsons, inexplicable yet quite predictable in that they were in no sense whatever to be trusted. Who, all the money from the sale of the pasture having gone for his sister's wedding and his brother's course at Harvard, used his own niggard savings out of his meagre wages as a storeclerk to send himself to a Memphis school where he learned to class and grade cotton, and so established his own business with which, following his dipsomaniac father's death, he assumed the entire burden of the rotting family in the rotting house, supporting his idiot brother because of their mother, sacrificing what pleasures might have been the right and just due and even the necessity of a thirty-year-old bachelor, so that his mother's life might continue as nearly as possible to what it had been this not because he loved her but (a sane man always) simply because he was afraid of the Negro cook whom he could not even force to leave even when he tried to stop paying her weekly wages, and who despite all this, still managed to save almost three thousand dollars ($2840. 50) as he reported it on the night his niece stole it, in niggard and agonised dimes and quarters and halfdollars, which hoard he kept in no bank because to him a banker too was just one more Compson, but hid in a locked bureau drawer in his bedroom whose bed he made and changed himself since he kept the bedroom door locked all the time save when he was passing through it. Who, following a fumbling abortive attempt by his idiot brother on a passing female child, had himself appointed the idiot's guardian without letting their mother know and so was able to have the creature castrated before the mother even knew it was out of the house, and who following the mother's death in 1933 was able to free himself forever not only from the idiot brother and the house but from the Negro woman too, moving into a pair of offices up a flight of stairs above the supplystore containing his cotton ledgers and samples, which he had converted into a bedroom- kitchen-bath, in and out of which on weekends there would be seen a big plain friendly brazenhaired pleasantfaced woman no longer very young, in round picture hats and (in its season) an imitation fur coat, the two of them, the middleaged cottonbuyer and the woman whom the town",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
sound-and-fury,131,"called, simply, his friend from Memphis, seen at the local picture show on Saturday night and on Sunday morning mounting the apartment stairs with paper bags from the grocer's containing loaves and eggs and oranges and cans of soup, domestic, uxorious, connubial, until the late afternoon bus carried her back to Memphis. He was emancipated now. He was free. 'In 1865,' he would say, 'Abe Lincoln freed the niggers from the Compsons. In 1933, Jason Compson freed the Compsons from the niggers.' BENJAMIN. Born Maury, after his mother's only brother: a handsome flashing swaggering workless bachelor who borrowed money from almost anyone, even Dilsey although she was a Negro, explaining to her as he withdrew his hand from his pocket that she was not only in his eyes the same as a member of his sister's family, she would be considered a born lady anywhere in any eyes. Who, when at last even his mother realised what he was and insisted weeping that his name must be changed, was rechristened Benjamin by his brother Quentin (Benjamin, our lastborn, sold into Egypt). Who loved three things: the pasture which was sold to pay for Candace's wedding and to send Quentin to Harvard, his sister Candace, firelight.

The villa was famous for the fine view from its terrace. The hidden garden in which the four men sat at table lay some twenty feet below the south end of this terrace, and was a mere shelf of rock, overhanging a steep declivity planted with vineyards. A flight of stone steps connected it with the promenade above. The table stood in a sanded square, among potted orange and oleander trees, shaded by spreading ilex oaks that grew out of the rocks overhead. Beyond the balustrade was the drop into the air, and far below the landscape stretched soft and undulating; there was nothing to arrest the eye until it reached Rome itself. It was early when the Spanish Cardinal and his guests sat down to dinner. The sun was still good for PROLOGUE an hour of supreme splendour, and across the shining folds of country the low profile of the city barely fretted the sky-line indistinct except for the dome of St. Peters, bluish grey like the flattened top of a great balloon, just a flash of copper light on its soft metallic surface. The Cardinal had an eccentric preference for beginning his dinner at this time in the late afternoon, when the vehemence of the sun sug- gested motion. The light was full of action and had a peculiar quality of climax of splendid finish. It was both intense and soft, with a ruddiness as of much-multiplied candlelight, an aura of red in its flames. It bored into the ilex trees, illuminating their mahogany trunks and blurring their dark fo- liage; it warmed the bright green of the orange trees and the rose of the oleander blooms to gold; sent congested spiral patterns quivering over the damask and plate and crystal. The churchmen kept their rectangular clerical caps on their heads to protect them from the sun. The three Cardinals wore black cassocks with crimson pipings and crimson buttons, the Bishop a long black coat over his violet vest. They were talking business; had met, indeed, to discuss an anticipated appeal from the Provincial Council at Baltimore for the founding of an Apostolic Vicarate in New Mexico a part of North America recently annexed to the United States. This new territory was vague to all of them, even to the mis- 2 PROLOGUE sionary Bishop. The Italian and French Cardinals spoke of it as Le Mexique, and the Spanish host referred to it as New Spain. Their interest in the projected Vicarate was tepid, and had to be con- tinually revived by the missionary, Father Ferrand; Irish by birth, French by ancestry a man of wide wanderings and notable achievement in the New World, an Odysseus of the Church. The language spoken was French the time had already gone by when Cardinals could conveniently discuss contem- porary matters in Latin. The French and Italian Cardinals were men in vigorous middle life the Norman full-belted and ruddy, the Venetian spare and sallow and hook-nosed. Their host, Garcia Maria de Allande, was still a young man. He was dark in colouring, but the long Spanish face, that looked out from so many canvases in his ancestral portrait gallery, was in the young Cardinal much modified through his English mother. With his caff oscuro eyes, he had a fresh, pleasant English mouth, and an open manner. During the latter years of the reign of Gregory XVI, de Allande had been the most influential man at the Vatican; but since the death of Gregory, two years ago, he had retired to his country estate. He believed the",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,1,"reforms of the new Pontiff impractical and dangerous, and had withdrawn from politics, confining his activities to work for the Society for the 3 PROLOGUE Propagation of the Faith that organization which had been so fostered by Gregory. In his leisure the Cardinal played tennis. As a boy, in England, he had been passionately fond of this sport. Lawn ten- nis had not yet come into fashion; it was a formi- dable game of indoor tennis the Cardinal played. Amateurs of that violent sport came from Spain and France to try their skill against him. The missionary, Bishop Ferrand, looked much older than any of them, old and rough except for his clear, intensely blue eyes. His diocese lay within the icy arms of the Great Lakes, and on his long, lonely horseback rides among his missions the sharp winds had bitten him well. The missionary was here for a purpose, and he pressed his point. He ate more rapidly than the others and had plenty of time to plead his cause, finished each course with such dispatch that the Frenchman remarked he would have been an ideal dinner companion for Napoleon. The Bishop laughed and threw out his brown hands in apology. Likely enough I have forgot my man- ners. I am preoccupied. Here you can scarcely un- derstand what it means that the United States has annexed that enormous territory which was the cradle New of the Faith in the Mexico will be in a few years raised to an Episcopal See, with jurisdiction over a country larger than Central and Western Europe, barring Russia. The 4 New World. The Vicarate of PROLOGUE Bishop of that See will direct the beginning of by momentous things. Beginnings, murmured the Venetian, there have been so many. But nothing ever comes from over there but trouble and appeals for money. The missionary turned to him patiently. Your Eminence, I beg you to follow me. This country was evangelized in fifteen hundred, by the Franciscan Fathers. It has been allowed to drift for nearly three hundred years and is not yet dead. It still pitifully calls itself a Catholic country, and tries to keep the forms of religion without instruction. The old mission churches are in ruins. The few priests are without guidance or discipline. They are lax in religious observance, and some of them live in open concubi- nage. If this Augean stable is not cleansed, now that the territory has been taken over by a progressive government, it will prejudice the interests of the Church in the whole of North America. But these missions are still under the jurisdiction of Mexico, are they not? inquired the Frenchman. In the See of the Bishop of Durango? added Maria de Allande. The missionary sighed. Your Eminence, the Bishop of Durango is an old man; and from his seat to Santa F is a distance of fifteen hundred English miles. There are no wagon roads, no canals, no navigable rivers. Trade is carried on by means of 5 PROLOGUE pack-mules, over treacherous trails. The desert down there has a peculiar horror; I do not mean thirst, nor Indian massacres, which are frequent. The very floor of the world is cracked open into countless canyons and arroyos, fissures in the earth which are sometimes ten feet deep, sometimes a thousand. Up and down these stony chasms the traveller and his mules clamber as best they can. It is impossible to go far in any direction without crossing them. If the Bishop of Durango should summon a disobedient priest by letter, who shall bring the Padre to him? Who can prove that he ever received the summons? The post is carried by hunters, fur trappers, gold seekers, whoever happens to be moving on the trails. The Norman Cardinal emptied his glass and wiped his lips. And the inhabitants, Father Ferrand? If these are the travellers, who stays at home? Some thirty Indian nations, Monsignor, each with its own customs and language, many of them fiercely hostile to each other. And the Mexicans, a naturally devout people. Untaught and unshep- herded, they cling to the faith of their fathers. T have a letter from the Bishop of Durango, recommending his Vicar for this new post, remarked Maria de Allande. Your Eminence, it would be a great misfortune if a native priest were appointed; they have never 6 PROLOGUE done well in that field. Besides, this Vicar is old. The new Vicar must be a young man, of strong con- stitution, full of zeal, and above all, intelligent. He will have to deal with savagery and ignorance, with dissolute priests and political intrigue. He must be a man to whom order is necessary as dear as life. The Spaniards coffee-coloured eyes showed a glint of yellow as",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,2,"he glanced sidewise at his guest. T suspect, from your exordium, that you have a candidate and that he is a French priest, per- haps? You guess rightly, Monsignor. I am glad to see that we have the same opinion of French mission- aries. Yes, said the Cardinal lightly, they are the best missionaries. Our Spanish fathers made good martyrs, but the French Jesuits accomplish more. They are the great organizers. Better than the Germans? asked the Venetian, who had Austrian sympathies. Oh, the Germans classify, but the French arrange! The French missionaries have a sense of proportion and rational adjustment. They are always trying to discover the logical relation of things. It is a passion with them. Here the host turned to the old Bishop again. But your Grace, why do you neglect this Bur- gundy? I had this wine brought up from my cellar 7 PROLOGUE especially to warm away the chill of your twenty Canadian winters. Surely, you do not gather vintages like this on the shores of the Great Lake Huron? The missionary smiled as he took up his untouched glass. It is superb, your Eminence, but I fear I have lost my palate for vintages. Out there, a little whisky, or Hudson Bay Company rum, does better for us. I must confess I enjoyed the champagne in Paris. We had been forty days at sea, and I am a poor sailor. Then we must have some for you. He made a sign to his major-domo. You like it very cold? And your new Vicar Apostolic, what will he drink in the country of bison and serpents a sonnettes? And what will he eat? He will eat dried buffalo meat and frijoles with chili, and he will be glad to drink water when he can get it. He will have no easy life, your Eminence. That country will drink up his youth and strength as it does the rain. He will be called upon for every sacrifice, quite possibly for martyrdom. Only last year the Indian pueblo of San Fernandez de Taos murdered and scalped the American Governor and some dozen other whites. The reason they did not scalp their Padre, was that their Padre was one of the leaders of the rebellion and himself planned the massacre. That is how things stand in New Mexico! Where is your candidate at present, Father? 8 PROLOGUE He is a parish priest, on the shores of Lake On- tario, in my diocese. I have watched his work for nine years. He is but thirty-five now. He came to us directly from the Seminary. And his name is? Jean Marie Latour. Maria de Allande, leaning back in his chair, put the tips of his long fingers together and regarded them thoughtfully. Of course, Father Ferrand, the Propaganda will almost certainly appoint to this Vicarate the man whom the Council at Baltimore recommends. Ah yes, your Eminence; but a word from you to the Provincial Council, an inquiry, a suggestion Would have some weight, I admit, replied the Cardinal smiling. And this Latour is intelligent, you say? What a fate you are drawing upon him! But I suppose it is no worse than a life among the Hurons. My knowledge of your country is chiefly drawn from the romances of Fenimore Cooper, which I read in English with great pleasure. But has your priest a versatile intelligence? Any intelligence in matters of art, for example? And what need would he have for that, Mon- signor? Besides, he is from Auvergne. The three Cardinals broke into laughter and refilled their glasses. They were all becoming restive under the monotonous persistence of the missionary. 9 PROLOGUE Listen, said the host, and I will relate a little story, while the Bishop does me the compliment to drink my champagne. I have a reason for asking this question which you have answered so finally. In my family house in Valencia I have a number of pictures by the great Spanish painters, collected chiefly by my great-grandfather, who was a man of perception in these things and, for his time, rich. His collection of El Greco is, I believe, quite the best in Spain. When my progenitor was an old man, along came one of these missionary priests from New Spain, begging. All missionaries from the Americas were inveterate beggars, then as now, Bishop Fer- rand. This Franciscan had considerable success, with his tales of pious Indian converts and struggling missions. He came to visit at my great-grandfathers house and conducted devotions in the absence of the Chaplain. He wheedled a good sum of money out of the old man, as well as vestments and linen and chalices he would take anything and he im- plored my grandfather to give him a painting from his",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,3,"great collection, for the ornamentation of his mission church among the Indians. My grandfather told him to choose from the gallery, believing the priest would covet most what he himself could best afford to spare. But not at all; the hairy Franciscan pounced upon one of the best in the collection; a young St. Francis in meditation, by El Greco, and BK) PROLOGUE the model for the saint was one of the very handsome Dukes of Albuquerque. My grandfather protested; tried to persuade the fellow that some picture of the Crucifixion, or a martyrdom, would appeal more strongly to his redskins. What would a St. Francis, of almost feminine beauty, mean to the scalp-takers? All in vain. The missionary turned upon his host with a reply which has become a saying in our family: You refuse me this picture because it is a good picture. It is too good for God, but it is not too good for you. He carried off the painting. In my grandfathers manuscript catalogue, under the number and title of the St. Francis, is written: Given to Fray Teodocio, for the glory of God, to enrich his mission church at Pueblo de Cia, among the savages of New Spain. Tt is because of this lost treasure, Father Ferrand, that I happen to have had some personal correspond- ence with the Bishop of Durango. I once wrote the facts to him fully. He replied to me that the mission at Cia was long ago destroyed and its furnishings scattered. Of course the painting may have been ruined in a pillage or massacre. On the other hand, it may still be hidden away in some crumbling sacristy or smoky wigwam. If your French priest had a discerning eye, now, and were sent to this Vicarate, he might keep my El Greco in mind. The Bishop shook his head. No, I cant promise II PROLOGUE you I do not know. I have noticed that he is a man of severe and refined tastes, but he is very re- served. Down there the Indians do not dwell in wig- wams, your Eminence, he added gently. No matter, Father. I see your redskins through Fenimore Cooper, and I like them so. Now let us go to the terrace for our coffee and watch the evening come on. The Cardinal led his guests up the narrow stairway. The long gravelled terrace and its balustrade were blue as a lake in the dusky air. Both sun and shadows were gone. The folds of russet country were now violet. Waves of rose and gold throbbed up the sky from behind the dome of the Basilica. As the churchmen walked up and down the prom- enade, watching the stars come out, their talk touched upon many matters, but they avoided politics, as men are apt to do in dangerous times. Not a word was spoken of the Lombard war, in which the Popes position was so anomalous. They talked instead of a new opera by young Verdi, which was being sung in Venice; of the case of a Spanish dancing- girl who had lately become a religious and was said to be working miracles in Andalusia. In this conver- sation the missionary took no part, nor could he even follow it with much interest. He asked himself whether he had been on the frontier so long that he had quite lost his taste for the talk of clever men. 12 PROLOGUE But before they separated for the night Maria de Allande spoke a word in his ear, in English. Vou are distrait, Father Ferrand. Are you wishing to unmake your new Bishop already? It is too late. Jean Marie Latour am I right? 13 BOOS OLN Gs THE VICAR APOSTOLIC THE CRUCIFORM TREE NE afternoon in the autumn of 1851 a solitary horseman, followed by a pack-mule, was push- ing through an arid stretch of country somewhere in central New Mexico. He had lost his way, and was trying to get back to the trail, with only his compass and his sense of direction for guides. The difficulty was that the country in which he found himself was so featureless or rather, that it was crowded with features, all exactly alike. As far as he could see, on every side, the landscape was heaped up into mo- notonous red sand-hills, not much larger than hay- cocks, and very much the shape of haycocks. One could not have believed that in the number of square miles a man is able to sweep with the eye there could be so many uniform red hills. He had been riding among them since early morning, and the look of the country had no more changed than if he had stood 14 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC still. He must have",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,4,"travelled through thirty miles of these conical red hills, winding his way in the narrow cracks between them, and he had begun to think that he would never see anything else. They were so exactly like one another that he seemed to be wan- dering in some geometrical nightmare; flattened cones, they were, more the shape of Mexican ovens than haycocks yes, exactly the shape of Mexican ovens, red as brick-dust, and naked of vegetation except for small juniper trees. And the junipers, too, were the shape of Mexican ovens. Every conical hill was spotted with smaller cones of juniper, a uni- form yellowish green, as the hills were a uniform red. The hills thrust out of the ground so thickly that they seemed to be pushing each other, elbowing each other aside, tipping each other over. The blunted pyramid, repeated so many hundred times upon his retina and crowding down upon him in the heat, had confused the traveller, who was sensitive to the shape of things. Mais, cest fantastique! he muttered, closing his eyes to rest them from the intrusive omnipresence of the triangle. When he opened his eyes again, his glance imme- diately fell upon one juniper which differed in shape from the others. It was not a thick-growing cone, but a naked, twisted trunk, perhaps ten feet high, and at the top it parted into two lateral, flat-lying 15 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP branches, with a little crest of green in the centre, just above the cleavage. Living vegetation could not present more faithfully the form of the Cross. The traveller dismounted, drew from his pocket a much worn book, and baring his head, knelt at the foot of the cruciform tree. Under his buckskin riding-coat he wore a black vest and the cravat and collar of a churchman. A young priest, at his devotions; and a priest in a thousand, one knew at a glance. His bowed head was not that of an ordinary man, it was built for the seat of a fine intelligence. His brow was open, generous, re- flective, his features handsome and somewhat severe. There was a singular elegance about the hands below the fringed cuffs of the buckskin jacket. Everything showed him to be a man of gentle birth brave, sensitive, courteous. His manners, even when he was alone in the desert, were distinguished. He had a kind of courtesy toward himself, toward his beasts, toward the juniper tree before which he knelt, and the God whom he was addressing. His devotions lasted perhaps half an hour, and when he rose he looked refreshed. He began talking to his mare in halting Spanish, asking whether she agreed with him that it would be better to push on, weary as she was, in hope of finding the trail. He had no water left in his canteen, and the horses had had none since yesterday morning. They had made 16 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC a dry camp in these hills last night. The animals were almost at the end of their endurance, but they would not recuperate until they got water, and it seemed best to spend their last strength in searching for it. On a long caravan trip across Texas this man had had some experience of thirst, as the party with which he travelled was several times put on a meagre water ration for days together. But he had not suffered then as he did now. Since morning he had had a feeling of illness; the taste of fever in his mouth, and alarming seizures of vertigo. As these conical hills pressed closer and closer upon him, he began to wonder whether his long waylaring from the mountains of Auvergne were possibly to end here. He reminded himself of that cry, wrung from his Saviour on the Cross, Jai soif!? Of all our Lords physical sufferings, only one, T thirst, rose to His lips. Empowered by long training, the young priest blotted himself out of his own consciousness and meditated upon the anguish of his Lord. The Passion of Jesus became for him the only reality; the need of his own body was but a part of that conception. His mare stumbled, breaking his mood of con- templation. He was sorrier for his beasts than for himself. He, supposed to be the intelligence of the party, had got the poor animals into this interminable desert of ovens. He was afraid he had been absent- minded, had been pondering his problem instead of 17 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP heeding the way. His problem was how to recover a Bishopric. He was a Vicar Apostolic, lacking a Vicarate. He was thrust out; his flock would have none of him. The traveller was Jean Marie Latour, consecrated Vicar Apostolic of New Mexico",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,5,"and Bishop of Agathonica im partibus at Cincinnati a year ago and ever since then he had been trying to reach his Vicarate. No one in Cincinnati could tell him how to get to New Mexico no one had ever been there. Since young Father Latours arrival in America, a railroad had been built through from New York to Cincinnati; but there it ended. New Mexico lay in the middle of a dark continent. The Ohio merchants knew of two routes only. One was the Santa F trail from St. Louis, but at that time it was very dangerous because of Comanche Indian raids. His friends advised Father Latour to go down the river to New Orleans, thence by boat to Galveston, across Texas to San Antonio, and to wind up into New Mexico along the Rio Grande valley. This he had done, but with what misadventures! His steamer was wrecked and sunk in the Gal- veston harbour, and he had lost all his worldly pos- sessions except his books, which he saved at the risk of his life. He crossed Texas with a traders car- avan, and approaching San Antonio he was hurt in jumping from an overturning wagon, and had to lie 18 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC for three months in the crowded house of a poor Irish family, waiting for his injured leg to get strong. It was nearly a year aftef he had embarked upon the Mississippi that the young Bishop, at about the sunset hour of a summer afternoon, at last beheld the old settlement toward which he had been journey- ing so long: The wagon train had been going all day through a greasewood plain, when late in the after- noon the teamsters began shouting that over yonder was the Villa. Across the level, Father Latour could distinguish low brown shapes, like earthworks, lying at the base of wrinkled green mountains with bare tops, wave-like mountains, resembling billows beaten up from a flat sea by a heavy gale; and their green was of two colors aspen and evergreen, not intermingled but lying in solid areas of light and dark. As the wagons went forward and the sun sank lower, a sweep of red carnelian-coloured hills lying at the foot of the mountains came into view; they curved like two arms about a depression in the plain; and in that depression. was Santa F, at last! A thin, wavering adobe town... a green plaza... at one end a church with two earthen towers that rose high above the flatness. The long main street began at the church, the town seemed to flow from it like a stream from a spring. The church towers, and all the low adobe houses, were rose colour in that light; 7a 19 Z DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP little darker in tone than the amphitheatre of red hills behind; and periodically the plumes of pop- lars flashed like gracious accent marks, inclin- ing and recovering themselves in the wind. The young Bishop was not alone in the exaltation of that hour; beside him rode Father Joseph Vaillant, his boyhood friend, who had made this long pil- grimage with him and shared his dangers. The two rode into Santa F together, claiming it for the glory of God. How, then, had Father Latour come to be here in the sand-hills, many miles from his seat, unattended, far out of his way and with no knowledge of how to get back to it? On his arrival at Santa F, this was what had happned: The Mexican priests there had refused to recognize his authority. They disclaimed any knowl- edge of a Vicarate Apostolic, or a Bishop of Aga- thonica. They said they were under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Durango, and had received no instruc- tions to the contrary. If Father Latour was to be their Bishop, where were his credentials? A parch- ment and letters, he knew, had been sent to the Bishop of Durango, but these had evidently got no farther. There was no postal service in this part of the world; the quickest and surest way to commu- nicate with the Bishop of Durango was to go to him. 20 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC So, having travelled for nearly a year to reach Santa F, Father Latour left it after a few weeks, and set off alone on horse-back to ride down into Old Mexico and back, a journey of full three thousand miles. He had been warned that there were many trails leading off the Rio Grande road, and that a stranger might easily mistake his way. For the first few days he had been cautious and watchful. Then he must have grown careless and turned into some purely local trail. When he realized that he was astray, his",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,6,"canteen was already empty and his horses seemed too exhausted to retrace their steps. He had per- severed in this sandy track, which grew ever fainter, reasoning that it must lead somewhere. All at once Father Latour thought he felt a change in the body of;his mare. She lifted her head for the first time in a long while, and seemed to redistribute her weight upon her legs. The pack-mule behaved in a similar manner, and both quickened their pace. Was it possible they scented water? Nearly an hour went by, and then, winding be- tween two hills that were like all the hundreds they had passed, the two beasts whinnied simultaneously. Below them, in the midst of that wavy ocean of sand, was a green thread of verdure and a running stream. This ribbon in the desert seemed no wider than a man could throw a stone, and it was greener than anything Latour had ever seen, even in his own 21 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP greenest corner of the Old World. But for the quiver- ing of the hide on his mares neck and shoulders, he might have thought this a vision, a delusion of thirst. Running water, clover fields, cottonwoods, acacias, little adobe houses with brilliant gardens, a boy driving a flock of white goats toward the stream, that was what the young Bishop saw. A few moments later, when he was struggling with his horses, trying to keep them from overdrinking, a young girl with a black shawl over her head came running toward him. He thought he had never seen a kindlier face. Her greeting was that of a Christian. Ave Maria Purissima, Senor. Whence do you come? Blessed child, he replied in Spanish, I am a priest who has lost his way. I am famished for water. A priest? she cried, that is not possible! Yet I look at you, and it is true. Such a thing has never happened to us before; it must be in answer to my fathers prayers. Run, Pedro, and tell father and Salvatore. 22 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC HIDDEN WATER An hour later, as darkness came over the sand-hills, the young Bishop was seated at supper in the mother- house of this Mexican settlement which, he learned, was appropriately called Agua Secreta, Hidden Water. At the table with him were his host, an old man called Benito, the oldest son, and two grandsons. The old man was a widower, and his daughter, Josepha, the girl who had run to meet the Bishop at the stream, was his housekeeper. Their supper was a pot of frijoles cooked with meat, bread and goats milk, fresh cheese and ripe apples. From the moment he entered this room with its thick whitewashed adobe walls, Father Latour had felt a kind of peace about it. In its bareness and simplicity there was something comely, as there was about the serious girl who had placed their food be- fore them and who now stood in the shadows against the wall, her eager eyes fixed upon his face. He found himself very much at home with the four dark- headed men who sat beside him in the candle-light. Their manners were gentle, their voices low and agreeable. When he said grace before meat, the men had knelt on the floor beside the table. The grand- 23 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP father declared that the Blessed Virgin must have led the Bishop from his path and brought him here to bap- tize the children and to sanctify the marriages. Their settlement was little known, he said. They had no papers for their land and were afraid the Americans might take it away from them. There was no one in their settlement who could read or write. Salvatore, his oldest son, had gone all the way to Albuquerque to find a wife, and had married there. But the priest had charged him twenty pesos, and that was half of all he had saved to buy furniture and glass win- dows for his house. His brothers and cousins, discour- aged by his experience, had taken wives without the marriage sacrament. In answer to the Bishops questions, they told him the simple story of their lives. They had here all they needed to make them happy. They spun and wove from the fleece of their flocks, raised their own corn and wheat and tobacco, dried their plums and apricots for winter. Once a year the boys took the grain up to Albuquerque to have it ground, and bought such luxuries as sugar and coffee. They had bees, and when sugar was high they sweetened with honey. Benito did not know in what year his grandfather had settled here, coming from Chihuahua with all his goods in ox-carts. But",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,7,"it was soon after the time when the French killed their king. My grandfather had heard talk of that before he 24 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC left home, and used to tell us boys about it when he was an old man. Perhaps you have guessed that I am a French- man, said Father Latour. No, they had not, but they felt sure he was not an American. Jos, the elder grandson, had been watching the visitor uncertainly. He was a handsome boy, with a triangle of black hair hang- ing over his rather sullen eyes. He now spoke for the first time. They say at Albuquerque that now we are all Americans, but that is not true, Padre. I will never be an American. They are infidels. Not all, my son. I have lived among Americans in the north for ten years, and I found many devout Catholics. The young man shook his head. They destroyed our churches when they were fighting us, and stabled their horses in them. And now they will take our religion away from us. We want our own ways and our own religion. Father Latour began to tell them about his friendly relations with Protestants in Ohio, but they had not room in their minds for two ideas; there was one Church, and the rest of the world was infidel. One thing they could understand; that he had here in his saddle-bags his vestments, the altar stone, and all the equipment for celebrating the 25 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Mass; and that to-morrow morning, after Mass, he would hear confessions, baptize, and sanctify marriages. After supper Father Latour took up a candle and began to examine the holy images on the shelf over the fire-place. The wooden figures of the saints, found in even the poorest Mexican houses, always interested him. He had never yet seen two alike. These over Benitos fire-place had come in the ox- carts from Chihuahua nearly sixty years ago. They had been carved by some devout soul, and brightly painted, though the colours had softened with time, and they were dressed in cloth, like dolls. They were much more to his taste than the factory-made plaster images in his mission churches in Ohio more like the homely stone carvings on the front of old parish churches in Auvergne. The wooden Virgin was a sorrowing mother indeed, long and stiff and severe, very long from the neck to the waist, even longer from waist to feet, like some of the rigid mosaics of the Eastern Church. She was dressed in black, with a white apron, and a black reboso over her head, like a Mexican woman of the poor. At her right was St. Joseph, and at her left a fierce little equestrian figure, a saint wearing the costume of a Mexican ranchero, velvet trousers richly embroidered and wide at the ankle, velvet jacket and silk shirt, and a high- crowned, broad-brimmed Mexican sombrero. He was 26 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC attached to his fat horse by a wooden pivot driven through the saddle. The younger grandson saw the priests interest in this figure. That, he said, is my name saint, Santiago. Oh, yes; Santiago. He was a missionary, like me. In our country we call him St. Jacques, and he carries a staff and a wallet but here he would need a horse, surely. The boy looked at him in surprise. But he is the saint of horses. Isnt he that in your country? The Bishop shook his head. No. I know nothing about that. How is he the saint of horses? He blesses the mares and makes them fruitful. Even the Indians believe that. They know that if they neglect to pray to Santiago for a few years, the foals do not come right. A little later, after his devotions, the young Bishop lay down in Benitos deep feather-bed, thinking how different was this night from his anticipation of it. He had expected to make a dry camp in the wilder- ness, and to sleep under a juniper tree, like the Prophet, tormented by thirst. But here he lay in comfort and safety, with love for his fellow creatures flowing like peace about his heart. If Father Vaillant were here, he would say, A miracle; that the Holy Mother, to whom he had addressed himself before the cruciform tree, had led him hither. And it was a 27 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP miracle, Father Latour knew that. But his dear Joseph must always have the miracle very direct and spectacular, not with Nature, but against it. He would almost be able to tell the colour of the mantle Our Lady wore when She took the mare by the bridle back yonder among the junipers and led her out",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,8,"of the pathless sand-hills, as the angel led the ass on the Flight into Egypt. * * * In the late afternoon of the following day the Bishop was walking alone along the banks of the life- giving stream, reviewing in his mind the events of the morning. Benito and his daughter had made an altar before the sorrowful wooden Virgin, and placed upon it candles and flowers. Every soul in the village, except Salvatores sick wife, had come to the Mass. He had performed marriages and baptisms and heard confessions and confirmed until noon. Then came the christening feast. Jos had killed a kid the night be- fore, and immediately after her confirmation Josepha slipped away to help her sisters-in-law roast it. When Father Latour asked her to give him his por- tion without chili, the girl inquired whether it was more pious to eat it like that. He hastened to explain that Frenchmen, as a rule, do not like high seasoning, lest she should hereafter deprive herself of her favourite condiment. 28 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC After the feast the sleepy children were taken home, the men gathered in the plaza to smoke under the great cottonwood trees. The Bishop, feeling a need of solitude, had gone forth to walk, firmly refusing an escort. On his way he passed the earthen thrashing-floor, where these people beat out their grain and winnowed it in the wind, like the Children of Israel. He heard a frantic bleating behind him, and was overtaken by Pedro with the great flock of goats, indignant at their days confinement, and wild to be in the fringe of pasture along the hills. They leaped the stream like arrows speeding from the bow, and regarded the Bishop as they passed him with their mocking, humanly intelligent smile. The young bucks were light and elegant in figure, with their pointed chins and polished tilted horns. There was great variety in their faces, but in nearly all something supercilious and sardonic. The angoras had long silky hair of a dazzling whiteness. As they leaped through the sunlight they brought to mind the chapter in the Apocalypse, about the whiteness of them that were washed in the blood of the Lamb. The young Bishop smiled at his mixed theology. But though the goat had always been the symbol of pagan lewdness, he told himself that their fleece had warmed many a good Christian, and their rich milk nourished sickly children. About a mile above the village he came upon the Sin DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP water-head, a spring overhung by the sharp-leafed variety of cottonwood called water willow. All about it crowded the oven-shaped hills, nothing to hint of water until it rose miraculously out of the parched and thirsty sea of sand. Some subterranean stream found an outlet here, was released from darkness. The result was grass and trees and flowers and human life; household order and hearths from which the smoke of burning pifion logs rose like incense to Heaven. The Bishop sat a long time by the spring, while the declining sun poured its beautifying light over those low, rose-tinted houses and bright gardens. The old grandfather had shown him arrow-heads and cor- roded medals, and a sword hilt, evidently Spanish, that he had found in the earth near the water-head. This spot had been a refuge for humanity long before these Mexicans had come upon it. It was older than history, like those well-heads in his own coun- try where the Roman settlers had set up the image. of a river goddess, and later the Christian priests had planted a cross. This settlement was his Bishop- ric in miniature; hundreds of square miles of thirsty desert, then a spring, a village, old men trying to remember their catechism to teach their grand- children. The Faith planted by the Spanish friars and watered with their blood was not dead; it awaited only the toil of the husbandman. He was not 30 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC troubled about the revolt in Santa F, or the power- ful old native priest who led it Father Martinez, of Taos, who had ridden over from his parish ex- pressly to receive the new Vicar and to drive him away. He was rather terrifying, that old priest, with his big head, violent Spanish face, and shoul- ders like a buffalo; but the day of his tyranny was almost over. 3 THE BISHOP CHEZ LUI I t was the late afternoon of Christmas Day, and the Bishop sat at his desk writing letters. Since his return to Santa F his official correspondence had been heavy; but the closely-written sheets over which he bent with a thoughtful smile were not to go to Monsignori, or to Archbishops, or to the heads of religious houses,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,9,"but to France, to Auvergne, to his own little town; to a certain grey, winding street, paved with cobbles and shaded by tall chest- nuts on which, even to-day, some few brown leaves would be clinging, or dropping one by one, to be caught in the cold green ivy on the walls. eM DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP The Bishop had returned from his long horseback trip into Mexico only nine days ago. At Durango the old Mexican prelate there had, after some delay, delivered to him the documents that defined his Vicarate, and Father Latour rode back the fifteen hundred miles to Santa F through the sunny days of early winter. On his arrival he found amity in- stead of enmity awaiting him. Father Vaillant had already endeared himself to the people. The Mexican priest who was in charge of the pro-cathedral had gracefully retired gone to visit his family in Old Mexico, and carried his effects along with him. Father Vaillant had taken possession of the priests house, and with the help of carpenters and the Mexican women of the parish had put it in order. The Yankee traders and the military Commandant at Fort Marcy had sent generous contributions of bedding and blankets and odd pieces of furniture. The Episcopal residence was an old adobe house, much out of repair, but with possibilities of comfort. Father Latour had chosen for his study a room at one end of the wing. There he sat, as this afternoon of Christmas Day faded into evening. It was a long room of an agreeable shape. The thick clay walls had been finished on the inside by the deft palms of Indian women, and had that irregular and intimate quality of things made entirely by the human hand. There was a reassuring solidity and depth about those 32 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC walls, rounded at door-sills and window-sills, rounded in wide wings about the corner fire-place. The in- terior had been newly whitewashed in the Bishops absence, and the flicker of the fire threw a rosy glow over the wavy surfaces, never quite evenly flat, never a dead white, for the ruddy colour of the clay un- derneath gave a warm tone to the lime wash. The ceiling was made of heavy cedar beams, overlaid by aspen saplings, all of one size, lying close together like the ribs in corduroy and clad in their ruddy inner skins. The earth floor was covered with thick Indian blankets; two blankets, very old, and beau- tiful in design and colour, were hung on the walls like tapestries. On either side of the fire-place plastered recesses were let into the wall. In one, narrow and arched, stood the Bishops crucifix. The other was square, with a carved wooden door, like a grill, and within it lay a few rare and beautiful books. The rest of the Bishops library was on open shelves at one end of the room. The furniture of the house Father Vaillant had bought from the departed Mexican priest. It was heavy and somewhat clumsy, but not unsightly. All the wood used in making tables and bedsteads was hewn from tree boles with the ax or hatchet. Even the thick planks on which the Bishops the- ological books rested were ax-dressed. There was not 6) DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP at that time a turning-lathe or a saw-mill in all northern New Mexico. The native carpenters whit- tled out chair rungs and table legs, and fitted them together with wooden pins instead of iron nails. Wooden chests were used in place of dressers with drawers, and sometimes these were beautifully carved, or covered with decorated leather. The desk at which the Bishop sat writing was an importation, a walnut secretary of American make (sent down by one of the officers of the Fort at Father Vaillants suggestion). His silver candlesticks he had brought from France long ago. They were given to him by a beloved aunt when he was ordained. The young Bishops pen flew over the paper, leav- ing a trail of fine, finished French script behind, in violet ink. My new study, dear brother, as I write, is full of the delicious fragrance of the pifon logs burning in my fire-place. (We use this kind of cedar-wood altogether for fuel, and it is highly aromatic, yet delicate. At our meanest tasks we have a perpetual odour of incense about us.) I wish that you, and my dear sister, could look in upon this scene of comfort and peace. We missionaries wear a frock-coat and wide-brimmed hat all day, you know, and look like American traders. What a pleasure to come home at night and put on my old cassock! I feel more like a priest then for so much of the day",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,10,"I must be a 34 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC business man! and, for some reason, more like a Frenchman. All day I am an American in speech and thought yes, in heart, too. The kindness of the American traders, and especially of the military officers at the Fort, commands more than a super- ficial loyalty. I mean to help the officers at their task here. I can assist them more than they realize. The Church can do more than the Fort to make these poor Mexicans good Americans. And it is for the peoples good; there is no other way in which they can better their condition. But this is not the day to write you of my duties or my purposes. To-night we are exiles, happy ones, thinking of home. Father Joseph has sent away our Mexican woman, he will make a good cook of her in time, but to-night he is preparing our Christmas dinner himself. I had thought he would be worn out to-day, for he has been conducting a Novena of High Masses, as is the custom here before Christmas. After the Novena, and the midnight Mass last night, I supposed he would be willing to rest to-day; but not a bit of it. You know his motto, Rest in action. I brought him a bottle of olive-oil on my horse all the way from Durango (I say olive-oil, because here oil? means something to grease the wheels of wagons!), and he is making some sort of cooked salad. We have no green vegetables here in winter, and no one seems ever to have heard of that blessed 35 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP plant, the lettuce. Joseph finds it hard to do without salad-oil, he always had it in Ohio, though it was a great extravagance. He has been in the kitchen all afternoon. There is only an open fire-place for cook- ing, and an earthen roasting-oven out in the court- yard. But he has never failed me in anything yet; and J think I can promise you that to-night two Frenchmen will sit down to a good dinner and drink your health. The Bishop laid down his pen and lit his two can- dles with a splinter from the fire, then stood dusting his fingers by the deep-set window, looking out at the pale blue darkening sky. The evening-star hung above the amber afterglow, so soft, so brilliant that she seemed to bathe in her own silver light. Ave Maris Stella, the song which one of his friends at the Seminary used to intone so beautifully; humming it softly he returned to his desk and was just dipping his pen in the ink when the door opened, and a voice said, Monseigneur est apporter les bougies. servi! Alors, Jean, veux-tu The Bishop carried the candles into the dining- room, where the table was laid and Father Vaillant was changing his cooks apron for his cassock. Crim- son from standing over an open fire, his rugged face was even homelier than usual though one of the first things a stranger decided upon meeting Father 36 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC Joseph was that the Lord had made few uglier men. He was short, skinny, bow-legged from a life on horseback, and his countenance had little to recom- mend it but kindliness and vivacity. He looked old, though he was then about forty. His skin was hard- ened and seamed by exposure to weather in a bitter climate, his neck scrawny and wrinkled like an old mans. A bold, blunt-tipped nose, positive chin, a very large mouth, the lips thick and succulent but never loose, never relaxed, always stiffened by effort or working with excitement. His hair, sunburned to the shade of dry hay, had originally been tow- coloured; Blanchet? (Whitey) he was always called at the Seminary. Even his eyes were near- sighted, and of such a pale, watery blue as to be unimpressive. There was certainly nothing in his outer case to suggest the fierceness and fortitude and fire of the man, and yet even the thick-blooded Mexican half-breeds knew his quality at once. If the Bishop returned to find Santa F friendly to him, it was because everybody believed in Father Vaillant homely, real, persistent, with the driving power of a dozen men in his poorly built body. On coming into the dining-room, Bishop Latour placed his candlesticks over the fire-place, since there were already six upon the table, illuminating the brown soup-pot. After they had stood for a moment in prayer, Father Joseph lifted the cover and ladled 37 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP the soup into the plates, a dark onion soup with croutons. The Bishop tasted it critically and smiled at his companion. After the spoon had travelled to his lips a few",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,11,"times, he put it down and leaning back in his chair remarked, Think of it, Blanchet; in all this vast country between the Mississippi and the Pacific Ocean, there is probably not another human being who could make a soup like this. Not unless he is a Frenchman, said Father Jo- seph. He had tucked a napkin over the front of his cassock and was losing no time in reflection. T am not deprecating your individual talent, Joseph, the Bishop continued, but, when one thinks of it, a soup like this is not the work of one man. It is the result of a constantly refined tradition. There are nearly a thousand years of history in this soup. Father Joseph frowned intently at the earthen pot in the middle of the table. His pale, near-sighted eyes had always the look of peering into distance. Cest ga, cest vrai, he murmured. But how, he exclaimed as he filled the Bishops plate again, how can a man make a proper soup without leeks, that king of vegetables? We cannot go on eating onions for ever. After carrying away the soupire, he brought in the roast chicken and pommes sautes. And salad, Jean, he continued as he began to carve. Are we 38 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC to eat dried beans and roots for the rest of our lives? Surely we must find time to make a garden. Ah, my garden at Sandusky! And you could snatch me away from it! You will admit that you never ate better lettuces in France. And my vineyard; a natural habitat for the vine, that. I tell you, the shores of Lake Erie will be covered with vineyards one day. I envy the man who is drinking my wine. Ah well, that is a missionarys life; to plant where another shall reap. As this was Christmas Day, the two friends were speaking in their native tongue. For years they had made it a practice to speak English together, except upon very special occasions, and of late they con- versed in Spanish, in which they both needed to gain fluency. And yet sometimes you used to chafe a little at your dear Sandusky and its comforts, the Bishop reminded him to say that you would end a home-staying parish priest, after all. Of course, one wants to eat ones cake and have it, as they say in Ohio. But no farther, Jean. This is far enough. Do not drag me any farther. Father Joseph began gently to coax the cork from a bottle of red wine with his fingers. This I begged for your dinner at the hacienda where I went to baptize the baby on St. Thomass Day. It is not easy to separate these rich Mexicans from their French wine. They know 39 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP its worth.? He poured a few drops and tried it. A slight taste of the cork; they do not know how to keep it properly. However, it is quite good enough for missionaries. Vou ask me not to drag you any farther, Joseph. I wish, Bishop Latour leaned back in his chair and locked his hands together beneath his chin, I wish I knew how far this is! Does anyone know the extent of this diocese, or of this territory? The Comman- dant at the Fort seems as much in the dark as I. He says I can get some information from the scout, Kit Carson, who lives at Taos. Dont begin worrying about the diocese, Jean. For the present, Santa F is the diocese. Establish order at home. To-morrow I will have a reckoning with the churchwardens, who allowed that band of drunken cowboys to come in to the midnight Mass and defile the font. There is enough to do here. Festina lenie. I have made a resolve not to go more than three days journey from Santa F for one year. The Bishop smiled and shook his head. And when you were at the Seminary, you made a resolve to lead a life of contemplation. A light leaped into Father Josephs homely face. T have not yet renounced that hope. One day you will release me, and I will return to some religious house in France and end my days in devotion to the Holy Mother. For the time being, it is my destiny 4o THE VICAR APOSTOLIC to serve Her in action. But this is far enough, Jean. The Bishop again shook his head and murmured, Who knows how far? The wiry little priest whose life was to be a suc- cession of mountain ranges, pathless deserts, yawn- ing canyons and swollen rivers, who was to carry the Cross into territories yet unknown and unnamed, who would wear down mules and horses and scouts and",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,12,"stage-drivers, to-night looked apprehensively at his superior and repeated, No more, Jean. This is - far enough. Then making haste to change the sub- ject, he said briskly, A bean salad was the best I could do for you; but with onion, and just a suspicion of salt pork, it is not so bad. Over the compote of dried plums they fell to talk- ing of the great yellow ones that grew in the old Latour garden at home. Their thoughts met in that tilted cobble street, winding down a hill, with the uneven garden walls and tall horse-chestnuts on either side; a lonely street after nightfall, with soft street lamps shaped like lanterns at the darkest turnings. At the end of it was the church where the Bishop made his first Communion, with a grove of flat-cut plane trees in front, under which the market was held on Tuesdays and Fridays. While they lingered over these memories an indulgence they seldom permitted themselves Al DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP the two missionaries were startled by a volley of rifle-shots and blood-curdling yells without, and the galloping of horses. The Bishop half rose, but Father Joseph reassured him with a shrug. Do not discompose yourself. The same thing happened here on the eve of All Souls Day. A band of drunken cowboys, like those who came into the church last night, go out to the pueblo and get the Tesuque Indian boys drunk, and then they ride in to serenade the soldiers at the Fort in this manner. 4 A BELL AND A MIRACLE On the morning after the Bishops return from Durango, after his first night in his Episcopal residence, he had a pleasant awakening from sleep. He had ridden into the courtyard after nightfall, having changed horses at a rancho and pushed on nearly sixty miles in order to reach home. Conse- quently he slept late the next morning did not awaken until six oclock, when he heard the Angelus ringing. He recovered consciousness slowly, unwilling to let go of a pleasing delusion that he was in Rome. 42 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC Still half believing that he was lodged near St. John Lateran, he yet heard every stroke of the Ave Maria bell, marvelling to hear it rung correctly (nine quick strokes in all, divided into threes, with an interval between); and from a bell with beautiful tone. Full, clear, with something bland and suave, each note floated through the air like a globe of silver. Before the nine strokes were done Rome faded, and behind it he sensed something Eastern, with palm trees, Jerusalem, perhaps, though he had never been there. Keeping his eyes closed, he cherished for a moment this sudden, pervasive sense of the East. Once before he had been carried out of the body thus to a place far away. It had happened in a street in New Orleans. He had turned a corner and come upon an old woman with a basket of yellow flowers; sprays of yellow sending out a honey-sweet perfume. Mimosa but before he could think of the name he was overcome by a feeling of place, was dropped, cassock and all, into a garden in the south of France where he had been sent one winter in his childhood to recover from an illness. And now this silvery bell note had carried him farther and faster than sound could travel. When he joined Father Vaillant at coffee, that impetuous man who could never keep a_ secret asked him anxiously whether he had heard anything. T thought I heard the Angelus, Father Joseph, 43 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP but my reason tells me that only a long sea voyage could bring me within sound of such a bell. Not at all, said Father Joseph briskly. I found that remarkable bell here, in the basement of old San Miguel. They tell me it has been here a hundred years or more. There is no church tower in the place strong enough to hold it it is very thick and must weigh close upon eight hundred pounds. But I had a scaffolding built in the churchyard, and with the help of oxen we raised it and got it swung on cross- beams. I taught a Mexican boy to ring it properly against your return. But how could it have come here? It is Spanish, I suppose? Yes, the inscription is in Spanish, to St. Joseph, and the date is 1356. It must have been brought up from Mexico City in an ox-cart. A heroic undertaking, certainly. Nobody knows where it was cast. But they do tell a story about it: that it was pledged to St. Joseph in the wars with the Moors, and that the people of some besieged city",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,13,"brought all their plate and silver and gold ornaments and threw them in with the baser metals. There is certainly a good deal of silver in the bell, nothing else would account for its tone. Father Latour reflected. And the silver of the Spaniards was really Moorish, was it not? If not actually of Moorish make, copied from their design. 44 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC The Spaniards knew nothing about working silver except as they learned it from the Moors. What are you doing, Jean? Trying to make my bell out an infidel? Father Joseph asked impatiently. The Bishop smiled. I am trying to account for the fact that when I heard it this morning it struck me at once as something oriental. A learned Scotch Jesuit in Montreal told me that our first bells, and the introduction of the bell in the service all over Europe, originally came from the East. He said the Templars brought the Angelus back from the Cru- sades, and it is really an adaptation of a Moslem custom. Father Vaillant sniffed. I notice that scholars always manage to dig out something belittling, he complained. Belittling? I should say the reverse. I am glad to think there is Moorish silver in your bell. When we first came here, the one good workman we found in Santa F was a silversmith. The Spaniards handed on their skill to the Mexicans, and the Mexicans have taught the Navajos to work silver; but it all came from the Moors. T am no scholar, as you know, said Father Vail- lant rising. And this morning we have many practi- cal affairs to occupy us. I have promised that you will give an audience to a good old man, a native priest from the Indian mission at Santa Clara, who is 45 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP returning from Mexico. He has just been on a pil- grimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Guadaloupe and has been much edified. He would like to tell you the story of his experience. It seems that ever since he was ordained he has desired to visit the shrine. During your absence I have found how particularly precious is that shrine to all Catholics in New Mex- ico. They regard it as the one absolutely authenticated appearance of the Blessed Virgin in the New World, and a witness of Her affection for Her Church on this continent. The Bishop went into his study, and Father Vaillant brought in Padre Escolastico Herrera, a man of nearly seventy, who had been forty years in the ministry, and had just accomplished the pious desire of a lifetime. His mind was still full of the sweetness of his late experience. He was so rapt that nothing else interested him. He asked anxiously whether perhaps the Bishop would have more leisure to attend to him later in the day. But Father Latour placed a chair for him and told him to proceed. The old man thanked him for the privilege of being seated. Leaning forward, with his hands locked between his knees, he told the whole story of the miraculous appearance, both because it was so dear to his heart, and because he was sure that no American Bishop would have heard of the occurrence as it was, though at Rome all the 46 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC details were well known and two Popes had sent gifts to the shrine. On Saturday, December goth, in the year 1531, a poor neophyte of the monastery of St. James was hurrying down Tapeyac hill to attend Mass in the City of Mexico. His name was Juan Diego and he was fifty-five years old. When he was half way down the hill a light shone in his path, and the Mother of God appeared to him as a young woman of great beauty, clad in blue and gold. She greeted him by name and said: Juan, seek out thy Bishop and bid him build a church in my honour on the spot where I now stand. Go then, and I will bide here and await thy return. Brother Juan ran into the City and straight to the Bishops palace, where he reported the matter. The Bishop was Zumarraga, a Spaniard. He ques- tioned the monk severely and told him he should have required a sign of the Lady to assure him that she was indeed the Mother of God and not some evil spirit. He dismissed the poor brother harshly and set an attendant to watch his actions. Juan went forth very downcast and repaired to the house of his uncle, Bernardino, who was sick of a fever. The two succeeding days he spent in caring for this aged man who seemed at the point of death. Because of the Bishops",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,14,"reproof he had fallen into 47 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP doubt, and did not return to the spot where the Lady said She would await him. On Tuesday he left the City to go back to his monastery to fetch medi- cines for Bernardino, but he avoided the place where he had seen the vision and went by another way. Again he saw a light in his path and the Virgin appeared to him as before, saying, Juan, why goest thou by this way? Weeping, he told Her that the Bishop had dis- trusted his report, and that he had been employed in caring for his uncle, who was sick unto death. The Lady spoke to him with all comfort, telling him that his uncle would be healed within the hour, and that he should return to Bishop Zumarraga and bid him build a church where She had first appeared to him. It must be called the shrine of Our Lady of Guadaloupe, after Her dear shrine of that name in Spain. When Brother Juan replied to Her that the Bishop required a sign, She said: Go up on the rocks yonder, and gather roses. Though it was December and not the season for roses, he ran up among the rocks and found such roses as he had never seen before. He gathered them until he had filled his t/ma. The tilma was a mantle worn only by the very poor, a wretched garment loosely woven of coarse vegetable fibre and sewn down the middle. When he returned to the appari- tion, She bent over the flowers and took pains to 48 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC arrange them, then closed the ends of the uma together and said to him: Go now, and do not open your mantle until you open it before your Bishop. Juan sped into the City and gained admission to the Bishop, who was in council with his Vicar. Vour Grace, he said, the Blessed Lady who appeared to me has sent you these roses for a sign. At this he held up one end of his /ma and let the roses fall in profusion to the floor. To his astonish- ment, Bishop Zumarraga and his Vicar instantly fell upon their knees among the flowers. On the in- side of his poor mantle was a painting of the Blessed Virgin, in robes of blue and rose and gold, exactly as She had appeared to him upon the hill-side. A shrine was built to contain this miraculous portrait, which since that day has been the goal of countless pilgrimages and has performed many miracles. Of this picture Padre Escolastico had much to say: he affirmed that it was of marvellous beauty, rich with gold, and the colours as pure and delicate as the tints of early morning. Many painters had visited the shrine and marvelled that paint could be laid at all upon such poor and coarse material. In the ordi- nary way of nature, the flimsy mantle would have fallen to pieces long ago. The Padre modestly pre- 49 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP sented Bishop Latour and Father Joseph with little medals he had brought from the shrine; on one side a relief of the miraculous portrait, on the other an inscription: Non fecit taliter omni nationi. (She hath not dealt so with any nation.) Father Vaillant was deeply stirred by the priests recital, and after the old man had gone he declared to the Bishop that he meant himself to make a pil- grimage to this shrine at the earliest opportunity. What.a priceless thing for the poor converts of a savage country! he exclaimed, wiping his glasses, which were clouded by his strong feeling. All these poor Catholics who have been so long without in- struction have at least the reassurance of that visitation. It is a household word with them that their Blessed Mother revealed Herself in their own country, to a poor convert. Doctrine is well enough for the wise, Jean; but the miracle is something we can hold in our hands and love. Father Vaillant began pacing restlessly up and down as he spoke, and the Bishop watched him, musing. It was just this in his friend that was dear to him. Where there is great love there are always miracles, he said at length. One might almost say that an apparition is human vision corrected by di- vine love. I do not see you as you really are, Joseph; I see you through my affection for you. The Miracles of the Church seem to me to rest not so much upon 50 THE VICAR APOSTOLIC faces or voices or healing power coming suddenly near to us from afar off, but upon our perceptions being made finer, so that for a",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,15,"moment our eyes can see and our ears can hear what is there about us always. or BOO K TWO MISSIONARY FOURNEYS I THE WHITE MULES N mid-March, Father Vaillant was on the road, returning from a missionary journey to Albu- querque. He was to stop at the rancho of a rich Mexican, Manuel Lujon, to marry his men and maid servants who were living in concubinage, and to baptize the children. There he would spend the night. . To-morrow or the day after he would go on to Santa F, halting by the way at the Indian pueblo of Santo Domingo to hold service. There was a fine old mission church at Santo Domingo, but the Indians were of a haughty and suspicious disposition. He had said Mass there on his way to Albuquerque, nearly a week ago. By dint of canvassing from house to house, and offering medals and religious colour prints to all who came to church, he had got together a consider- able congregation. It was a large and prosperous pueblo, set among clean sand-hills, with its rich 52 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS irrigated farm lands lying just below, in the valley of the Rio Grande. His congregation was quiet, dignified, attentive. They sat on the earth floor, wrapped in their best blankets, repose in every line of their strong, stubborn backs. He harangued them in such Spanish as he could command, and they lis- tened with respect. But bring their children to be baptized, they would not. The Spaniards had treated them very badly long ago, and they had been medi- tating upon their grievance for many generations. Father Vaillant had not baptized one infant there, but he meant to stop to-morrow and try again. Then back to his Bishop, provided he could get his horse up La Bajada Hill. He had bought his horse from a Yankee trader and had been woefully deceived. One weeks journey of from twenty to thirty miles a day had shown the beast up for a wind-broken wreck. Father Vaillants mind was full of material cares as he approached Manuel Lujons place beyond Bernalillo. The ran- cho was like a little town, with all its stables, corrals, and stake fences. The casa grande was long and low, with glass windows and bright blue doors, a portale running its full length, supported by blue posts. Under this portale the adobe wall was hung with bridles, saddles, great boots and spurs, guns and saddle blankets, strings of red peppers, fox skins, and the skins of two great rattlesnakes. 53 \ DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP When Father Vaillant rode in through the gate- way, children came running from every direction, some with no clothing but a little shirt, and women with no shawls over their black hair came running after the children. They all disappeared when Manuel Lujon walked out of the great house, hat in hand, smiling and hospitable. He was a man of thirty-five, settled in figure and somewhat full under the chin. He greeted the priest in the name of God and put out a hand to help him alight, but Father Vaillant sprang quickly to the ground. God be with you, Manuel, and with your house. But where are those who are to be married? The men are all in the field, Padre. There is no hurry. A little wine, a little bread, coffee, repose and then the ceremonies. A little wine, very willingly, and bread, too. But not until afterward. I meant to catch you all at din- ner, but I am two hours late because my horse is bad. Have someone bring in my saddle-bags, and I will put on my vestments. Send out to the fields for your men, Sefior Lujon. A man can stop work to be married. The swarthy host was dazed by this dispatch. But one moment, Padre. There are all the children to baptize; why not begin with them, if I cannot persuade you to wash the dust from your sainted brow and repose a little. 54 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS Take me to a place where I can wash and change my clothes, and I will be ready before you can get them here. No, I tell you, Lujon, the marriages first, the baptisms afterward; that order is but Christian. I will baptize the children tomorrow morning, and their parents will at least have been married over night. Father Joseph was conducted to his chamber, and the older boys were sent running off across the fields to fetch the men. Lujon and his two daughters began constructing an altar at one end of the sala. Two old women came to scrub the floor, and another brought chairs and stools. My God, but he is ugly, the Padre! whispered one of these to the",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,16,"others. He must be very holy. And did you see the great wart he has on his chin? My grandmother could take that away for him if she were alive, poor soul! Somebody ought to tell him about the holy mud at Chimayo. That mud might dry it up. But there is nobody left now who can take warts away. No, the times are not so good any more, the other agreed. And I doubt if all this marrying will make them any better. Of what use is it to marry people after they have lived together and had children? and the man is maybe thinking about another woman, like Pablo. I saw him coming out of the brush with that oldest girl of Trinidads, only Sunday night. 55 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP The reappearance of the priest upon the scene cut short further scandal. He knelt down before the improvised altar and began his private devotions. The women tiptoed away. Sefior Lujon himself went out toward the servants quarters to hurry the candi- dates for the marriage sacrament. The women were giggling and snatching up their best shawls. Some of the men had even washed their hands. The household crowded into the sala, and Father Vaillant married couples with great dispatch. To-morrow morning, the baptisms, he an- nounced. And the mothers see to it that the chil- dren are clean, and that there are sponsors for all. After he had resumed his _travelling-clothes, Father Joseph asked his host at what hour he dined, remarking that he had been fasting since an early breakfast. We eat when it is ready a little after sunset, usually. I have had a young lamb killed for your Reverence. Father Joseph kindled with interest. Ah, and how will it be cooked? Sefior Lujon shrugged. Cooked? Why, they put it in a pot with chili, and some onions, I suppose. Ah, that is the point. I have had too much stewed mutton. Will you permit me to go into the kitchen and cook my portion in my own way? Lujon waved his hand. My house is yours, Padre. 56 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS Into the kitchen I never go too many women. But there it is, and the woman in charge is named $ Rosa. When the Father entered the kitchen he found a crowd of women discussing the marriages. They quickly dispersed, leaving old Rosa by her fire-place, where hung a kettle from which issued the savour of cooking mutton fat, all too familiar to Father Joseph. He found a half sheep hanging outside the door, covered with a bloody sack, and asked Rosa to heat the oven for him, announcing that he meant to roast the hind leg. But Padre, I baked before the marriages. The oven is almost cold. It will take an hour to heat it, and it is only two hours till suppper. Very well. I can cook my roast in an hour. Cook a roast in an hour! cried the old woman. Mother of God, Padre, the blood will not be dried in it! Not if I can help it! said Father Joseph fiercely. Now hurry with the fire, my good woman. When the Padre carved his roast at the supper- table, the serving-girls stood behind his chair and looked with horror at the delicate stream of pink juice that followed the knife. Manuel Lujon took a slice for politeness, but he did not eat it. Father Vaillant had his gigot to himself. All the men and boys sat down at the long table 57 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP with the host, the women and children would eat later. Father Joseph and Lujon, at one end, had a bottle of white Bordeaux between them. It had been brought from Mexico City on mule-back, Lujon said. They were discussing the road back to Santa F, and when the missionary remarked that he would stop at Santo Domingo, the host asked him why he did not get a horse there. I am afraid you will hardly get back to Santa F on your own. The pueblo is famous for breeding good horses. You might make a trades No, said Father Vaillant. Those Indians are of a sullen disposition. If I were to have dealings with them, they would suspect my motives. If we are to save their souls, we must make it clear that we want no profit for ourselves, as I told Father Gallegos in Albuquerque. Manuel Lujon laughed and glanced down the table at his men, who were all showing their white teeth. You said that to the Padre at Albuquerque? You have courage. He is a rich man, Padre Gallegos. All the same, I respect him. I have played poker with him. He is a great gambler and",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,17,"takes his losses like a man. He stops at nothing, plays like an American. And I, retorted Father Joseph, I have not much respect for a priest who either plays cards or manages to get rich. Then you do not play? asked Lujon. I am 58 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS disappointed. I had hoped we could have a game after supper. The evenings are dull enough here. You do not even play dominoes? Ah, that is another matter! Father Joseph de- clared. A game of dominoes, there by the fire, with coffee, or some of that excellent grape brandy you allowed me to taste, that I would find refreshing. And tell me, Manuelito, where do you get that brandy? It is like a French liqueur. Tt is well seasoned. It was made at Bernalillo in my grandfathers time. They make it there still, but it is not so good now. The next morning, after coffee, while the children were being got ready for baptism, the host took Father Vaillant through his corrals and stables to show him his stock. He exhibited with peculiar pride two cream-coloured mules, stalled side by side. With his own hand he led them out of the stable, in order to display to advantage their handsome coats, not bluish white, as with white horses, but a rich, deep ivory, that in shadow changed to fawn-colour. Their tails were clipped at the end into the shape of bells. Their names, said Lujon, are Contento and. Angelica, and they are as good as their names. It seems that God has given them intelligence. When I talk to them, they look up at me like Christians; they are very companionable. They are always 59 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP ridden together and have a great affection for each other. Father Joseph took one by the halter and led it about. Ah, but they are rare creatures! I have never seen a mule or horse coloured like a young fawn be- fore. To his hosts astonishment, the wiry little priest sprang upon Contentos back with the agility of a grasshopper. The mule, too, was astonished. He shook himself violently, bolted toward the gate of the barnyard, and at the gate stopped suddenly. Since this did not throw his rider, he seemed satis- fied, trotted back, and stood placidly beside Angelica. But you are a caballero, Father Vaillant! Lujon exclaimed. I doubt if Father Gallegos would have kept his seat though he is something of a hunter. The saddle is to be my home in your country, Lujon. What an easy gait this mule has, and what a narrow back! I notice that especially. For a man with short legs, like me, it is a punishment to ride eight hours a day on a wide horse. And this I must do day after day. From here I go to Santa F, and, after a day in conference with the Bishop, I start for Mora. _ For Mora? exclaimed Lujon. Yes, that is far, and the roads are very bad. On your mare you will never do it. She will drop dead under you. While he talked, the Father remained upon the mules back, stroking him with his hand. Well, I have no other. God grant that she does 60 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS not drop somewhere far from food and water. I can carry very little with me except my vestments and : the sacred vessels. The Mexican had been growing more and more thoughtful, as if he were considering something pro- found and not altogether cheerful. Suddenly his brow cleared, and he turned to the priest with a radiant smile, quite boyish in its simplicity. Father Vail- lant, he burst out in a slightly oratorical manner, vou have made my house right with Heaven, and you charge me very little. I will do something very nice for you; I will give you Contento for a present, and I hope to be particularly remembered in your prayers. Springing to the ground, Father Vaillant threw his arms about his host. Manuelito! he cried, for this darling mule I think I could almost pray you into Heaven! The Mexican laughed, too, and warmly returned the embrace. Arm-in-arm they went in to begin the baptisms. The next morning, when Lujon went to call Father Vaillant for breakfast, he found him in the barnyard, leading the two mules about and smoothing their - fawn-coloured flanks, but his face was not the cheer- ful countenance of yesterday. Manuel, he said at once, T cannot accept 61 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP your present. I have thought upon it over night, and I see that I cannot. The Bishop works as hard as I do, and his horse is little better than mine. You know he lost everything on his way",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no

I could not go about on a mule like this when my Bishop rides a common hack. It would be inappro- priate. I must ride away on my old mare. troubled Ves, Padre? Manuel looked and somewhat aggrieved. Why should the Padre spoil everything? It had all been very pleasant yesterday, and he had felt like a prince of generosity. I doubt if she will make La Bajada Hill, he said slowly, shaking his head. Look my horses over and take the one that suits you. They are all better than yours. No, no, said Father Vaillant decidedly. Having seen these mules, I want nothing else. They are the colour of pearls, really! I will raise the price of mar- riages until I can buy this pair from you. A mission- ary must depend upon his mount for companionship in his lonely life. I want a mule that can look at me like a Christian, as you said of these. Sefior Lujon sighed and looked about his barnyard as if he were trying to find some escape from this situation. Father Joseph turned to him with vehemence. 62 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS Tf [ were a rich ranchero, like you, Manuel, I would do a splendid thing; I would furnish the two mounts that are to carry the word of God about this heathen country, and then I would say to myself: There go my Bishop and my Vicario, on my beautiful cream- coloured mules. So be it, Padre, said Lujon with a mournful smile. But I ought to get a good many prayers. On my whole estate there is nothing I prize like those two. True, they might pine if they were parted for long. They have never been separated, and they have a great affection for each other. Mules, as you know, have strong affections. It is hard for me to give them up. You will be all the happier for that, Manuelito, Father Joseph cried heartily. Every time you think of these mules, you will feel pride in your good deed. Soon after breakfast Father Vaillant departed, riding Contento, with Angelica trotting submissively behind, and from his gate Sefor Lujon watched them disconsolately until they disappeared. He felt he had been worried out of his mules, and yet he bore no resentment. He did not doubt Father Josephs devotedness, nor his singleness of purpose. After all, a Bishop was a Bishop, and a Vicar was a Vicar, and it was not to their discredit that they worked like a pair of common parish priests. He believed he would 63 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP be proud of the fact that they rode Contento and Angelica. Father Vaillant had forced his hand, but he was rather glad of it. 2 THE LONELY ROAD TO MORA Tr Bishop and his Vicar were riding through the rain in the Truchas mountains. The heavy, lead- coloured drops were driven slantingly through the air by an icy wind from the peak. These raindrops, Father Latour kept thinking, were the shape of tad- poles, and they broke against his nose and cheeks, exploding with a splash, as if they were hollow and full of air. The priests were riding across high moun- tain meadows, which in a few weeks would be green, though just now they were slate-coloured. On every side lay ridges covered with blue-green fir trees; above them rose the horny backbones of mountains. The sky was very low; purplish lead-coloured clouds let down curtains of mist into the valleys between the pine ridges. There was not a glimmer of white light in the dark vapours working overhead rather, they took on the cold green of the evergreens. Even 64 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS the white mules, their coats wet and matted into tufts, had turned a slaty hue, and the faces of the two priests were purple and spotted in that singular light. Father Latour rode first, sitting straight upon his mule, with his chin lowered just enough to keep the drive of rain out of his eyes. Father Vaillant followed, unable to see much, in weather like this his glasses were of no use, and he had taken them off. He crouched down in the saddle, his shoulders well over Contentos neck. Father Josephs sister, Philomne, who was Mother Superior of a convent in her native town in the Puy-de-Dm, often tried to picture her brother and Bishop Latour on these long missionary journeys of which he wrote her; she imagined the scene and saw the two priests moving through it in their cassocks, bare-headed, like the pictures of St. Francis Xavier with which she was familiar. The reality was less",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,19,"picturesque, but for all that, no one could have mistaken these two men for hunters or traders. They wore clerical collars about their necks instead of neckerchiefs, and on the breast of his buckskin jacket the Bishops silver cross hung by a silver chain. They were on their way to Mora, the third day out, and they did not know just how far they had still to go. Since morning they had not met a traveller or seen a human habitation. They believed they were on 6s DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP the right trail, for they had seen no other. The first night of their journey they had spent at Santa Cruz, lying in the warm, wide valley of the Rio Grande, where the fields and gardens were already softly coloured with early spring. But since they had left the Espafiola country behind them, they had con- tended first with wind and sand-storms, and now with cold. The Bishop was going to Mora to assist the Padre there in disposing of a crowd of refugees who filled his house. A new settlement in the Conejos valley had lately been raided by Indians; many of the inhabitants were killed, and the survivors, who were originally from Mora, had managed to get back there, utterly destitute. Before the travellers had crossed the mountain meadows, the rain turned to sleet. Their wet buck- skins quickly froze, and the rattle of icy flakes struck them and bounded off. The prospect of a night in the open was not cheering. It was too wet to kindle a fire, their blankets would become soaked on the ground. As they were descending the mountain on the Mora side, the gray daylight seemed already beginning to fail, though it was only four oclock. Father Latour turned in his saddle and spoke over his shoulder. The mules are certainly very tired, Joseph. They ought to be fed. Push on, said Father Vaillant. We will come to Fepce? 66 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS shelter of some kind before night sets in. The Vicar had been praying steadfastly while they crossed the meadows, and he felt confident that St. Joseph would not turn a deaf ear. Before the hour was done they did indeed come upon a wretched adobe house, so poor and mean that they might not have seen it had it not lain close beside the trail, on the edge of a steep ravine. The stable looked more habitable than the house, and the priests thought perhaps they could spend the night in it. As they rode up to the door, a man came out, bare-headed, and they saw to their surprise that he was not a Mexican, but an American, of a very un- prepossessing type. He spoke to them in some drawling dialect they could scarcely understand and asked if they wanted to stay the night. During the few words they exchanged with him Father Latour felt a growing reluctance to remain even for a few hours under the roof of this ugly, evil-looking fellow. He was tall, gaunt and ill-formed, with a snake-like neck, terminating in a small, bony head. Under his close-clipped hair this repellent head showed a number of thick ridges, as if the skull joinings were overgrown by layers of superfluous bone. With its small, rudimentary ears, this head had a positively malignant look. The man seemed not more than half human, but he was the only householder on the lonely road to Mora. 67 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP The priests dismounted and asked him whether he could put their mules under shelter and give them grain feed. As soon as I git my coat on I will. You kin come vse They followed him into a room where a pifion fire blazed in the corner, and went toward it to warm their stiffened hands. Their host made an angry, snarling sound in the direction of the partition, and a, woman came out of the next room. She was a Mexi- can. Father Latour and Father Vaillant addressed her courteously in Spanish, greeting her in the name of the Holy Mother, as was customary. She did not open her lips, but stared at them blankly for a mo- ment, then dropped her eyes and cowered as if she were terribly frightened. The priests looked at each other; it struck them both that this man had been abusing her in some way. Suddenly he turned on her. Clear off them cheers fur the strangers. They won't eat ye, if they air priests. She began distractedly snatching rags and wet socks and dirty clothes from the chairs. Her hands were shaking so that she dropped things. She was not old, she might have been very young, but she was probably half-witted. There was nothing in",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,20,"her face but blankness and fear. Her husband put on his coat and boots, went to 63 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS the door, and stopped with his hand on the latch, throwing over his shoulder a crafty, hateful glance at the bewildered woman. Here, you! Come right along, I'll need ye! She took her black shawl from a peg and followed him. Just at the door she turned and caught the eyes of the visitors, who were looking after her in com- passion and perplexity. Instantly that stupid face became intense, prophetic, full of awful meaning. With her finger she pointed them away, away! two quick thrusts into the air. Then, with a look of horror beyond anything language could convey, she threw back her head and drew the edge of her palm quickly across her distended throat and vanished. The doorway was empty; the two priests stood staring at it, speechless. That flash of electric passion had been so swift, the warning it communi- cated so vivid and definite, that they were struck dumb. Father Joseph was the first to find his tongue. There is no doubt of her meaning. Your pistol is loaded, Jean? Ves, but I neglected to keep it dry. No matter. They hurried out of the house. It was still light enough to see the stable through the grey drive of rain, and they went toward it. Sefior American, the Bishop called, will you be good enough to bring out our mules? 69. DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP The man came out of the stable. What do you want? Our mules. We have changed our mind. We will push on to Mora. And here is a dollar for your trouble. The man took a threatening attitude. As he looked from one to the other his head played from side to side exactly like a snakes. Whats the matter? My house aint good enough for ye? No explanation is necessary. Go into the barn and get the mules, Father Joseph. Vou dare go into my stable, you priest The Bishop drew his pistol. No profanity, Sefior. We want nothing from you but to get away from your uncivil tongue. Stand where you are. {?? The man was unarmed. Father Joseph came out with the mules, which had not been unsaddled. The poor things were each munching a mouthful, but they needed no urging to be gone; they did not like this place. The moment they felt their riders on their backs they trotted quickly along the road, which dropped immediately into the arroyo. While they were descending, Father Joseph remarked that the man would certainly have a gun in the house, and that he had no wish to be shot in the back. Nor I. But it is growing too dark for that, unless he should follow us on horseback, said the Bishop. Were there horses in the stable? ye) MISSIONARY JOURNEYS Only a burro. Father Vaillant was relying upon the protection of St. Joseph, whose office he had fervently said that morning. The warning given them by that poor woman, with such scant opportunity, seemed evidence that some protecting power was mindful of them. By the time they had ascended the far side of the arroyo, night had closed down and the rain was pour- ing harder than ever. T am by no means sure that we can keep in the road, said the Bishop. But at least I am sure we are not being followed. We must trust to these in- telligent beasts. Poor woman! He will suspect her and abuse her, I am afraid. He kept seeing her in the darkness as he rode on, her face in the fire-light, and her terrible pantomime. They reached the town of Mora a little after mid- night. The Padres house was full of refugees, and two of them were put out of a bed in order that the Bishop and his Vicar could get into it. In the morning a boy came from the stable and reported that he had found a crazy woman lying in the straw, and that she begged to see the two Padres who owned the white mules. She was brought in, her clothing cut to rags, her legs and face and even her hair so plastered with mud that the priests could scarcely recognize the woman who had saved their lives the night before. GE DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP She said she had never gone back to the house at all. When the two priests rode away her husband had run to the house to get his gun, and she had plunged down a wash-out behind the stable into the arroyo, and had been on the way to Mora all night. She had supposed he would overtake her and kill her,",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,21,"but he had not. She reached the settlement before day-break, and crept into the stable to warm herself among the animals and wait until the household was awake. Kneeling before the Bishop she began to relate such horrible things that he stopped her and turned to the native priest. This is a case for the civil authorities. Is there a magistrate here? There was no magistrate, but there was a retired fur trapper who acted as notary and could take evidence. He was sent for, and in the interval Father Latour instructed the refugee women from Conejos to bathe this poor creature and put decent clothes on her, and to care for the cuts and scratches on her legs. An hour later the woman, whose name was Magda- lena, calmed by food and kindness, was ready to tell her story. The notary had brought along his friend, St. Vrain, a Canadian trapper who understood Span- ish better than he. The woman was known to St. Vrain, moreover, who confirmed her statement that she was born Magdalena Valdez, at Los Ranchos de Taos, and that she was twenty-four years old. Her 72 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS husband, Buck Scales, had drifted into Taos with a party of hunters from somewhere in Wyoming. All white men knew him for a dog and a degenerate but to Mexican girls, marriage with an American meant coming up in the world. She had married him six years ago, and had been living with him ever since in that wretched house on the Mora trail. During that time he had robbed and murdered four travellers who had stopped there for the night. They were all strangers, not known in the country. She had forgot their names, but one was a German boy who spoke very little Spanish and little English; a nice boy with blue eyes, and she had grieved for him more than for the others. They were all buried in the sandy soil behind the stable. She was always afraid their bodies might wash out in a storm. Their horses Buck had ridden off by night and sold to Indians somewhere in the north. Magdalena had borne three children since her marriage, and her husband had killed each of them a few days after birth, by ways so horrible that she could not relate it. After he killed the first baby, she ran away from him, back to her parents at Ranchos. He came after her and made her go home with him by threatening harm to the old people. She was afraid to go any- where for help, but twice before she had managed to warn travellers away, when her husband happened to be out of the house. This time she had found 13 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP courage because, when she looked into the faces of these two Padres, she knew they were good men, and she thought if she ran after them they could save her. She could not bear any more killing. She asked nothing better than to die herself, if only she could hide near a church and a priest for a while, to make her soul right with God. St. Vrain and his friend got together a search- party at once. They rode out to Scaless place and found the remains of four men buried under the corral behind the stable, as the woman had said. Scales himself they captured on the road from Taos, where he had gone to look for his wife. They brought him back to Mora, but St. Vrain rode on to Taos to fetch a magistrate. There was no calabozo in Mora, so Scales was put into an empty stable, under guard. This stable was soon surrounded by a crowd of people, who loitered to hear the blood-curdling threats the prisoner shouted against his wife. Magdalena was kept in the Padres house, where she lay on a mat in the corner, begging Father Latour to take her back to Santa F, so that her husband could not get at her. Though Scales was bound, the Bishop felt alarmed for her safety. He and the American notary, who had a pistol of the new revolver model, sat in the sala and kept watch over her all night. In the morning the magistrate and his party ar- 74 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS rived from Taos. The notary told him the facts of the case in the plaza, where everyone could hear. The Bishop inquired whether there was any place for Magdalena in Taos, as she could not stay on here in such a state of terror. A man dressed in buckskin hunting-clothes stepped out of the crowd and asked to see Magdalena. Father Latour conducted him into the room where she lay on her mat. The stranger went",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,22,"up to her, removing his hat. He bent down and put his hand on her shoulder. Though he was clearly an American, he spoke Spanish in the native manner. Magdalena, dont you remember me? She looked up at him as out of a dark well; some- thing became alive in her deep, haunted eyes. She caught with both hands at his fringed buckskin knees. Christobal! she wailed. Oh, Christobal! Tll take you home with me, Magdalena, and you can stay with my wife. You wouldnt be afraid in my house, would you? No, no, Christobal, I would not be afraid with you. I am not a wicked woman. He smoothed her hair. Youre a good girl, Magda- lena always were. It will be all right. Just leave things to me. Then he turned to the Bishop. Sefior Vicario, she can come to me. I live near Taos. My wife is a native woman, and shell be good to her. That varmint a DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP wont come about my place, even if he breaks jail. He knows me. My name is Carson. Father Latour had looked forward to meeting the scout. He had supposed him to be a very large man, of powerful body and commanding presence. This Carson was not so tall as the Bishop himself, was very slight in frame, modest in manner, and he spoke English with a soft Southern drawl. His face was both thoughtful and alert; anxiety had drawn a permanent ridge between his blue eyes. Under his blond moustache his mouth had a singular refine- ment. The lips were full and delicately modelled. There was something curiously unconscious about his mouth, reflective, a little melancholy, and something that suggested a capacity for tenderness. The Bishop felt a quick glow of pleasure in looking at the man. As he stood there in his buckskin clothes one felt in him standards, loyalties, a code which is not easily put into words but which is instantly felt when two men who live by it come together by chance. He took the scouts hand. I have long wanted to meet Kit Carson, he said, even before I came to New Mexico. I have been hoping you would pay me a visit at Santa F. The other smiled. Im right shy, sir, and Im always afraid of being disappointed. But I guess it will be all right from now on. This was the beginning of a long friendship. 76 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS On their ride back to Carsons ranch, Magdalena was put in Father Vaillants care, and the Bishop and the scout rode together. Carson said he had become a Catholic merely as a matter of form, as Americans usually did when they married a Mexican girl. His wife was a good woman and very devout; but re- ligion had seemed to him pretty much a womans affair until his last trip to California. He had been sick out there, and the Fathers at one of the missions took care of him. I began to see things different, and thought I might some day be a Catholic in earnest. I was brought up to think priests were rascals, and that the nuns were bad women, all the stuff they talk back in Missouri. A good many of the native priests here bear out that story. Our Padre Martinez at Taos is an old scapegrace, if ever there was one; hes got children and grandchildren in almost every settlement around here. And Padre Lucero at Arroyo Hondo is a miser, takes everything a poor mans got to give him a Christian burial. The Bishop discussed the needs of his people at length with Carson. He felt great confidence in his judgment. The two men were about the same age, both a little over forty, and both had been sobered and sharpened by wide experience. Carson had been guide in world-renowned explorations, but he was still almost as poor as in the days when he was a beaver trapper. He lived in a little adobe house 77 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP with his Mexican wife. The great country of desert and mountain ranges between Santa F and the Pacific coast was not yet mapped or charted; the most reliable map of it was in Kit Carsons brain. This Missourian, whose eye was so quick to read a landscape or a human face, could not read a printed page. He could at that time barely write his own name. Yet one felt in him a quick and discriminating intelligence. That he was illiterate was an accident; he had got ahead of books, gone where the printing- press could not follow him.

death comes for the archbishop,23,"mule-driver for wagon trains, often in the service of brutal and desperate char- acters he had preserved a clean sense of honour and a compassionate heart. In talking to the Bishop of poor Magdalena he said sadly: I used to see her in Taos when she was such a pretty girl. Aint it a pity? The degenerate murderer, Buck Scales, was hanged after a short trial. Early in April the Bishop left Santa F on horseback and rode to St. Louis, on his way to attend the Provincial Council at Baltimore. When he returned in September, he brought back with him five courageous nuns, Sisters of Loretto, to found a school for girls in letterless Santa F. He sent at once for Magdalena and took her into the 78 MISSIONARY JOURNEYS service of the Sisters. She became housekeeper and manager of the Sisters kitchen. She was devoted to the nuns, and so happy in the service of the Church that when the Bishop visited the school he used to enter by the kitchen-garden in order to see her serene and handsome face. For she became beautiful, as Carson said she had been as a girl. After the blight of her horrible youth was over, she seemed to bloom again in the household of God. 79 BOOK THREE THE MASS AT ACOMA I THE WOODEN PARROT URING the first year after his arrival in Santa F, the Bishop was actually in his diocese only about four months. Six months of that first year were consumed in attending the Plenary Council at Baltimore, to which he had been summoned. He went on horseback over the Santa F trail to St. Louis, nearly a thousand miles, then by steam- boat to Pittsburgh, across the mountains to Cumber- land, and on to Washington by the new railroad. The return journey was even slower, as he had with him the five nuns who came to found the school of Our Lady of Light. He reached Santa F late in September. So far, Bishop Latour had been mainly employed on business that took him far away from his Vicarate. His great diocese was still an unimaginable mystery 80 THE MASS AT ACOMA to him. He was eager to be abroad in it, to know his people; to escape for a little from the cares of building and founding, and to go westward among the old isolated Indian missions; Santo Domingo, breeder of horses; Isleta, whitened with gypsum; Laguna, of wide pastures; and finally, cloud-set Acoma. In the golden October weather the Bishop, with his blankets and coffee-pot, attended by Jacinto, a young Indian from the Pecos pueblo, whom he employed as guide, set off to visit the Indian missions in the west. He spent a night and a day at Albuquerque, with the genial and popular Padre Gallegos. After Santa F, Albuquerque was the most important parish in the diocese; the priest belonged to an in- fluential Mexican family, and he and the rancheros had run their church to suit themselves, making a very gay affair of it. Though Padre Gallegos was ten years older than the Bishop, he would still dance the fandango five nights running, as if he could never have enough of it. He had many friends in the American colony, with whom he played poker and went hunting, when he was not dancing with the Mexicans. His cellar was well stocked with wines from E] Paso del Norte, whisky from Taos, and grape brandy from Bernalillo. He was genuinely hospitable, and the gambler down on his luck, the soldier sobering up, were always welcome at his table. The Padre was adored by a rich Mexican widow, who was hostess 81 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP at his supper parties, engaged his servants for him, made lace for the altar and napery for his table. Every Sunday her carriage, the only closed one in Albuquerque, waited in the plaza after Mass, and when the priest had put off his vestments, he came out and was driven away to the ladys hacienda for dinner. The Bishop and Father Vaillant had thoroughly examined the case of Father Gallegos, and meant to end this scandalous state of things well before Christ- mas. But on this visit Father Latour exhibited neither astonishment nor displeasure at anything, and Padre Gallegos was cordial and most ceremo- niously polite. When the Bishop permitted himself to express some surprise that there was not a confirma- tion class awaiting him, the Padre explained smoothly that it was his custom to confirm infants at their baptism. Tt is all the same in a Christian community like ours. We know they will receive religious instruction as they grow up, so we make good Catholics of them in the beginning. Why not? The Padre was",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,24,"uneasy lest the Bishop should require his attendance on this trip out among the missions. He had no liking for scanty food and a bed on the rocks. So, though he had been dancing only a few nights before, he received his Superior with one foot bandaged up in an Indian moccasin, and com- 82 THE MASS AT ACOMA plained of a severe attack of gout. Asked when he had last celebrated Mass at Acoma, he made no direct reply. It used to be his custom, he said, to go there in Passion Week, but the Acoma Indians were unre- claimed heathen at heart, and had no wish to be bothered with the Mass. The last time he went out there, he was unable to get into the church at all. The Indians pretended they had not the key; that the Governor had it, and that he had gone on Indian business up into the Cebolleta mountains. The Bishop did not wish Padre Gallegoss company upon his journey, was very glad not to have the embarrassment of refusing it, and he rode away from Albuquerque after polite farewells. Yet, he reflected, there was something very engaging about Gallegos as a man. As a priest, he was impossible; he was too self-satisfied and popular ever to change his ways, and he certainly could not change his face. He did not look quite like a professional gambler, but something smooth and twinkling in his countenance suggested an underhanded mode of life. There was but one course: to suspend the man from the exercise of all priestly functions, and bid the smaller native priests take warning. Father Vaillant had told the Bishop that he must by all means stop a night at Isleta, as he would like the priest there Padre Jesus de Baca, an old white-haired man, almost blind, who had been at 83 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Isleta many years and had won the confidence and affection of his Indians. When he approached this pueblo of Isleta, gleam- ing white across a low plain of grey sand, Father Latours spirits rose. It was beautiful, that warm, rich whiteness of the church and the clustered town, shaded by a few bright acacia trees, with their in- tense blue-green like the colour of old paper win- dow-blinds. That tree always awakened pleasant memories, recalling a garden in the south of France where he used to visit young cousins. As he rode up to the church, the old priest came out to meet him, and after his salutation stood looking at Father Latour, shading his failing eyes with his hand. And can this be my Bishop? So young a man? he exclaimed. They went into the priests house by way of a garden, walled in behind the church. This enclosure was full of domesticated cactus plants, of many varieties and great size (it seemed the Padre loved them), and among these hung wicker cages made of willow twigs, full of parrots. There were even par- rots hopping about the sanded paths, with one wing clipped to keep them at home. Father Jesus ex- plained that parrot feathers were much prized by his Indians as ornaments for their ceremonial robes, and he had long ago found he could please his parish- ioners by raising the birds. 84 THE MASS AT ACOMA The priests house was white within and without, like all the Isleta houses, and was almost as bare as an Indian dwelling. The old man was poor, and too soft-hearted to press the pueblo people for pesos. An Indian girl cooked his beans and cornmeal mush for him, he required little else. The girl was not very skilful, he said, but she was clean about her cooking. When the Bishop remarked that everything in this pueblo, even the streets, seemed clean, the Padre told him that near Isleta there was a hill of some white mineral, which the Indians ground up and used as whitewash. They had done this from time imme- morial, and the village had always been noted for its whiteness. A little talk with Father Jesus revealed that he was simple almost to childishness, and very superstitious. But there was a quality of golden goodness about him. His right eye was overgrown by a cataract, and he kept his head tilted as if he were trying to see around it. All his movements were to the left, as if he were reaching or walking about some obstacle in his path. After coming to the house by way of a garden full of parrots, Father Latour was amused to find that the sole ornament in the Padres poor, bare little sala was a wooden parrot, perched in a hoop and hung from one of the roof-logs. While Father Jesus was instructing",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,25,"his Indian girl in the kitchen, the Bishop took this carving down from its perch to 85 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP examine it. It was cut from a single stick of wood, exactly the size of a living bird, body and tail rigid and straight, the head a little turned. The wings and tail and neck feathers were just indicated by the tool, and thinly painted. He was surprised to feel how light it was; the surface had the whiteness and velvety smoothness of very old wood. Though scarcely carved at all, merely smoothed into shape, it was strangely lifelike; a wooden pattern of parrots, as it were. The Padre smiled when he found the Bishop with the bird in his hand. T see you have found my treasure! That, your Grace, is probably the oldest thing in the pueblo older than the pueblo itself. The parrot, Father Jesus said, had always been the bird of wonder and desire to the pueblo Indians. In ancient times its feathers were more valued than wampum and turquoises. Even before the Spaniards came, the pueblos of northern New Mexico used to send explorers along the dangerous and difficult trade routes down into tropical Mexico to bring back upon their bodies a cargo of parrot feathers. To purchase these the trader carried pouches full of turquoises from the Cerrillos hills near Santa F. When, very rarely, a trader succeeded in bringing back a live bird to his people, it was paid divine honours, and its death threw the whole village into 86 THE MASS AT ACOMA the deepest gloom. Even the bones were piously preserved. There was in Isleta a parrot skull of great antiquity. His wooden bird he had bought from an old man who was much indebted to him, and who was about to die without descendants. Father Jesus had had his eye upon the bird for years. The Indian told him that his ancestors, generations ago, had brought it with them from the mother pueblo. The priest fondly believed that it was a portrait, done from life, of one of those rare birds that in ancient times were carried up alive, all the long trail from the tropics. Father Jesus gave a good report of the Indians at Laguna and Acoma. He used to go to those pueblos to hold services when he was younger, and had al- ways found them friendly. At Acoma, he said, you can see something very holy. They have there a portrait of St. Joseph, sent to them by one of the Kings of Spain, long ago, and it has worked many miracles. If the season is dry, the Acoma people take the picture down to their farms at Acomita, and it never fails to produce rain. They have rain when none falls in all the country, and they have crops when the Laguna Indians have none. 87 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP 2 JACINTO Taxue leave of Isleta and its priest early in the morning, Father Latour and his guide rode all day through the dry desert plain west of Albuquerque. It was like a country of dry ashes; no juniper, no rabbit brush, nothing but thickets of withered, dead-looking cactus, and patches of wild pumpkin the only vegetation that had any vitality. It is a vine, remarkable for its tendency, not to spread and ramble, but to mass and mount. Its long, sharp, arrow-shaped leaves, frosted over with prickly silver, are thrust upward and crowded together; the whole rigid, up-thrust matted clump looks less like a plant than like a great colony of grey-green lizards, moving and suddenly arrested by fear. | As the morning wore on they had to make their way through a sand-storm which quite obscured the sun. Jacinto knew the country well, having crossed it often to go to the religious dances at Laguna, but he rode with his head low and a purple handkerchief tied over his mouth. Coming from a pueblo among woods and water, he had a poor opinion of this plain. At noon he alighted and collected enough grease- wood to boil the Bishops coffee. They knelt on either 88 THE MASS AT ACOMA side of the fire, the sand curling about them so that the bread became gritty as they ate it. The sun set red in an atmosphere murky with sand. The travellers made a dry camp and rolled themselves in their blankets. All night a cold wind blew over them. Father Latour was so stiff that he arose long before day-break. The dawn came at last, fair and clear, and they made an early start. ochre. About the middle of that afternoon Jacinto pointed out Laguna in the distance, lying, apparently, in the midst of bright yellow waves of high sand dunes",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,26,"yellow as As they approached, Father Latour found these were petrified sand dunes; long waves of soft, gritty yellow rock, shining and bare except for a few lines of dark juniper that grew out of the weather cracks, little trees, and very, very old. At the foot of this sweep of rock waves was the blue lake, a stone basin full of water, from which the pueblo took its name. The kindly Padre at Isleta had sent his cooks brother off on foot to warn the Laguna people that the new High Priest was coming, and that he was a good man and did not want money. They were prepared, accordingly; the church was clean and the doors were open; a small white church, painted above and about the altar with gods of wind and rain and thunder, sun and moon, linked together in a geometrical design of crimson and blue and dark green, so that 89 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP the end of the church seemed to be hung with tapes- try. It recalled to Father Latour the interior of a Persian chieftains tent he had seen in a textile ex- hibit at Lyons. Whether this decoration had been done by Spanish missionaries or by Indian converts, he was unable to find out. The Governor told him that his people would come to Mass in the morning, and that there were a number of children to be baptized. He offered the Bishop the sacristy for the night, but there was a damp, earthy smell about that chamber, and Father Latour had already made up his mind that he would like to sleep on the rock dunes, under the junipers. Jacinto got firewood and good water from the Lagunas, and they made their camp in a pleasant spot on the rocks north of the village. As the sun dropped low, the light brought the white church and the yellow adobe houses up into relief from the flat ledges, Behind their camp, not far away, lay a group of great mesas. The Bishop asked Jacinto if he knew the name of the one nearest them. No, I not know any name, he shook his head. T know Indian name, he added, as if, for once, he were thinking aloud. And what is the Indian name? The Laguna Indians call Snow-Bird mountain. He spoke somewhat unwillingly. , 9 THE MASS AT ACOMA That is very nice, said the Bishop musingly. Ves, that is a pretty name. Oh, Indians have nice names too! Jacinto replied quickly, with a curl of the lip. Then, as if he felt he had taken out on the Bishop a reproach not deserved, he said in a moment: The Laguna people think it very funny for a big priest to be a young man. The Governor say, how can I call him Padre when he is younger than my sons? There was a note of pride in Jacintos voice very flattering to the Bishop. He had noticed how kind the Indian voice could be when it was kind at all; a slight inflection made one feel that one had received a great compliment. T am not very young in heart, Jacinto. How old are you, my boy? Twenty-six. Have you a son? One. Baby. Not very long born. Jacinto usually dropped the article in speaking Spanish, just as he did in speaking English, though the Bishop had noticed that when he did give a noun its article, he used the right one. The customary omission, therefore, seemed to be a matter of taste, not ignorance. In the Indian conception of language, such attachments were superfluous and unpleasing, per- haps. They relapsed into the silence which was their usual gli DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP form of intercourse. The Bishop sat drinking his coffee slowly out of the tin cup, keeping the pot near the embers. The sun had set now, the yellow rocks were turning grey, down in the pueblo the light of the cook fires made red patches of the glassless windows, and the smell of pinon smoke came softly through the still air. The whole western sky was the colour of golden ashes, with here and there a flush of red on the lip of a little cloud. High above the horizon the evening-star flickered like a lamp just lit, and close beside it was another star of constant light, much smaller. Jacinto threw away the end of his cornhusk ciga- rette and again spoke without being addressed. The ev-en-ing-star, he said in English, slowly and somewhat sententiously, then relapsed into Spanish. You see the little star beside, Padre? Indians call him the guide. The two companions sat, each thinking his own thoughts as night closed in about them; a blue night set with stars,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,27,"the bulk of the solitary mesas cutting into the firmament. The Bishop seldom questioned Jacinto about his thoughts or beliefs. He didnt think it polite, and he believed it to be useless. There was no way in which he could transfer his own memories of European civilization into the Indian mind, and he was quite willing to believe that be- hind Jacinto there was a long tradition, a story of g2 THE MASS AT ACOMA experience, which no language could translate to him. A chill came with the darkness. Father Latour put on his old fur-lined cloak, and Jacinto, loosening the blanket tied about his loins, drew it up over his head and shoulders. Many stars, he said presently. What you think about the stars, Padre? The wise men tell us they are worlds, like ours, Jacinto. The end of the Indians cigarette grew bright and then dull again before he spoke. I think not, he said in the tone of one who has considered a propo- sition fairly and rejected it. I think they are leaders great spirits. Perhaps they are, said the Bishop with a sigh. Whatever they are, they are great. Let us say Our Father, and go to sleep, my boy. Kneeling on either side of the embers they re- peated the prayer together and then rolled up in their blankets. The Bishop went to sleep thinking with satisfaction that he was beginning to have some sort of human companionship with his Indian boy. One called the young Indians boys, perhaps because there was something youthful and elastic in their bodies. Certainly about their behaviour there was nothing boyish in the American sense, nor even in the European sense. Jacinto was never, by any chance, naif; he was never taken by surprise. One 93 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP felt that his training, whatever it had been, had prepared him to meet any situation which might confront him. He was as much at home in the Bishops study as in his own pueblo and he was never too much at home anywhere. Father Latour felt he had gone a good way toward gaining his guides friend- ship, though he did not know how. The truth was, Jacinto liked the Bishops way of meeting people; thought he had the right tone with Padre Gallegos, the right tone with Padre Jesus, and that he had good manners with the Indians. In his experience, white people, when they addressed Indians, always put on a false face. There were many kinds of false faces; Father Vaillants, for example, was kindly but too vehement. The Bishop put on none at all. He stood straight and turned to the Governor of Laguna, and his face underwent no change. Jacinto thought this remarkable. 94 THE MASS AT ACOMA 3 THE ROCE Arter early Mass the next morning Father Latour and his guide rode off across the low plain that lies between Laguna and Acoma. In all his travels the Bishop had seen no country like this. From the flat red sea of sand rose great rock mesas, generally Gothic in outline, resembling vast cathedrals. They were not crowded together in disorder, but placed in wide spaces, long vistas between. This plain might once have been an enormous city, all the smaller quarters destroyed by time, only the public buildings left, piles of architecture that were like mountains. The sandy soil of the plain had a light sprinkling of junipers, and was splotched with masses of blooming rabbit brush, that olive-coloured plant that grows in high waves like a tossing sea, at this season covered with a thatch of bloom, yellow as gorse, or orange like marigolds. This mesa plain had an appearance of great an- tiquity, and of incompleteness; as if, with all the materials for world-making assembled, the Creator had desisted, gone away and left everything on the point of being brought together, on the eve of being arranged into mountain, plain, plateau. 95 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP The country was still waiting to be made into a landscape. Ever afterward the Bishop remembered his first ride to Acoma as his introduction to the mesa coun- try. One thing which struck him at once was that every mesa was duplicated by a cloud mesa, like a reflection, which lay motionless above it or moved slowly up from behind it. These cloud formations seemed to be always there, however hot and blue the sky. Sometimes they were flat terraces, ledges of vapour; sometimes they were dome-shaped, or fantastic, like the tops of silvery pagodas, rising one above another, as if an oriental city lay directly behind the rock. The great tables of granite set down in an empty plain were inconceivable without their attendant clouds, which were a part of them, as",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,28,"the smoke is part of the censer, or the foam of the wave. Coming along the Santa F trail, in the vast plains of Kansas, Father Latour had found the sky more a desert than the land; a hard, empty blue, very monot- onous to the eyes of a Frenchman. But west of the Pecos all that changed; here there was always ac- tivity overhead, clouds forming and moving all day long. Whether they were dark and full of violence, or soft and white with luxurious idleness, they powerfully affected the world beneath them. The desert, the mountains and mesas, were continually re-formed and re-coloured by the cloud shadows. 96 THE MASS AT ACOMA The whole country seemed fluid to the eye under this constant change of accent, this ever-varying distribution of light. : Jacinto interrupted these reflections by an exclama- tion. Acoma! He stopped his mule. The Bishop, following with his eye the straight, pointing Indian hand, saw, far away, two great mesas. They were almost square in shape, and at this dis- tance seemed close together, though they were really some miles apart. The far one his guide still pointed. The Bishops eyes were not so sharp as Jacintos, but now, looking down upon the top of the farther mesa from the high land on which they halted, he saw a flat white outline on the grey surface a white square made up of squares. That, his guide said, was the pueblo of Acoma. Riding on, they presently drew rein under the Enchanted Mesa, and Jacinto told him that on this, too, there had once been a village, but the stairway which had been the only access to it was broken off by a great storm many centuries ago, and its people had perished up there from hunger. But how, the Bishop asked him, did men first think of living on the top of naked rocks like these, hundreds of feet in the air, without soil or water? Jacinto shrugged. A man can do whole lot when 97 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP they hunt him day and night like an animal. Navajos on the north, Apaches on the south; the Acoma run up a rock to be safe. All this plain, the Bishop gathered, had once been the scene of a periodic man-hunt; these Indians, born in fear and dying by violence for generations, had at last taken this leap away from the earth, and on that rock had found the hope of all suffering and tormented creatures safety. They came down to the plain to hunt and to grow their crops, but there was always a place to go back to. If a band of Navajos were on the Acomas trail, there was still one hope; if he could reach his rock Sanctuary! On the wind- ing stone stairway up the cliff, a handful of men could keep off a multitude. The rock of Acoma had never been taken by a foe but once, by Spaniards in armour. It was very different from a mountain fastness; more lonely, more stark and grim, more appealing to the imagination. The rock, when one came to think of it, was the utmost expression of human need; even mere feeling yearned for it; it was the highest comparison of loyalty in love and friendship. Christ Himself had used that comparison for the disciple to whom He gave the keys of His Church. And the Hebrews of the Old Testament, always being carried captive into foreign lands, their rock was an idea of God, the only thing their conquerors could not take from them. 98 THE MASS AT ACOMA Already the Bishop had observed in Indian life a strange literalness, often shocking and disconcerting. The Acomas, who must Share the universal human yearning for something permanent, enduring, without shadow of change, they had their idea in substance. They actually lived upon their Rock; were born upon it and died upon it. There was an element of exaggera- tion in anything so simple! As they drew near the Acoma mesa, dark clouds began boiling up from behind it, like ink spots spreading in a brilliant sky. Rain come, remarked Jacinto. That is good. They will be well disposed. He left the mules in a stake corral at the foot of the mesa, took up the blan- kets, and hurried Father Latour into the narrow crack in the rock where the craggy edges formed a kind of natural stairway up the cliff. Wherever the footing was treacherous, it was helped out by little hand- holds, ground into the stone like smooth mittens. The mesa was absolutely naked of vegetation, but at its foot a rank plant grew conspicuously out of the sand; a plant with big white blossoms like Easter lilies. By its",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,29,"dark blue-green leaves, large and coarse- toothed, Father Latour recognized a species of the noxious datura. The size and luxuriance of these nightshades astonished him. They looked like great artificial plants, made of shining silk. While they were ascending the rock, deafening 99 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP thunder broke over their heads, and the rain began to fall as if it were spilled from a cloud-burst. Drawing into a deep twist of the stairway, under an over- hanging ledge, they watched the water shaken in heavy curtains in the air before them. In a moment the seam in which they stood was like the channel of a brook. Looking out over the great plain spot- ted with mesas and glittering with rain sheets, the Bishop saw the distant mountains bright with sun- light. Again he thought that the first Creation morning might have looked like this, when the dry land was first drawn up out of the deep, and all was confusion. The storm was over in half an hour. By the time the Bishop and his guide reached the last turn in the trail, and rose through the crack, stepping out on the flat top of the rock, the noontide sun was blazing down upon Acoma with almost insupportable bright- ness. The bare stone floor of the town and its deep- worn paths were washed white and clean, and those depressions in the surface which the Acomas call their cisterns, were full of fresh rain water. Already the women were bringing out their clothes, to begin washing. The drinking water was carried up the stairway in earthen jars on the heads of the women, from a secret spring below; but for all other pur- poses the people depended on the rainfall held in these cisterns. IKere) THE MASS AT ACOMA The top of the mesa was about ten acres in extent, the Bishop judged, and there was not a tree or a blade of green upon it; not a handful of soil, except the churchyard, held in by an adobe wall, where the earth for burial had been carried up in baskets from the plain below. The white dwellings, two and three storeyed, were not scattered, but huddled together in a close cluster, with no protecting slope of ground or shoulder of rock, lying flat against the flat, bright against the bright, both the rock and the plastered houses threw off the sun glare blindingly. At the very edge of the mesa, overhanging the abyss so that its retaining wall was like a part of the cliff itself, was the old warlike church of Acoma, with its two stone towers. Gaunt, grim, grey, its nave rising some seventy feet to a sagging, half-ruined roof, it was more like a fortress than a place of wor- ship. That spacious interior depressed the Bishop as no other mission church had done. He held a service there before midday, and he had never found it so hard to go through the ceremony of the Mass. Before him, on the grey floor, in the grey light, a group of bright shawls and blankets, some fifty or sixty silent faces; above and behind them the grey walls. He felt as if he were celebrating Mass at the bottom of the sea, for antediluvian creatures; for types of life so old, so hardened, so shut within their shells, that the sacrifice on Calvary could hardly IOI DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP reach back so far. Those shell-like backs behind him might be saved by baptism and divine grace, as un- developed infants are, but hardly through any ex- perience of their own, he thought. When he blessed them and sent them away, it was with a sense of inadequacy and spiritual defeat. After he had laid aside his vestments, Father Latour went over the church with Jacinto. As he examined it his wonder grew. What need had there ever been for this great church at Acoma? It was built early in sixteen hundred, by Fray Juan Ramirez, a great missionary, who laboured on the Rock of Acoma for twenty years or more. It was Father Ramirez, too, who made the mule trail down the other side, the only path by which a burro can ascend the mesa, and which is still called El Camino del Padres The more Father Latour examined this church, the more he was inclined to think that Fray Ramirez, or some Spanish priest who followed him, was not altogether innocent of worldly ambition, and that they built for their own satisfaction, perhaps, rather than according to the needs of the Indians. The magnificent site, the natural grandeur of this strong- hold, might well have turned their heads a little.

Every stone in that struc- 102 THE MASS AT ACOMA ture, every handful of earth in those many thousand pounds of adobe, was carried up the trail on the backs of men and boys and women. And the great carved beams of the roof Father Latour looked at them with amazement. In all the plain through which he had come he had seen no trees but a few stunted pifions. He asked Jacinto where these huge timbers could have been found. San Mateo mountain, I guess. But the San Mateo mountains must be forty or fifty miles away. How could they bring such timbers? Jacinto shrugged. Acomas carry. Certainly there was no other explanation. Besides the church proper there was the cloister, large, thick-walled, which must have required an enormous labour of portage from the plain. The deep cloister corridors were cool when the rock outside was blistering; the low arches opened on an enclosed garden which, judging from its depth of earth, must once have been very verdant. Pacing those shady passages, with four feet of solid, windowless adobe shutting out everything but the green garden and the turquoise sky above, the early missionaries might well have forgotten the poor Acomas, that tribe of ancient rock-turtles, and believed themselves in some cloister hung on a spur of the Pyrenees. . In the grey dust of the enclosed garden two thin, 103 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP half-dead peach trees still struggled with the drouth, the kind of unlikely tree that grows up from an old root and never bears. By the wall yellow suckers put out from an old vine stump, very thick and hard, which must once have borne its ripe clusters. Built upon the north-east corner of the cloister the Bishop found a loggia roofed, but with open sides, looking down on the white pueblo and the tawny rock, and over the wide plain below. There he decided he would spend the night. From this loggia he watched the sun go down; watched the desert become dark, the shadows creep upward. Abroad in the plain the scattered mesa tops, red with the afterglow, one by one lost their light, like candles going out. He was on a naked rock in the desert, in the stone age, a prey to homesickness for his own kind, his own epoch, for European man and his glorious history of desire and dreams. Through all the centuries that his own part of the world had been changing like the sky at daybreak, this people had been fixed, increasing neither in numbers nor desires, rock-turtles on their rock. Something reptilian he felt here, something that had endured by immobility, a kind of life out of reach, like the crustaceans in their armour. On his homeward way the Bishop spent another night with Father Jesus, the good priest at Isleta, who talked with him much of the Moqui country and of those very old rock-set pueblos still farther 104 THE MASS AT ACOMA to the west. One story related to a long-forgotten friar at Acoma, and was somewhat as follows: 4 THE LEGEND OF FRAY BALTAZAR Sour time in the very early years of seventeen hundred, nearly fifty years after the great Indian uprising in which all the missionaries and all the Spaniards in northern New Mexico were either driven out or murdered, after the country had been reconquered and new missionaries had come to take the place of the martyrs, a certain Friar Baltazar Montoya was priest at Acoma. He was of a tyrannical and overbearing disposition and bore a hard hand on the natives. All the missions now in ruins were active then, each had its resident priest, who lived for the people or upon the people, according to his nature. Friar Baltazar was one of the most ambitious and exacting. It was his belief that the pueblo of Acoma existed chiefly to support its fine church, and that this should be the pride of the Indians as it was his. He took the best of their corn and beans and squashes for his table, and selected the choicest portions when 105 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP they slaughtered a sheep, chose their best hides to carpet his dwelling. Moreover, he exacted a heavy tribute in labour. He was never done with having earth carried up from the plain in baskets. He en- larged the churchyard and made the deep garden in the cloister, enriching it with dung from the corrals. Here he was able to grow a wonderful garden, since it was watered every evening by women, and this despite the fact that it was not proper that a woman should ever enter the cloister at all. Each woman owed the Padre",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,31,"so many ollas of water a week from the cisterns, and they murmured not only because of the labour, but because of the drain on their water- supply. Baltazar was not a lazy man, and in his first years there, before he became stout, he made long journeys in behalf of his mission and his garden. He went as far as Oraibi, many days journey, to select their best peach seeds. (The peach orchards of Oraibi were very old, having been cultivated since the days of the earliest Spanish expeditions, when Coronados captains gave the Moquis peach seeds brought from Spain.) His grape cuttings were brought from Sonora in baskets on muleback, and he would go all the way to the Villa (Santa F) for choice garden seeds, at the season when pack trains came up the Rio Grande valley. The early churchmen did a great business in carrying seeds about, though the Indians and 106 THE MASS AT ACOMA Mexicans were satisfied with beans and squashes and chili, asking nothing more. Friar Baltazar was from a religious house in Spain which was noted for good living, and he himself had worked in the refectory. He was an excellent cook and something of a carpenter, and he took a great deal of trouble to make himself comfortable upon that rock at the end of the world. He drafted two Indian boys into his service, one to care for his ass and work in the garden, the other to cook and wait upon him at table. In time, as he grew more unwieldy in figure, he adopted a third boy and em- ployed him as a runner to the distant missions. This boy would go on foot all the way to the Villa for red cloth or an iron spade or a new knife, stopping at Bernalillo to bring home a wineskin full of grape brandy. He would go five days journey to the Sandia mountains to catch fish and dry or salt them for the Padres fast-days, or run to Zufii, where the Fathers raised rabbits, and bring back a pair for the spit. His errands were seldom of an ecclesiastical nature. It was clear that the Friar at Acoma lived more after the flesh than after the spirit. The diffi- culty of obtaining an interesting and varied diet on a naked rock seemed only to whet his appetite and tempt his resourcefulness. But his sensuality went no further than his garden and table. Carnal commerce 107 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP with the Indian women would have been very easy indeed, and the Friar was at the hardy age of ripe manhood when such temptations are peculiarly sharp. But the missionaries had early discovered that the slightest departure from chastity greatly weakened their influence and authority with their Indian converts. The Indians themselves sometimes practised continence as a penance, or as a strong medicine with the spirits, and they were very willing that their Padre should practise it for them. The consequences of carnal indulgence were perhaps more serious here than in Spain, and Friar Baltazar seems never to have given his flock an opportunity to exult over his frailty. He held his seat at Acoma for nearly fifteen pros- perous years, constantly improving his church and his living-quarters, growing new vegetables and medicinal herbs, making soap from the yucca root. Even after he became stout, his arms were strong and muscular, his fingers clever. He cultivated his peach trees, and watched over his garden like a little kingdom, never allowing the native women to grow slack in the water-supply. His first serving-boys were released to marry, and others succeeded them, who were even more minutely trained. Baltazars tyranny grew little by little, and the Acoma people were sometimes at the point of revolt. But they could not estimate just how powerful the 108 THE MASS AT ACOMA Padres magic might be and were afraid to put it to the test. There was no doubt that the holy picture of St. Joseph had come to them from the King of Spain by the request of this Padre, and that picture had been more effective in averting drouth than all the native rain-makers had been. Properly entreated and honoured, the painting had never failed to produce rain. Acoma had not lost its crops since Friar Baltazar first brought the picture to them, though at Laguna and Zufii there had been drouths that compelled the people to live upon their famine store, an alarming extremity. The Laguna Indians were constantly sending le- gations to Acoma to negotiate terms at which they could rent the holy picture, but Friar Baltazar had warned them never to let it go. If such powerful protection were withdrawn, or if the Padre should turn the magic",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,32,"against them, the consequences might be disastrous to the pueblo. Better give him his choice of grain and lambs and pottery, and allow him his three serving-boys. So the missionary and his converts rubbed along in seeming friendliness. One summer the Friar, who did not make long journeys now that he had grown large in girth, de- cided that he would like company, someone to admire his fine garden, his ingenious kitchen, his airy loggia with its rugs and water jars, where he meditated and took his after-dinner siesta. So he 109 _ DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP planned to give a dinner party in the week after St. Johns Day. He sent his runner to Zufi, Laguna, Isleta, and bade the Padres to a feast. They came upon the day, four of them, for there were two priests at Zufi. The stable-boy was stationed at the foot of the rock to take their beasts and conduct the visitors up the stairway. At the head of the trail Baltazar received them. They were shown over the place, and spent the morning gossiping in the cloister walks, cool and silent, though the naked rock outside was almost too hot for the hand to touch. The vine leaves rustled agreeably in the breeze, and the earth about the carrot and onion tops, as it dried from last nights watering, gave off a pleasant smell. The guests thought their host lived very well, and they wished they had his secret. If he was a trifle boastful of his air-bound seat, no one could blame him. With the dinner, Baltazar had taken extravagant pains. The monastery in which he had learned to cook was off the main highway to Seville; the Spanish nobles and the King himself sometimes stopped there for entertainment. In that great kitchen, with its multiplicity of spits, small enough to roast a lark and large enough to roast a boar, the Friar had learned a thing or two about sauces, and in his lonely years at Acoma he had bettered his instruction by a natural aptitude for the art. The 110 THE MASS AT ACOMA poverty of materials had proved an incentive rather than a discouragement. Certainly the visiting missionaries had never sat down to food like that which rejoiced them to-day in the cool refectory, the blinds open just enough to admit a streak of throbbing desert far below them. Their host was telling them pompously that he would have a fountain in the cloister close when they came again. He had to check his hungry guests in their zeal for the relishes and the soup, warning them to save their mettle for what was to come. The roast was to be a wild turkey, superbly done but that, alas, was never tasted. The course which preceded it was the hosts especial care, and here he had trusted nothing to his cook; hare jardinire (his carrots and onions were tender and well flavoured), with a sauce which he had been perfecting for many years. This entre was brought from the kitchen in a large earthen dish but not large enough, for with its luxury of sauce and floating carrots it filled the platter to the brim. The stable-boy was serving to- day, as the cook could not leave his spits, and he had been neat, brisk, and efficient. The Friar was pleased with him, and was wondering whether he could not find some little medal of bronze or silver- gilt to reward him for his pains. When the hare in its sauce came on, the priest from Isleta chanced to be telling a funny story at III DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP which the company were laughing uproariously. The serving-boy, who knew a little Spanish, was apparently trying to get the point of the recital which made the Padres so merry. At any rate, he became distracted, and as he passed behind the senior priest of Zufi, he tipped his full platter and spilled a stream of rich brown gravy over the good mans head and shoulders. Baltazar was quick- tempered, and he had been drinking freely of the fiery grape brandy. He caught up the empty pewter mug at his right and threw it at the clumsy lad with a malediction. It struck the boy on the side of the head. He dropped the platter, staggered a few steps, and fell down. He did not get up, nor did he move. The Padre from Zuni was skilled in medicine. Wip- ing the sauce from his eyes, he bent over the boy and examined him. Muerto, he whispered. With that he plucked his junior priest by the sleeve, and the two bolted across the garden without another word and made for the head of the stairway. In a moment",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,33,"the Padres of Laguna and Isleta unceremoniously followed their example. With remarkable speed the four guests got them down from the rock, saddled their mules, and urged them across the plain. Baltazar was left alone with the consequences of his haste. Unfortunately the cook, astonished at the prolonged silence, had looked in at the door just as 112 THE MASS AT ACOMA the last pair of brown gowns were vanishing across the cloister. He saw his comrade lying upon the floor, and silently disappeared from the premises by an exit known only to himself. When Friar Baltazar went into the kitchen he found it solitary, the turkey still dripping on the spit. Certainly he had no appetite for the roast. He felt, indeed, very remorseful and uncomfortable, also indignant with his departed guests. For a moment he entertained the idea of following them; but a temporary flight would only weaken his po- sition, and a permanent evacuation was not to be thought of. His garden was at its prime, his peaches were just coming ripe, and his vines hung heavy with green clusters. Mechanically he took the turkey from the spit, not because he felt any inclination for food, but from an instinct of compassion, quite as if the bird could suffer from being burned to a crisp. This done, he repaired to his loggia and sat down to read his breviary, which he had neglected for several days, having been so occupied in the refectory. He had begrudged no pains to that sauce which had been his undoing. The airy loggia, where he customarily took his afternoon repose, was like a birdcage hung in the breeze. Through its open archways he looked down on the huddled pueblo, and out over the great mesa-strewn plain far below. He was unable to fix 113 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP his mind upon his office. The pueblo down there was much too quiet. At this hour there should be a few women washing pots or rags, a few children playing by the cisterns and chasing the turkeys. But to-day the rock top baked in the fire of the sun in utter silence, not one human being was visible yes, one, though he had not been there a moment ago. At the head of the stone stairway, there was a patch of lustrous black, just above the rocks; an Indians hair. They had set a guard at the trail head. Now the Padre began to feel alarmed, to wish he had gone down that stairway with the others, while there was yet time. He wished he were anywhere in the world but on this rock. There was old Father Ramirezs donkey path; but if the Indians were watching one road, they would watch the other. The spot of black hair never stirred; and there were but those two ways down to the plain, only those . .. Whichever way one turned, three hundred and fifty feet of naked cliff, without one tree or shrub a man could cling to. As the sun sank lower and lower, there began a deep, singing murmur of male voices from the pueblo below him, not a chant, but the rhythmical intona- tion of Indian oratory when a serious matter is under discussion. Frightful stories of the torture of the missionaries in the great rebellion of 1680 flashed into Friar Baltazars mind; how one Franciscan had 114 THE MASS AT ACOMA his eyes torn out, another had been burned, and the old Padre at Jamez had been stripped naked and driven on all fours about the plaza all night, with drunken Indians straddling his back, until he rolled over dead from exhaustion. Moonrise from the loggia was an impressive sight, even to this Brother who was not over-impression- able. But to-night he wished he could keep the moon from coming up through the floor of the desert, the moon was the clock which began things in the pueblo. He watched with horror for that golden rim against the deep blue velvet of the night. The moon came, and at its coming the Acoma people issued from their doors. A company of men walked silently across the rock to the cloister. They came up the ladder and appeared in the loggia. The Friar asked them gruffly what they wanted, but they made no reply. Not once speaking to him or to each other, they bound his feet together and tied his arms to his sides. The Acoma people told afterwards that he did not supplicate or struggle; had he done so, they might have dealt more cruelly with him. But he knew his Indians, and that when once they had collectively . Moreover, he made up their pueblo mind . was a proud old Spaniard, and had a certain",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP he retained the respect of his Indian vassals to the end. They carried him down the ladder and through the cloister and across the rock to the most precipitous cliff the one over which the Acoma women flung broken pots and such refuse as the turkeys would not eat. There the people were assembled. They cut his bonds, and taking him by the hands and feet, swung him out over the rock-edge and back a few times. He was heavy, and perhaps they thought this dangerous sport. No sound but hissing breath came through his teeth. The four executioners took him up again from the brink where they had laid him, and, after a few feints, dropped him in mid-air. So did they rid their rock of their tyrant, whom on the whole they had liked very well. But everything has its day. The execution was not followed by any sacrilege to the church or defiling of holy vessels, but merely by a division of the Padres stores and house- hold goods. The women, indeed, took pleasure in watching the garden pine and waste away from thirst, and ventured into the cloisters to laugh and chatter at the whitening foliage of the peach trees, and the green grapes shrivelling on the vines. When the next priest came, years afterward, he found no ill will awaiting him. He was a native Mexican, of unpretentious tastes, who was well satisfied with beans and jerked meat, and let the 116 THE MASS AT ACOMA pueblo turkey flock scratch in the hot dust that had once been Baltazars garden. The old peach stumps kept sending up pale sprouts for many years. 117 BOM) KY F OUR SNAKE ROOT I THE NIGHTOAT.2C0S. MONTH after the Bishops visit to Albuquer- que and Acoma, the genial Father Gallegos was formally suspended, and Father Vaillant himself took charge of the parish. At first there was bitter feeling; the rich rancheros and the merry ladies of Albuquerque were very hostile to the French priest. He began his reforms at once. Everything was changed. The holy-days, which had been occasions of revelry under Padre Gallegos, were now days of austere devotion. The fickle Mexican population soon found as much diversion in being devout as they had once found in being scandalous. Father Vaillant wrote to his sister Philomne, in France, that the temper of his parish was like that of a boys school; under one master the lads try to excel one another in mis- chief and disobedience, under another they vie with each other in acts of loyalty. The Novena preceding 118 SNAKE ROOT Christmas, which had long been celebrated by dances and hilarious merry-making, was this year a great revival of religious zeal. Though Father Vaillant had all the duties of a parish priest at Albuquerque, he was still Vicar General, and in February the Bishop dispatched him on urgent business to Las Vegas. He did not return on the day that he was expected, and when several days passed with no word from him, Father Latour began to feel some anxiety. One morning at day-break a very sick Indian boy rode into the Bishops courtyard on Father Josephs white mule, Contento, bringing bad news. The Padre, he said, had stopped at his village in the Pecos moun- tains where black measles had broken out, to give the sacrament to the dying, and had fallen ill of the sickness. The boy himself had been well when he started for Santa F, but had become sick on the way. The Bishop had the messenger put into the wood- house, an isolated building at the end of the garden, where the Sisters of Loretto could tend him. He instructed the Mother Superior to pack a bag with such medicines and comforts for the sick as he could carry, and told Fructosa, his cook, to put up for him the provisions he usually took on horseback journeys. When his man brought a pack-mule and his own mule, Angelica, to the door, Father Latour, already in his rough riding-breeches and buckskin II9Q DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP jacket, looked at the handsome beast and shook his head. No, leave her with Contento. The new army mule is heavier, and will do for this journey. The Bishop rode out of Santa F two hours after the Indian messenger rode in. He was going direct to the pueblo of Pecos, where he would pick up Ja- cinto. It was late in the afternoon when he reached the pueblo, lying low on its red rock ledges, half- surrounded by a crown of fir-clad mountains, and facing a sea of junipers and cedars. The",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,35,"Bishop had meant to get fresh horses at Pecos and push on through the mountains, but Jacinto and the older Indians who gathered about the horseman, strongly advised him to spend the night there and start in the early morning. The sun was shining brilliantly in a blue sky, but in the west, behind the mountain, lay a great stationary black cloud, opaque and motionless as a ledge of rock. The old men looked at it and shook their heads. Very big wind, said the governor gravely. Unwillingly the Bishop dismounted and gave his mules to Jacinto; it seemed to him that he was wasting time. There was still an hour before night- fall, and he spent that hour pacing up and down the crust of bare rock between the village and the ruin of the old mission church. The sun was sinking, a red ball which threw a copper glow over the pine- 120 SNAKE ROOT covered ridge of mountains, and edged that inky, ominous cloud with molten silver. The great red earth walls of the mission, red as brick-dust, yawned gloomily before him, part of the roof had fallen in, and the rest would soon go. At this moment Father Joseph was lying danger- ously ill in the dirt and discomfort of an Indian vil- lage in winter. Why, the Bishop was asking himself, had he ever brought his friend to this life of hardship and danger? Father Vaillant had been frail from child- hood, though he had the endurance resulting from ex- haustless enthusiasm. The Brothers at Montferrand were not given to coddling boys, but every year they used to send this one away for a rest in the high Vol- vic mountains, because his vitality ran down under the confinement of college life. Twice, while he and Father Latour were missionaries in Ohio, Joseph had been at deaths door; once so ill with cholera that the newspapers had printed his name in the death list. On that occasion their Ohio Bishop had christened him Trompe-la-Mort. Yes, Father Latour told him- self, Blanchet had outwitted death so often, there was always the chance he would do it again. Walking about the walls of the ruin, the Bishop discovered that the sacristy was dry and clean, and he decided to spend the night there, wrapped in his blankets, on one of the earthen benches that ran about the inner walls. While he was exam- 121 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP ining this room, the wind began to howl about the old church, and. darkness fell quickly. From the low doorways of the pueblo ruddy fire-light was gleaming singularly grateful to the eye. Waiting for him on the rocks, he recognized the slight figure of Jacinto, his blanket drawn close about his head, his shoulders bowed to the wind. The young Indian said that supper was ready, and the Bishop followed him to his particular lair in those rows of little houses all alike and all built together. There was a ladder before Jacintos door which led up to a second storey, but that was the dwelling of another family; the roof of Jacintos house made a veranda for the family above him. The Bishop bent his head under the low doorway and stepped down; the floor of the room was a long step below the door- sill the Indian way of preventing drafts. The room into which he descended was long and narrow, smoothly whitewashed, and clean, to the eye, at least, because of its very bareness. There was nothing on the walls but a few fox pelts and strings of gourds and red peppers. The richly coloured blankets of which Jacinto was very proud were folded in piles on the earth settle, it was there he and his wife slept, near the fire-place. The earth of that settle became warm during the day and held its heat until morning, like the Russian peasants stove-bed. Over the fire a pot of beans and dried meat was simmering. I22 SNAKE ROOT The burning pifion logs filled the room with sweet- smelling smoke. Clara, Jacintos wife, smiled at the priest as he entered. She ladled out the stew, and the Bishop and Jacinto sat down on the floor beside the fire, each with his bowl. Between them Clara put a basin full of hot corn-bread baked with squash seeds, an Indian delicacy comparable to raisin bread among the whites. The Bishop said a blessing and broke the bread with his hands. While the two men ate, the young woman watched them and stirred a tiny cradle of deerskin which hung by thongs from the roof poles. Jacinto, when questioned, said sadly that the baby was ailing. Father Latour did not ask to see it; it would be swathed in layers",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,36,"of wrappings, he knew; even its face and head would be covered against drafts. Indian babies were never bathed in winter, and it was useless to suggest treatment for the sick ones. On that subject the Indian ear was closed to advice. It was a pity, too, that he could do nothing for Jacintos baby. Cradles were not many in the pueblo of Pecos. The tribe was dying out; infant mortality was heavy, and the young couples did not reproduce freely, the life-force seemed low. Smallpox and measles had taken heavy toll here time and again. Of course there were other explanations, credited by many good people in Santa F. Pecos had more than its share of dark legends, perhaps that was 123 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP because it had been too tempting to white men, and had had more than its share of history. It was said that this people had from time immemorial kept a ceremonial fire burning in some cave in the mountain, a fire that had never been allowed to go out, and had never been revealed to white men. The story was that the service of this fire sapped the strength of the young men appointed to serve it, always the best of the tribe. Father Latour thought this hardly probable. Why should it be very arduous, in a mountain full of timber, to feed a fire so small that its whereabouts had been concealed for centuries? There was also the snake story, reported by the early explorers, both Spanish and American, and believed ever since: that this tribe was peculiarly addicted to snake worship, that they kept rattle- snakes concealed in their houses, and somewhere in the mountain guarded an enormous serpent which they brought to the pueblo for certain feasts. It was said that they sacrificed young babies to the great snake, and thus diminished their numbers. It seemed much more likely that the contagious diseases brought by white men were the real cause of the shrinkage of the tribe. Among the Indians, measles, scarlatina and whooping-cough were as deadly as typhus or cholera. Certainly, the tribe was decreasing every year. Jacintos house was at one end of the living pueblo; behind it were long rock ridges 124 SNAKE ROOT of dead pueblo, empty houses ruined by weather and now scarcely more than piles of earth and stone. The population of the living streets was less than one hundred adults.* This was all that was left of the rich and populous Cicuy of Coronados expedition. Then, by his report, there were six thousand souls in the Indian town. They had rich fields irrigated from the Pecos River. The streams were full of fish, the moun- tain was full of game. The pueblo, indeed, seemed to lie upon the knees of these verdant mountains, like a favoured child. Out yonder, on the juniper-spotted plateau in front of the village, the Spaniards had camped, exacting a heavy tribute of corn and furs and cotton garments from their hapless hosts. It was from here, the story went, that they set forth in the spring on their ill-fated search for the seven golden cities of Quivera, taking with them slaves and concubines ravished from the Pecos people. As Father Latour sat by the fire and listened to the wind sweeping down from the mountains and howl- ing over the plateau, he thought of these things; and he could not help wondering whether Jacinto, sitting silent by the same fire, was thinking of them, too. The wind, he knew, was blowing out of the inky cloud bank that lay behind the mountain at sunset; but it might well be blowing out of a remote, black * In actual fact, the dying pueblo of Pecos was abandoned some years before the American occupation of New Mexico. 125 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP past. The only human voice raised against it was the feeble wailing of the sick child in the cradle. Clara ate noiselessly in a corner, Jacinto looked into the fire. The Bishop read his breviary by the fire-light for an hour. Then, warmed to the bone and assured that his roll of blankets was warmed through, he rose to go. Jacinto followed with the blankets and one of his own buffalo robes. They went along a line of red doorways and across the bare rock to the gaunt ruin, whose lateral walls, with their buttresses, still braved the storm and let in the starlight. 2 STONE LIPS I. was not difficult for the Bishop to waken early. After midnight his body became more and more chilled and cramped. He said his prayers before he rolled out of his blankets, remembering Father Vaillants maxim that if you said your prayers first, you would find plenty of time",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,37,"for other things after- ward. 126 SNAKE ROOT Going through the silent pueblo to Jacintos door, the Bishop woke him and asked him to make a fire. While the Indian went to get the mules ready, Father Latour got his coffee-pot and tin cup out of his saddle-bags, and a round loaf of Mexican bread. With bread and black coffee, he could travel day after day. Jacinto was for starting without breakfast, but Father Latour made him sit down and share his loaf. Bread is never too plenty in Indian households. Clara was still lying on the settle with her baby. At four oclock they were on the road, Jacinto rid- ing the mule that carried the blankets. He knew the trails through his own mountains well enough to follow them in the dark. Toward noon the Bishop suggested a halt to rest the mules, but his guide looked at the sky and shook his head. The sun was nowhere to be seen, the air was thick and grey and smelled of snow. Very soon the snow began to jail lightly at first, but all the while becoming heavier. The vista of pine trees ahead of them grew shorter and shorter through the vast powdering of descending flakes. A little after midday a burst of wind sent the snow whirling in coils about the two travellers, and a great storm broke. The wind was like a hurricane at sea, and the air became blind with snow. The Bishop could scarcely see his guide saw only parts of him, now a head, now a shoulder, now only the black rump of his mule. Pine trees by the way stood out for a 127 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP moment, then disappeared absolutely in the whirlpool of snow. Trail and landmarks, the mountain itself, were obliterated. Jacinto sprang from his mule and unstrapped the roll of blankets. Throwing the saddle-bags to the Bishop, he shouted, Come, I know a place. Be quick, Padre. The Bishop protested they could not leave the mules. Jacinto said the mules must take their chance. For Father Latour the next hour was a test of endurance. He was blind and breathless, panting through his open mouth. He clambered over half- visible rocks, fell over prostrate trees, sank into deep holes and struggled out, always following the red blankets on the shoulders of the Indian boy, which stuck out when the boy himself was lost to sight. Suddenly the snow seemed thinner. The guide stopped short. They were standing, the Bishop made out, under an overhanging wall of rock whieh made a barrier against the storm. Jacinto dropped the blankets from his shoulder and seemed to be preparing to climb the cliff. Looking up, the Bishop saw a peculiar formation in the rocks; two rounded ledges, one directly over the other, with a mouth-like opening between. They suggested two great stone lips, slightly parted and thrust outward. Up to this mouth Jacinto climbed quickly by footholds well known to him. Having mounted, he lay down on the 128 % SNAKE ROOT lower lip, and helped the Bishop to clamber up. He told Father Latour to wait for him on this projection while he brought up the baggage. A few moments later the Bishop slid after Jacinto and the blankets, through the orifice, into the throat of the cave. Within stood a wooden ladder, like that used in kivas, and down this he easily made his way to the floor. He found himself in a lofty cavern, shaped some- what like a Gothic chapel, of vague outline, the only light within was that which came through the narrow aperture between the stone lips. Great as was his need of shelter, the Bishop, on his way down the ladder, was struck by a reluctance, an extreme distaste for the place. The air in the cave was glacial, penetrated to the very bones, and he detected at once a fetid odour, not very strong but highly disagree- able. Some twenty feet or so above his head the open mouth let in grey daylight like a high transom. While he stood gazing about, trying to reckon the size of the cave, his guide was intensely pre- occupied in making a careful examination of the floor and walls. At the foot of the ladder lay a heap of half-burned logs. There had been a fire there, and it had been extinguished with fresh earth, a pile of dust covered what had been the heart of the fire. Against the cavern wall was a heap of-pifion faggots, neatly piled. After he had made a minute examina- 129 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP tion of the floor, the guide began cautiously to move this pile of wood, taking the sticks up one by one, and",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,38,"putting them in another spot. The Bishop sup- posed he would make a fire at once, but he seemed in no haste to do so. Indeed, when he had moved the wood he sat down upon the floor and fell into re- flection. Father Latour urged him to build a fire without further delay. Padre, said the Indian boy, I do not know if it was right to bring you here. This place is used by my people for ceremonies and is known only to us. When you go out from here, you must forget. T will forget, certamly. But unless we can have a fire, we had better go back into the storm. I feel ill here already. Jacinto unrolled the blankets and threw the dryest one about the shivering priest. Then he bent over the pile of ashes and charred wood, but what he did was to select a number of small stones that had been used to fence in the burning embers. These he gathered in his serape and carried to the rear wall of the cavern, where, a little above his head, there seemed to be a hole. It was about as large as a very big watermelon, of an irregular oval shape. Holes of that shape are common in the black vol- canic cliffs of the Pajarito Plateau, where they occur in great numbers. This one was solitary, dark, and seemed to lead into another cavern. Though it lay 130 SNAKE ROOT higher than Jacintos head, it was not beyond easy reach of his arms, and to the Bishops astonishment he began deftly and noiselessly to place the stones he had collected within the mouth of this orifice, fitting them together until he had entirely closed it. He then cut wedges from the pifion faggots and inserted them into the cracks between the stones. Finally, he took a handful of the earth that had been used to smother the dead fire, and mixed it with the wet snow that had blown in between the stone lips. With this thick mud he plastered over his masonry, and smoothed it with his palm. The whole operation did not take a quarter of an hour. Without comment or explanation he then pro- ceeded to build a fire. The odour so disagreeable to the Bishop soon vanished before the fragrance of the burning logs. The heat seemed to purify the rank air at the same time that it took away the deathly chill, but the dizzy noise in Father Latours head per- sisted. At first he thought it was a vertigo, a roaring in his ears brought on by cold and changes in his circulation. But as he grew warm and relaxed, he perceived an extraordinary vibration in this cavern; it hummed like a hive of bees, like a heavy roll of distant drums. After a time he asked Jacinto whether he, too, noticed this. The slim Indian boy smiled for the first time since they had entered the cave. He took up a faggot for a torch, and beckoned the Padre 131 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP to follow him along a tunnel which ran back into the mountain, where the roof grew much lower, almost within reach of the hand. There Jacinto knelt down over a fissure in the stone floor, like a crack in china, which was plastered up with clay. Digging some of this out with his hunting knife, he put his ear on the opening, listened a few seconds, and motioned the Bishop to do likewise. Father Latour lay with his ear to this crack for a long while, despite the cold that arose from it. He told himself he was listening to one of the oldest voices of the earth. What he heard was the sound of a great underground river, flowing through a resounding cavern. The water was far, far below, perhaps as deep as the foot of the mountain, a flood moving in utter blackness under ribs of antediluvian rock. It was not a rushing noise, but the sound of a great flood moving with majesty and power. Tt is terrible, he said at last, as he rose. Si, Padre. Jacinto began spitting on the clay he had gouged out of the seam, and plastered it up again. When they returned to the fire, the patch of day- light up between the two lips had grown much paler. The Bishop saw it die with regret. He took from his saddle-bags his coffee-pot and a loaf of bread and a goat cheese. Jacinto climbed up to the lower ledge of the entrance, shook a pine tree, and filled the coffee- 132 SNAKE ROOT pot and one of the blankets with fresh snow. While his guide was thus engaged, the Bishop took a",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,39,"swallow of old Taos whisky from his pocket flask. He never liked to drink spirits in the presence of an Indian. Jacinto declared that he thought himself lucky to get bread and black coffee. As he handed the Bishop back his tin cup after drinking its contents, he rubbed his hand over his wide sash with a smile of pleasure that showed all his white teeth. We had good luck to be near here, he said. When we leave the mules, I think I can find my way here, but I am not sure. I have not been here very many times. You was scare, Padre? The Bishop reflected. You hardly gave me time to be scared, boy. Were you? The Indian shrugged his shoulders. I think not to return to pueblo, he admitted. Father Latour read his breviary long by the light of the fire. Since early morning his mind had been on other than spiritual things. At last he felt that he could sleep. He made Jacinto repeat a Pater Noster with him, as he always did on their night camps, rolled himself in his blankets, and stretched out, feet to the fire. He had it in his mind, however, to waken in the night and study a little the curious hole his guide had so carefully closed. After he put on the mud, Jacinto had never looked in the direction of 133 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP that hole again, and Father Latour, observing Indian good manners, had tried not to glance toward it. He did waken, and the fire was still giving off a rich glow of light in that lofty Gothic chamber. But there against the wall was his guide, standing on some invisible foothold, his arms outstretched against the rock, his body flattened against it, his ear over that patch of fresh mud, listening; listening with supersensual ear, it seemed, and he looked to be supported against the rock by the intensity of his solicitude. The Bishop closed his eyes without making a sound and wondered why he had supposed he could catch his guide asleep. The next morning they crawled out through the stone lips, and dropped into a gleaming white world. The snow-clad mountains were red in the rising sun. The Bishop stood looking down over ridge after ridge of wintry fir trees with the tender morning breaking over them, all their branches laden with soft, rose- coloured clouds of virgin snow. Jacinto said it would not be worth while to look for the mules. When the snow melted, he would re- cover the saddles and bridles. They floundered on foot some eight miles to a squatters cabin, rented horses, and completed their journey by starlight. When they reached Father Vaillant, he was sitting up in a bed of buffalo skins, his fever broken, already 134 SNAKE ROOT on the way to recovery. Another good friend had reached him before the Bishop. Kit Carson, on a deer hunt in the mountains with two Taos Indians, had heard that this village was stricken and that the Vicario was there. He hurried to the rescue, and got into the pueblo with a pack of venison meat just before the storm broke. As soon as Father Vaillant could sit in the saddle, Carson and the Bishop took him back to Santa F, breaking the journey into four days because of his enfeebled state. The Bishop kept his word, and never spoke of Jacintos cave to anyone, but he did not cease from wondering about it. It flashed into his mind from time to time, and always with a shudder of repugnance quite unjustified by anything he had experienced there. It had been a hospitable shelter to him in his extremity. Yet afterward he remembered the storm itself, even his exhaustion, with a tingling sense of pleasure. But the cave, which had probably saved his life, he remembered with horror. No tales of wonder, he told himself, would ever tempt him into a cavern hereafter. At home again, in his own house, he still felt a certain curiosity about this ceremonial cave, and Jacintos puzzling behaviour. It seemed almost to lend a colour of probability to some of those un- pleasant stories about the Pecos religion. He was 135 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP already convinced that neither the white men nor the Mexicans in Santa F understood anything about Indian beliefs or the workings of the Indian mind. Kit Carson had told him that the proprietor of the trading post between Glorieta Pass and the Pecos pueblo had grown up a neighbour to these Indians, and knew as much about them as anybody. His parents had kept the trading post before him, and his mother was the first white woman in that neighborhood. The traders",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,40,"name was Zeb Orchard; he lived alone in the mountains, selling salt and sugar and whisky and tobacco to red men and white. Carson said that he was honest and truthful, a good friend to the Indians, and had at one time wanted to marry a Pecos girl, but his old mother, who was very proud of being white, would not hear to it, and so he had remained a single man and a recluse. Father Latour made a point of stopping for the night with this trader on one of his missionary jour- neys, in order to question him about the Pecos cus- toms and ceremonies. Orchard said that the legend about the undying fire was unquestionably true; but it was kept burning, not in the mountain, but in their own pueblo. It was a smothered fire in a clay oven, and had been burning in one of the kivas ever since the pueblo was founded, centuries ago. About the snake stories, he was not certain. He had seen rattlesnakes around the pueblo, 136 SNAKE ROOT to be sure, but there were rattlers everywhere. A Pecos boy had been bitten on the ankle some years ago, and had come to him for whisky; he swelled up and was very sick, like any other boy. The Bishop asked Orchard if he thought it probable that the Indians kept a great serpent in concealment somewhere, as was commonly reported. They do keep some sort of varmint out in the mountain, that they bring in for their religious ceremonies, the trader said. But I dont know if its a snake or not. No white man knows anything about Indian religion, Padre. As they talked further, Orchard admitted that when he was a boy he had been very curious about these snake stories himself, and once, at their festival time, he had spied on the Pecos men, though that was not a very safe thing to do. He had lain in ambush for two nights on the mountain, and he saw a party of Indians bringing in a chest by torchlight. It was about the size of a womans trunk, and it was heavy enough to bend the young aspen poles on which it was hung. If Id seen white men bringing in a chest after dark, he observed, I could have made a guess at what was in it; money, or whisky, or fire-arms. But seeing it was Indians, I cant say. It might have been only queer-shaped rocks their ancestors had taken a notion to. The things they value most are worth nothing to us. Theyve 137 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP got their own superstitions, and their minds will go round and round in the same old ruts till Judg- ment Day. Father Latour remarked that their veneration for old customs was a quality he liked in the Indians, and that it played a great part in his own religion. The trader told him he might make good Catholics among the Indians, but he would never separate them from their own beliefs. Their priests have their own kind of mysteries. I dont know how much of it is real and how much is made up. I re- member something that happened when I was a little fellow. One night a Pecos girl, with her baby in her arms, ran into the kitchen here and begged my mother to hide her until after the festival, for shed seen signs between the cacigues, and was sure they were going to feed her baby to the snake. Whether it was true or not, she certainly believed it, poor thing, and Mother let her stay. It made a great impression on me at the time. 138 BOOK FIVE PADRE MARTINEZ I THE OLD ORDER ISHOP LATOUR, with Jacinto, was riding through the mountains on his first official visit to Taosafter Albuquerque, the largest and richest parish in his diocese. Both the priest and people there were hostile to Americans and jealous of interference. Any European, except a Spaniard, was regarded as a gringo. The Bishop had let the parish alone, giving their animosity plenty of time to cool. With Carsons help he had informed himself fully about conditions there, and about the powerful old priest, Antonio Jos Martinez, who was ruler in temporal as well as in spiritual affairs. Indeed, be- fore Father Latours entrance upon the scene, Martinez had been dictator to all the parishes in northern New Mexico, and the native priests at Santa F were all of them under his thumb. It was common talk that Padre Martinez had 139 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP instigated the revolt of-the Taos Indians five years ago, when Bent, the American Governor, and a dozen other white men were murdered and scalped. Seven of",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,41,"the Taos Indians had been tried before a military court and hanged for the murder, but no attempt had been made to call the plotting priest to account. Indeed, Padre Martinez had managed to profit considerably by the affair. The Indians who were sentenced to death had sent for their Padre and begged him to get them out of the trouble he had got them into. Martinez promised to save their lives if they would deed him their lands, near the pueblo. This they did, and after the conveyance was properly executed the Padre troubled himself no more about the matter, but went to pay a visit at his native town of Abiquiu. In his absence the seven Indians were hanged on the appointed day. Martinez now cultivated their fertile farms, which made him quite the richest man in the parish. Father Latour had had polite correspondence with Martinez, but had met him only once, on that memorable occasion when the Padre had ridden up from Taos to strengthen the Santa F clergy in their refusal to recognize the new Bishop. But he could see him as if that were only yesterday, the priest of Taos was not a man one would easily forget. One could not have passed him on the street without feeling his 140 PADRE MARTINEZ great physical force and his imperious will. Not much taller than the Bishop in reality, he gave the impres- sion of being an enormous man. His broad high shoul- ders were like a bull buffalos, his big head was set defiantly on a thick neck, and the full-cheeked, richly coloured, egg-shaped Spanish face how vividly the Bishop remembered that face! It was so unusual that he would be glad to see it again; a high, narrow fore- head, brilliant yellow eyes set deep in strong arches, and full, florid cheeks, not blank areas of smooth flesh, as in Anglo-Saxon faces, but full of muscular activity, as quick to change with feeling as any of his features. His mouth was the very assertion of violent, uncurbed passions and tyrannical self-will; the full lips thrust out and taut, like the flesh of animals distended by fear or desire. Father Latour judged that the day of lawless personal power was almost over, even on the frontier, and this figure was to him already like something picturesque and impressive, but really impotent, left over from the past. The Bishop and Jacinto left the mountains behind them, the trail dropped to a plain covered by clumps of very old sage-brush, with trunks as thick as a mans leg. Jacinto pointed out a cloud of dust moving rapidly toward them, a cavalcade of a hundred men or more, Indians and Mexicans, come out to welcome their Bishop with shouting and musketry. 141 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP As the horsemen approached, Padre Martinez him- self was easily distinguishable in buckskin breeches, high boots and silver spurs, a wide Mexican hat on his head, and a great black cape wound about his shoul- ders like a shepherds plaid. He rode up to the Bishop and reining in his black gelding, uncovered his head in a broad salutation, while his escort surrounded the churchmen and fired their muskets into the air. The two priests rode side by side into Los Ranchos de Taos, a little town of yellow walls and winding streets and green orchards. The inhabitants were all gathered in the square before the church. When the Bishop dismounted to enter the church, the women threw their shawls on the dusty pathway for him to walk upon, and as he passed through the kneeling congregation, men and women snatched for his hand to kiss the Episcopal ring. In his own country all this would have been highly distasteful to Jean Marie Latour. Here, these demonstrations seemed a part of the high colour that was in landscape and gardens, in the flaming cactus and the gaudily decorated Christs and dolorous altars, in the agonized Virgins and the very human figures of the saints. He had already learned that with this people re- ligion was necessarily theatrical. From Los Ranchos the party rode quickly across the grey plain into Taos itself, to the priests house, opposite the church, where a great throng had 142 | PADRE MARTINEZ collected. As the people sank on their knees, one boy, a gawky lad of ten or twelve, remained standing, his mouth open and his hat on his head. Padre Martinez reached over the heads of several kneeling women, snatched off the boys cap, and cuffed him soundly about the ears. When Father Latour murmured in protest, the native priest said boldly: He is my own son, Bishop, and it is time I taught him manners. So this was to be the tune, the",no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,42,"Bishop reflected. His well-schooled countenance did not change a> shadow as he received this challenge, and he passed on into the Padres house. They went at once into Martinezs study, where they found a young man lying on the floor, fast asleep. He was a very large young man, very stout, lying on his back with his head pillowed on a book, and as he breathed his bulk rose and fell amazingly. He wore a Franciscans brown gown, and his hair was clipped short. At sight of the sleeper, Padre Martinez broke into a laugh and gave him a no very gentle kick in the ribs. The fellow got to his feet in great confusion, escaping through a door into the patio. You there, the Padre called after him, only young men who work hard at night want to sleep in the day! You must have been studying by candle- light. Pll give you an examination in theology! This was greeted by a titter of feminine laughter 143 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP from the windows across the court, where the fugi- tive took refuge behind a washing hung out to dry. He bent his tall, full figure and disappeared between a pair of wet sheets. That was my student, Trinidad, said Martinez, a nephew of my old friend Father Lucero, at Arroyo Hondo. Hes a monk, but we want him to take orders. We sent him to the Seminary in Durango, but he was either too homesick or too stupid to learn anything, so Im teaching him here. We shall make a priest of him one day. Father Latour was told to consider the house his own, but he had no wish to. The disorder was almost more than his fastidious taste could bear. The Padres study table was sprinkled with snuff, and piled so high with books that they almost hid the crucifix hanging behind it. Books were heaped on chairs and tables all over the house, and the books and the floors were deep in the dust of spring sand- storms. Father Martinezs boots and hats lay about in corners, his coats and cassocks were hung on pegs and draped over pieces of furniture. Yet the place seemed overrun by serving-women, young and old, and by large yellow cats with full soft fur, of a special breed, apparently. They slept in the window- sills, lay on the well-curb in the patio; the boldest came, directly, to the supper-table, where their master fed them carelessly from his plate. | 144 PADRE MARTINEZ When they sat down to supper, the host introduced to the Bishop the tall, stout young man with the protruding front, who had been asleep on the floor. He said again that Trinidad Lucero was studying with him, and was supposed to be his secretary, adding that he spent most of his time hanging about the kitchen and hindering the girls at their work. These remarks were made in the young mans presence, but did not embarrass him at all. His whole attention was fixed upon the mutton stew, which he began to devour with undue haste as soon as his plate was put before him. The Bishop observed later that Trinidad was treated very much like a poor relation or a servant. He was sent on errands, was told without ceremony to fetch the Padres boots, to bring wood for the fire, to saddle his horse. Father Latour disliked his personality so much that he could scarcely look at him. His fat face was irritatingly stupid, and had the grey, oily look of soft cheeses. The corners of his mouth were deep folds in plump- ness, like the creases in a babys legs, and the steel rim of his spectacles, where it crossed his nose, was embedded in soft flesh. He said not one word during supper, but ate as if he were afraid of never seeing food again. When his attention left his plate for a moment, it was fixed in the same greedy way upon the girl who served the tableand who seemed to regard him with careless contempt. The student gave 145 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP the impression of being always stupefied by one form of sensual disturbance or another. Padre Martinez, with a napkin tied round his neck to protect his cassock, ate and drank generously. The Bishop found the food poor enough, despite the many cooks, though the wine, which came from El Paso del Norte, was very fair. During supper, his host asked the Bishop flatly if he considered celibacy an essential condition of the priests vocation. Father Latour replied merely that this question had been thrashed out many centuries ago and decided once for all. Nothing is decided once for all, Martinez de- clared fiercely. Celibacy may",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,43,"be all very well for the French clergy, but not for ours. St. Augustine him- self says it is better not to go against nature. I find every evidence that in his old age he regretted having practised continence. The Bishop said he would be interested to see the passages from which he drew such conclusions, ob- serving that he knew the writings of St. Augustine fairly well. T have the telling passages all written down some- where. I will find them before you go. You have probably read them with a sealed mind. Celibate priests lose their perceptions. No priest can experience repentance and forgiveness of sin unless he himself 146 PADRE MARTINEZ falls into sin. Since concupiscence is the most common form of temptation, it is better for him to know some- thing about it. The soul cannot be humbled by fasts and prayer; it must be broken by mortal sin to ex- perience forgiveness of sin and rise to a state of grace. Otherwise, religion is nothing but dead logic. This is a subject upon which we must confer later, and at some length, said the Bishop quietly. T shall reform these practices throughout my diocese as rapidly as possible. I hope it will be but a short time until there is not a priest left who does not keep all the vows he took when he bound himself to the service of the altar. The swarthy Padre laughed, and threw off the big cat which had mounted to his shoulder. It will keep you busy, Bishop. Nature has got the start of you here. But for all that, our native priests are more devout than your French Jesuits. We have a living Church here, not a dead arm of the European Church. Our religion grew out of the soil, and has its own roots. We pay a filial respect to the person of the Holy Father, but Rome has no authority here. We do not require aid from the Propaganda, and we resent its interference. The Church the Franciscan Fathers planted here was cut off; this is the second growth, and is indigenous. Our people are the most devout left in the world. If you blast their faith by European for- malities, they will become infidels and profligates. 147 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP To this eloquence the Bishop returned blandly that he had not come to deprive the people of their religion, but that he would be compelled to deprive some of the priests of their parishes if they did not change their way of life. Father Martinez filled his glass and replied with perfect good humour. You cannot deprive me of mine, Bishop. Try it! I will organize my own church. You can have your French priest of Taos, and I will have the people! With this the Padre left the table and stood warm- ing his back at the fire, his cassock pulled up about his waist to expose his trousers to the blaze. You are a young man, my Bishop, he went on, rolling his big head back and looking up at the well-smoked roof poles. And you know nothing about Indians or Mexicans. If you try to introduce European civili- zation here and change our old ways, to interfere with the secret dances of the Indians, let us say, or abolish the bloody rites of the Penitentes, I foretell an early death for you. I advise you to study our native tradi- tions before you begin your reforms. You are among barbarous people, my Frenchman, between two savage races. The dark things forbidden by your Church are a part of Indian religion. You cannot in- troduce French fashions here. At this moment the student, Trinidad, got up quietly, and after an obsequious bow to the Bishop, 148 PADRE MARTINEZ went with soft, escaping tread toward the kitchen. When his brown skirt had disappeared through the door, Father Latour turned sharply to his host. Martinez, I consider it very unseemly to talk in this loose fashion before young men, especially a young man who is studying for the priesthood. Furthermore, I cannot see why a young man of this calibre should be encouraged to take orders, He will never hold a parish in my diocese. too Padre Martinez laughed and showed his long, yellow teeth. Laughing did not become him; his teeth were large distinctly vulgar. Oh, Trinidad will go to Arroyo Hondo as curate to his uncle, who is growing old. Hes a very devout fellow, Trinidad. You ought to see him in Passion Week. He goes up to Abiquiu and becomes another man; carries the heaviest crosses to the highest moun- tains, and takes more scourging than anyone. He comes back here with his back so full of cactus spines",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,44,"that the girls have to pick him like a chicken. Father Latour was tired, and went to his room soon after supper. The bed, upon examination, seemed clean and comfortable, but he felt uncertain of its surroundings. He did not like the air of this house. After he retired, the clatter of dish-washing and the giggling of women across the patio kept him awake a long while; and when that ceased, Father Martinez began snoring in some chamber near by. He must 149 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP have left his door open-into the pazo, for the adobe partitions were thick enough to smother sound otherwise. The Padre snored like an enraged bull, until the Bishop decided to go forth and find his door and close it. He arose, lit his candle, and opened his own door in half-hearted resolution. As the. night wind blew into the room, a little dark shadow flut- tered from the wall across the floor; a mouse, per- haps. But no, it was a bunch of womans hair that had been indolently tossed into a corner when some slovenly female toilet was made in this room. This discovery annoyed the Bishop exceedingly. High Mass was at eleven the next morning, the parish priest officiating and the Bishop in the Epis- copal chair. He was well pleased with the church of Taos. The building was clean and in good repair, the congregation large and devout. The delicate lace, snowy linen, and burnished brass on the altar told of a devoted Altar Guild. The boys who served at the altar wore rich smocks of hand-made lace over their scarlet surplices. The Bishop had never heard the Mass more impressively sung than by Father Martinez. The man had a beautiful baritone voice, and he drew from some deep well of emotional - power. Nothing in the service was slighted, every phrase and gesture had its full value. At the moment of the Elevation the dark priest seemed to give his 150 PADRE MARTINEZ whole force, his swarthy body and all its blood, to that lifting-up. Rightly guided, the Bishop reflected, this Mexican might have been a great man. He had an altogether compelling personality, a disturb- ing, mysterious magnetic power. After the confirmation service, Father Martinez had horses brought round and took the Bishop out to see his farms and live-stock. He took him all over his ranches down in the rich bottom lands between Taos and the Indian pueblo which, as Father Latour knew, had come into his possession from the seven Indians who were hanged. Martinez referred care- lessly to the Bent massacre as they rode along. He boasted that there had never been trouble afoot in New Mexico that wasnt started in Taos. They stopped just west of the pueblo a little before sunset, a pueblo very different from all the others the Bishop had visited; two large communal houses, shaped like pyramids, gold-coloured in the afternoon light, with the purple mountain lying just behind them. Gold-coloured men in white burnouses came out on the stairlike flights of roofs, and stood still as statues, apparently watching the changing light on the mountain. There was a religious silence over the place; no sound at all but the bleating of goats coming home through clouds of golden dust. - These two houses, the Padre told him, had been continuously occupied by this tribe for more than 151 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP a thousand years. Coronados men found them there, and described them as a superior kind of Indian, handsome and dignified in bearing, dressed in deerskin coats and trousers like those of Europeans. Though the mountain was timbered, its lines were so sharp that it had the sculptured look of naked mountains like the Sandias. The general growth on its sides was evergreen, but the canyons and ravines were wooded with aspens, so that the shape of every depression was painted on the mountain-side, light green against the dark, like symbols; serpentine, crescent, half-circles. This mountain and its ravines had been the seat of old religious ceremonies, honey- combed with noiseless Indian life, the repository of Indian secrets, for many centuries, the Padre re- marked. And some place in there, you may be sure, they keep Pops estufa, but no white man will ever see it. I mean the estufa where Pop sealed himself up for four years and never saw the light of day, when he was planning the revolt of 1680. I suppose you know all about that outbreak, Bishop Latour? Something, of course, from the Martyrology. But I did not know that it originated in Taos. Havent I just told you that all the trouble there ever was in New Mexico originated in Taos? boasted the Padre. Pop was born a San Juan",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,45,"Indian, but so was Napoleon a Corsican. He operated from Taos. 152 PADRE MARTINEZ Padre Martinez knew his country, a country which had no written histories. He gave the Bishop much the best account he had heard of the great Indian revolt of 1680, which added such a long chapter to the Martyrology of the New World, when all the Spaniards were killed or driven out, and there was not one European left alive north of El Paso del Norte. That night after supper, as his host sat taking snuff, Father Latour questioned him closely and learned something about the story of his life. Martinez was born directly under that solitary blue mountain on the sky-line west of Taos, shaped like a pyramid with the apex sliced off, in Abiquiu. It was one of the oldest Mexican settlements in the territory, surrounded by canyons so deep and ranges so rugged that it was practically cut off from inter- course with the outside world. Being so solitary, its people were sombre in temperament, fierce and fanatical in religion, celebrated the Passion Week by cross-bearings and bloody scourgings. Antonio Jos Martinez grew up there, without learning to read or write, married at twenty, and lost his wife and child when he was twenty-three. After his marriage he had learned to read from the parish priest, and when he became a widower he decided to study for the priesthood. Taking his clothes and the little money he got from the sale of his household 153 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP goods, he started on horseback for Durango, in Old Mexico. There he entered the Seminary and began a life of laborious study. The Bishop could imagine what it meant for a young man who had not learned to read until long after adolescence, to undergo a severe academic train- ing. He found Martinez deeply versed, not only in the Church Fathers, but in the Latin and Spanish classics. After six years at the Seminary, Martinez had returned to his native Abiquiu as priest of the parish church there. He was passionately attached to that old village under the pyramidal mountain. All the while he had been in Taos, half a lifetime now, he made periodic pilgrimages on horseback back to Abiquiu, as if the flavour of his own yellow earth were medicine to his soul. Naturally he hated the Americans. The American occupation meant the end of men like himself. He was a man of the old order, a son of Abiquiu, and his day was over. On his departure from Taos, the Bishop went out of his way to make a call at Kit Carsons ranch house. Carson, he knew, was away buying sheep, but Father Latour wished to see the Sefiora Carson to thank her again for her kindness to poor Magdalena, and to tell her of the womans happy and devoted life with the Sisters in their school at Santa F. The Sefora received him with that quiet but un- 154 PADRE MARTINEZ abashed hospitality which is a common grace in Mexican households. She was a tall woman, slender, with drooping shoulders* and lustrous black eyes and hair. Though she could not read, both her face and conversation were intelligent. To the Bishops thinking, she was handsome; her countenance showed that discipline of life which he admired. She had a cheerful disposition, too, and a pleasant sense of humour. It was possible to talk confidentially to her. She said she hoped he had been comfortable in Padre Martinezs house, with an inflection which told that she much doubted it, and she laughed a little when he confessed that he had been annoyed by the presence of Trinidad Lucero. Some people say he is Father Luceros son, she said with a shrug. But I do not think so. More likely one of Padre Martinezs. Did you hear what happened to him at Abiquiu last year, in Passion Week? He tried to be like the Saviour, and had himself crucified. Oh, not with nails! He was tied upon a cross with ropes, to hang there all night; they do that sometimes at Abiquiu, it is a very old-fash- ioned place. But he is so heavy that after he had hung there a few hours, the cross fell over with him, and he was very much humiliated. Then he had himseif tied to a post and said he would bear as many stripes as our Saviour six thousand, as was re- vealed to St. Bridget. But before they had given him 155 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP a hundred, he fainted. They scourged him with cactus whips, and his back was so poisoned that he was sick up there for a long while. This year they sent word that they did not want",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,46,"him at Abiquiu, so he had to keep Holy Week here, and everybody laughed at him. Father Latour asked the Sefiora to tell him frankly whether she thought he could put a stop to the extravagances of the Penitential Brotherhood. She smiled and shook her head. I often say to my husband, I hope you will not try to do that. It would only set the people against you. The old people have need of their old customs; and the young ones will go with the times. As the Bishop was taking his leave, she put into his saddle-bags a beautiful piece of lace-work for Magdalena. She will not be likely to use it for her- self, but she will be glad to have it to give to the Sisters. That brutal man left her nothing. After he was hung, there was nothing to sell but his gun and one burro. That was why he was going to take the risk of killmg two Padres for their mules and for spite against religion, maybe! Magdalena said he had often threatened to kill the priest at Mora. At Santa F the Bishop found Father Vaillant awaiting him. They had not seen each other since Faster, and there were many things to be discussed. 150 PADRE MARTINEZ The vigour and zeal of Bishop Latours administra- tion had already been recognized at Rome, and he had lately received a letter from Cardinal Fransoni, Prefect of the Propaganda, announcing that the vicarate of Santa F had been formally raised to a diocese. By the same long-delayed post came an invitation from the Cardinal, urgently requesting Father Latours presence at important conferences at the Vatican during the following year. Though all these matters must be taken up in their turn between the Bishop and his Vicar-General, Father Joseph had undoubtedly come up from Albuquerque at this particular time because of a lively curiosity to hear how the Bishop had been received in Taos. Seated in the study in their old cassocks, with the candles lighted on the table between them, they spent a long evening. For the present, Father Latour remarked, I shall do nothing to change the curious situation at Taos. It is not expedient to interfere. The church is strong, the people are devout. No matter what the conduct of the priest has been, he has built up a strong organization, and his people are devotedly loyal to him. But can he be disciplined, do you think? Oh, there is no question of discipline! He has been a little potentate too long. His people would assuredly support him against a French Bishop. 157 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP For the present I shall be blind to what I do not like thercas But Jean, Father Joseph broke out in agitation, the mans life is an open scandal, one hears of it everywhere. Only a few weeks ago I was told a piti- ful story of a Mexican girl carried off in one of the Indian raids on the Costella valley. She was a child of eight when she was carried away, and was fifteen when she was found and ransomed. During all that time the pious girl had preserved her virginity by a succession of miracles. She had a medal from the shrine of Our Lady of Guadeloupe tied round her neck, and she said such prayers as she had been taught. Her chastity was threatened many times, but always some unexpected event averted the catastrophe. After she was found and sent back to some relatives living in Arroyo Hondo, she was so devout that she wished to become a religious. She was debauched by this Martinez, and he married her to one of his peons. She is now living on one of his farms. Yes, Christobal told me that story, said the Bishop with a shrug. But Padre Martinez is getting too old to play the part of Don Juan much longer. I do not wish to lose the parish of Taos in order to punish its priest, my friend. I have no priest strong enough to put in his place. You are the only man who could meet the situation there, and 158 PADRE MARTINEZ you are at Albuquerque. A year from now I shall be in Rome, and there I hope to get a Spanish mission- ary who will take over the parish of Taos. Only a Spaniard would be welcomed there, I think. Vou are doubtless right, said Father Joseph. T am often too hasty in my judgments. I may do very badly for you while you are in Europe. For I suppose I am to leave my dear Albuquerque, and come to Santa F while you are gone? Assuredly. They will love you all the more for lacking",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,47,"you awhile. I hope to bring some more hardy Auvergnats back with me, young men from our own Seminary, and I am afraid I must put one of them in Albuquerque. You have been there long enough. You have done all that is necessary. I need you here, Father Joseph. As it is now, one of us must ride seventy miles whenever we wish to converse about anything. Father Vaillant sighed. Ah, I supposed it would come! You will snatch me from Albuquerque as you did from Sandusky. When I went there everybody was my enemy, now everybody is my friend; therefore it is time to go. Father Vaillant took off his glasses, folded them, and put them in their case, which act always announced his determination to retire. So a year from now you will be in Rome. Well, I had rather be among my people in Albuquerque, that I can say honestly. But Clermont, there I envy you. 159 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP I should like to see my own mountains again. At least you will see all my family and bring me word of them, and you can bring me the vestments that my dear sister Philomne and her nuns have been making for me these three years. I shall be very glad to have them. He rose, and took up one of the candles. And when you leave Clermont, Jean, put a few chestnuts in your pocket for me! 2 THE MISER In February Bishop Latour once more set out on horseback over the Santa F trail, this time with Rome as his objective. He was absent for nearly a year, and when he returned he brought with him four young priests from his own Seminary of Mont- ferrand, and a Spanish priest, Father Taladrid, whom he had found in Rome, and who was at once sent to Taos. At the Bishops suggestion, Padre Martinez formally resigned his parish, with the understanding that he was still to celebrate Mass upon solemn occasions. Not only did he avail himself of this privilege, but he continued to perform all marriages and burial services and to dictate the lives 160 PADRE MARTINEZ of the parishioners. Very soon he and Father Tala- drid were at open war. When the Bishop, unable to compose their dif- ferences, supported the new priest, Father Martinez and his friend Father Lucero, of Arroyo Hondo, mutinied; flatly refused to submit, and organized a church of their own. This, they declared, was the old Holy Catholic Church of Mexico, while the Bishops church was an American institution. In both towns the greater part of the population went over to the schismatic church, though some pious Mexicans, in great perplexity, attended Mass at both. Father Martinez printed a long and eloquent Proc- lamation (which very few of his parishioners could read) giving an historical justification for his schism, and denying the obligation of celibacy for the priest- hood. As both he and Father Lucero were well on in years, this particular clause could be of little benefit to anyone in their new organization except Trinidad. After the two old priests went off into schism, one of their first solemn acts was to elevate Father Luceros nephew to the priesthood, and he acted as curate to them both, swinging back and forth between Taos and Arroyo Hondo. The schismatic church at least accomplished the rejuvenation of the two rebellious priests at its head, and far and wide revived mens interest in them, though they had always furnished their people with 161 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP plenty to talk about. Ever since they were young men with adjoining parishes, they had been friends, cronies, rivals, sometimes bitter enemies. But their quarrels could never keep them apart for long. Old Marino Lucero had not one trait in common with Martinez, except the love of authority. He had been a miser from his youth, and lived down in the sunken world of Arroyo Hondo in the barest poverty, though he was supposed to be very rich. He used to boast that his house was as poor as a burros stable. His bed, his crucifix, and his bean-pot were his furniture. He kept no live-stock but one poor mule, on which he rode over to Taos to quarrel with his friend Martinez, or to get a solid dinner when he was hungry. In his casa every day was Friday unless one of his neighbour women cooked a chicken and brought it in to him out of pure compassion. For his people liked him. He was grasping, but not oppressive, and he wrung more pesos out of Arroyo Seco and Questa than out of his own arroyo. Thrift is such a rare quality among Mexicans that they find it very amusing;",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,48,"his people loved to tell how he never bought anything, but picked up old brooms after housewives had thrown them away, and that he wore Padre Martinezs garments after the Padre would have them no longer, though they were so much too big for him. One of the priests fiercest quarrels had come about because Martinez gave some of his old 162 PADRE MARTINEZ clothes to a monk from Mexico who was studying at his house, and who had not wherewithal to cover himself as winter came on: The two priests had always talked shamelessly about each other. All Martinezs best stories were about Lucero, and all Luceros were about Martinez. You see how it is, Padre Lucero would say to the young men at a wedding party, my way is better than old Jos Martinezs. His nose and chin are getting to be close neighbours now, and a petti- coat is not much good to him any more. But I can still rise upright at the sight of a dollar. With a new piece of money in my hand I am happier than ever; and what can he do with a pretty girl but regret? Avarice, he assured them, was the one passion that grew stronger and sweeter in old age. He had the lust for money as Martinez had for women, and they had never been rivals in the pursuit of their pleasures. After Trinidad was ordained and went to stay with his uncle, Father Lucero complained that he had formed gross habits living with Martinez, and was eating him out of house and home. Father Martinez told with delight how Trinidad sponged upon the parish at Arroyo Hondo, and went about poking his nose into one bean-pot after another. When the Bishop could no longer remain deaf to the rebellion, he sent Father Vaillant over to Taos to publish the warning for three weeks and exhort the 163 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP two priests to renounce:their heresy. On the fourth Sunday Father Joseph, who complained that he was always sent d fouetter les chats, solemnly read the letter in which the Bishop stripped Father Martinez of the rights and privileges of the priesthood. On the afternoon of the same day, he rode over to Arroyo Hondo, eighteen miles away, and read a similar letter of excommunication against Father Lucero. Father Martinez continued at the head of his schismatic church until, after a short illness, he died and was buried in schism, by Father Lucero. Soon after this, Father Lucero himself fell into a decline. But even after he was ailing he performed a feat which became one of the legends of the country- side, killed a robber in a midnight scuffle. A wandering teamster who had been discharged from a wagon train for theft, was picking up a living over in Taos and there heard the stories about Father Luceros hidden riches. He came to Arroyo Hondo to rob the old man. Father Lucero was a light sleeper, and hearing stealthy sounds in the middle of the night, he reached for the carving-knife he kept hidden under his mattress and sprang upon the intruder. They began fighting in the dark, and though the thief was a young man and armed, the old priest stabbed him to death and then, covered with blood, ran out to arouse the town. The neighbours found the Padres chamber like a slaughter-house, his vic- 164 PADRE MARTINEZ tim lying dead beside the hole he had dug. They were amazed at what the old man had been able to do. But from the shock of that night Father Lucero never recovered. He wasted away so rapidly that his people had the horse doctor come from Taos to look at him. This veterinary was a Yankee who had been successful in treating men as well as horses, but he said he could do nothing for Father Lucero; he believed he had an internal tumour or a cancer. Padre Lucero died repentant, and Father Vaillant, who had pronounced his excommunication, was the one to reconcile him to the Church. The Vicar was in Taos on business for the Bishop, staying with Kit Carson and the Sefiora. They were all sitting at supper one evening during a heavy rain-storm, when a horseman rode up to the portale. Carson went out to receive him. The visitor he brought in with him was Trinidad Lucero, who took off his rubber coat and stood in a full-skirted cassock of Arroyo Hondo make, a crucifix about his neck, seeming to fill the room with his size and importance. After bowing ceremoniously to the Sefiora, he ad- dressed himself to Father Vaillant in his best English, speaking slowly in his thick felty voice. T am the only nephew of Padre",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,49,"Lucero. My uncle is verra seek and soon to die. She has vomit the blood. He dropped his eyes. Speak to me in your own language, man! cried 165 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Father Joseph. I can at least do more with Spanish than you can with English. Now tell me what you have to say of your uncles condition. Trinidad gave some account of his uncles illness, repeating solemnly the phrase, She has vomit the blood, which he seemed to find impressive. The sick man wished to see Father Vaillant, and begged that he would come to him and give him the Sacrament. Carson urged the Vicar to wait until morning, as the road down into the Hondo would be badly washed by rain and dangerous to go over in the dark. But Father Vaillant said if the road were bad he could go down on foot. Excusing himself to the Sefiora Carson, he went to his room to put on his riding-clothes and get his saddle-bags. Trinidad, upon invitation, sat down at the empty place and made the most of his opportunity. The host saddled Father Vaillants mule, and the Vicar rode away, with Trinidad for guide. Not that he needed a guide to Arroyo Hondo, it was a place especially dear to him, and he was always glad to find a pretext for going there. How often he had ridden over there on fine days in summer, or in early spring, before the green was out, when the whole country was pink and blue and yellow, like a coloured map. One approached over a sage-brush plain that appeared to run level and unbroken to the base of 166 PADRE MARTINEZ the distant mountains; then without warning, one suddenly found oneself upon the brink of a precipice, of a chasm in the earth over two hundred feet deep, the sides sheer cliffs, but cliffs of earth, not rock. Drawing rein at the edge, one looked down into a sunken world of green fields and gardens, with a pink adobe town, at the bottom of this great ditch. The men and mules walking about down there, or plow- ing the fields, looked like the figures of a childs Noahs ark. Down the middle of the arroyo, through the sunken fields and pastures, flowed a rushing stream which came from the high mountains. Its original source was so high, indeed, that by merely laying an open wooden trough up the opposite side of the arroyo, the Mexicans conveyed the water to the plateau at the top. This sluice was laid in sections that zigzagged up the face of the cliff. Father Vaillant always stopped to watch the water rushing up the side of the precipice like a thing alive; an ever-ascend- ing ladder of clear water, gurgling and clouding into silver as it climbed. Only once before, he used to tell the natives, in Italy, had he seen water run up hill like that. The water thus diverted was but a tiny thread of the full creek; the main stream ran down the arroyo over a white rock bottom, with green willows and deep hay grass and brilliant wild flowers on its banks. Evening primroses, the fireweed, and butterfly weed 167 t ' | DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP grew to a tropical sizeand brilliance there among the sedges. But this was the first time Father Vaillant had ever gone down into the Hondo after dark, and at the edge of the cliff he decided not to put Contento to so cruel a test. He can do it, he said to Trinidad, but I will not make him. He dismounted and went on foot down the steep winding trail. They reached Father Luceros house before mid- night. Half the population of the town seemed to be in attendance, and the place was lit up as if for a festival. The sick mans chamber was full of Mexican women, sitting about on the floor, wrapped in their black shawls, saying their prayers with lighted candles before them. One could scarcely step for the candles. Father Vaillant beckoned to a woman he knew well, Conception Gonzales, and asked her what was the meaning of this. She whispered that the dying Padre would have it so. His sight was growing dim, and he kept calling for more lights. All his life, Conception sighed, he had been so saving of candles, and had mostly done with a pine splinter in the evenings. In the corner, on the bed, Father Lucero was groan- ing and tossing, one man rubbing his feet, and another _ wringing cloths out of hot water and putting them on his stomach to dull the pain. Sefiora Gonzales 168 PADRE MARTINEZ whispered that the sick man had been gnawing the",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,50,"sheets for pain; she had brought over her best ones, and they were chewed* to lacework across the top. Father Vaillant approached the bed-side, Get away from the bed a little, my good women. Arrange yourselves along the wall, your candles blind me. But as they began rising and lifting their candle- sticks from the floor, the sick man called, No, no, do not take away the lights! Some thief will come, and I will have nothing left. The women shrugged, looked reproachfully at Father Vaillant, and sat down again. Padre Lucero was wasted to the bones. His cheeks were sunken, his hooked nose was clay-coloured and waxy, his eyes were wild with fever. They burned up at Father Joseph, great, black, glittering, distrustful eyes. On this night of his departure the old man looked more Spaniard than Mexican. He clutched Father Josephs hand with a grip sur- prisingly strong, and gave the man who was rubbing his feet a vigorous kick in the chest. Have done with my feet there, and take away these wet rags. Now that the Vicar has come, I have something to say, and I want you all to hear. Father Luceros voice had always been thin and high in pitch, his parishioners used to say it was like a horse talking. Sefior Vicario, you remember Padre 169 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Martinez? You ought to, for you served him as badly as you did me. Now listen: Father Lucero related that Martinez, before his death, had entrusted to him a certain sum of money to be spent in masses for the repose of his soul, these to be offered at his native church in Abiquiu. Lucero had not used the money as he promised, but had buried it under the dirt floor of this room, just below the large crucifix that hung on the wall yonder. At this point Father Vaillant again signalled to the women to withdraw, but as they took up their candles, Father Lucero sat up in his night-shirt and cried, Stay as you are! Are you going to run away and leave me with a stranger? I trust him no more than I do you! Oh, why did God not make some way for a man to protect his own after death? Alive, I can do it with my knife, old as I am. But after? The Sefiora Gonzales soothed Father Lucero, persuaded him to lie back upon his pillows and tell them what he wanted them to do. He explained that this money which he had taken in trust from Mar- tinez was to be sent to Abiquiu and used as the Padre had wished. Under the crucifix, and under the floor beneath the bed on which he was lying, they would find his own savings. One third of his hoard was for Trinidad. The rest was to be spent in masses for his soul, and they were to be celebrated in the old church of San Miguel in Santa F. 170 PADRE MARTINEZ Father Vaillant assured him that all his wishes should be scrupulously carried out, and now it was time for him to dismiss the cares of this world and prepare his mind to receive the Sacrament. All in good time. But a man does not let go of this world so easily. Where is Congeption Gonzales? Come here, my daughter. See to it that the money is taken up from under the floor while I am still in this chamber, before my body is cold, that it is counted in the presence of all these women, and the sum set down in writing. At this point, the old man started, as with a new hope. And Christobal, he is the man! Christobal Carson must be here to count it and set it down. He is a just man. Trinidad, you fool, why did you not bring Christobal? Father Vaillant was scandalized. Unless you compose yourself, Father Lucero, and fix your thoughts upon Heaven, I shall refuse to administer the Sacrament. In your present state of mind, it would be a sacrilege. The old man folded his hands and closed his eyes in assent. Father Vaillant went into the adjoining room to put on his cassock and stole, and in his absence Conception Gonzales covered a small table by the bed with one of her own white napkins and placed upon it two wax candles, and a cup of water for the ministrants hands. Father Vaillant came back in his vestments, with his pyx and basin of 171 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP repeating holy water, and began sprinkling the bed and the watchers, the antiphon, Asperges me, Domine, hyssopo, et mundabor. The women stole away, leaving their lights upon the floor. Father Lucero made his",no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,51,"confession, renouncing his heresy and expressing contrition, after which he received the Sacrament. The ceremony calmed the tormented man, and he lay quiet with his hands folded on his breast. The women returned and sat murmuring prayers as before. The rain drove against the window panes, the wind made a hollow sound as it sucked down through the deep arroyo. Some of the watchers were drooping from weariness, but not one showed any wish to go home. Watching beside a death-bed was not a hardship for them, but a privilege, in the case of a dying priest it was a distinction. In those days, even in European countries, death had a solemn social importance. It was not regarded as a moment when certain bodily organs ceased to function, but as a dramatic climax, a moment when the soul made its entrance into the next world, passing in full consciousness through a lowly door to an un- imaginable scene. Among the watchers there was always the hope that the dying man might reveal something of what he alone could see; that his countenance, if not his lips, would speak, and on his features would fall some light or shadow from 172 ; PADRE MARTINEZ beyond. The Last Words of great men, Napoleon, Lord Byron, were still printed in gift-books, and the dying murmurs of every common man and woman were listened for and treasured by their neighbours and kinsfolk. These sayings, no matter how unim- portant, were given oracular significance and pon- dered by those who must one day go the same road. The stillness of the death chamber was suddenly broken when Trinidad Lucero knelt down before the crucifix on the wall to pray. His uncle, though all thought him asleep, began to struggle and cry out, A thief! Help, help! Trinidad retired quickly, but after that the old man lay with one eye open, and no one dared go near the crucifix. About an hour before day-break the Padres breathing became so painful that two of the men got behind him and lifted his pillows. The women whis- pered that his face was changing, and they brought their candles nearer, kneeling close beside his bed. His eyes were alive and had perception in them. He rolled his head to one side and lay looking in- tently down into the candle-light, without blinking, while his features sharpened. Several times his lips twitched back over his teeth. The watchers held their breath, feeling sure that he would speak before he passed, and he did. After a facial spasm that was like a sardonic smile, and a clicking of breath in his mouth, their Padre spoke like a horse for the last time: 173 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Comete tu cola, Martinez, comete tu cola! (Eat your tail, Martinez, eat your tail!) Almost at once he died in a convulsion. After day-break Trinidad went forth declaring (and the Mexican women confirmed him) that at the moment of death Father Lucero had looked into the other world and beheld Padre Martinez in torment. As long as the Christians who were about that death-bed lived, the story was whispered in Arroyo Hondo. When the floor of the priests house was taken up, according to his last instructions, people came from as far as Taos and Santa Cruz and Mora to see the buckskin bags of gold and silver coin that were buried beneath it. Spanish coins, French, American, English, some of them very old. When it was at length conveyed toa Government mint and examined, it was valued at nearly twenty thousand dollars in American money. A great sum for one old priest to have scraped together in a country parish down at the bottom of a ditch. 174 BrOsOsKkKy so) bk DONA ISABELLA I DON ANTONIO ISHOP LATOUR had one very keen worldly ambition; to build in Santa F a cathedral which would be worthy of a setting naturally beau- tiful. As he cherished this wish and meditated upon it, he came to feel that such a building might be a continuation of himself and his purpose, a physical body full of his aspirations after he had passed from the scene. Early in his administration he began set- ting aside something from his meagre resources for a cathedral fund. In this he was assisted by certain of the rich Mexican rancheros, but by no one so much as by Don Antonio Olivares. Antonio Olivares was the most intelligent and prosperous member of a large family of brothers and cousins, and he was for that time and place a man of wide experience, a man of the world. He had 175 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP spent the greater part of his life in New Orleans and El Paso del Norte, but he",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,52,"returned to live in Santa F several years after Bishop Latour took up his duties there. He brought with him his American wife and a wagon train of furniture, and settled down to spend his declining years in the old ranch house just east of the town where he was born and had grown up. He was then a man of sixty. In early manhood he had lost his first wife; after he went to New Orleans he had married a second time, a Ken- tucky girl who had grown up among her relatives in Louisiana. She was pretty and accomplished, had been educated at a French convent, and had done much to Europeanize her husband. The refinement of his dress and manners, and his lavish style of living, provoked half-contemptuous envy among his brothers and their friends. Olivaress wife, Dofia Isabella, was a devout Catholic, and at their house the French priests were always welcome and were most cordially entertained. The Sefiora Olivares had made a pleasant place of the rambling adobe building, with its great court- yard and gateway, carved joists and beams, fine herring-bone ceilings and snug fire-places. She was a gracious hostess, and though no longer very young, she was still attractive to the eye; a slight woman, spirited, quick in movement, with a delicate blonde complexion which she had successfully guarded in 176 DONA ISABELLA trying climates, and fair hair a little silvered, and perhaps worn in too many puffs and ringlets for the sharpening outline of her face. She spoke French well, Spanish lamely, played the harp, and sang agreeably. Certainly it was a great piece of luck for Father Latour and Father Vaillant, who lived so much among peons and Indians and rough frontiersmen, to be able to converse in their own tongue now and then with a cultivated woman; to sit by that hospi- table fireside, in rooms enriched by old mirrors and engravings and upholstered chairs, where the win- dows had clean curtains, and the sideboard and cup- boards were stocked with plate and Belgian glass. It was refreshing to spend an evening with a couple who were interested in what was going on in the outside world, to eat a good dinner and drink good wine, and listen to music. Father Joseph, that man of mconsistencies, had a pleasing tenor voice, true though not strong. Madame Olivares liked to sing old French songs with him. She was a trifle vain, it must be owned, and when she sang at all, insisted upon singing in three languages, never forgetting her husbands favourites, La Paloma and La Golan- drina, and My Nelly Was A Lady. The negro melodies of Stephen Foster had already travelled to the frontier, going along the river highways, not in print, but passed on from one humble singer to another. 177 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Don Antonio was a large man, heavy, full at the belt, a trifle bald, and very slow of speech. But his eyes were lively, and the yellow spark in them was often most perceptible when he was quite silent. It was interesting to observe him after dinner, settled in one of his big chairs from New Orleans, a cigar between his long golden-brown fingers, watching his wife at her harp. There was gossip about the lady in Santa F, of course, since she had retained her beautiful com- plexion and her husbands devoted regard for so many years. The Americans and the Olivares brothers said she dressed much too youthfully, which was perhaps true, and that she had lovers in New Orleans and El Paso del Norte. Her nephews-in-law went so far as to declare that she was enamoured of the Mex- ican boy the Olivares had brought up from San An- tonio to play the banjo for them, they both loved music, and this boy, Pablo, was a magician with his instrument. All sorts of stories went out from the kitchen; that Dofia Isabella had a whole chamber full of dresses so grand that she never wore them here at all; that she took gold from her husbands pockets and hid it under the floor of her room; that she gave him love potions and herb-teas to increase his ardour. This gossip did not mean that her serv- ants were disloyal, but rather that they were proud of their mistress, 178 DONA ISABELLA Olivares, who read the newspapers, though they were weeks old when he got them, who liked cigars better than cigarettes, and French wine better than whisky, had little in common with his younger brothers. Next to his old friend Manuel Chavez, the two French priests were the men in Santa F whose company he most enjoyed, and he let them see it. He was a man who cherished",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,53,"his friends. He liked to call at the Bishops house to advise him about the care of his young orchard, or to leave a bottle of home-made cherry brandy for Father Joseph. It was Olivares who presented Father Latour with the silver hand-basin and pitcher and toilet accessories which gave him so much satisfaction all the rest of his life. There were good silversmiths among the Mexicans of Santa F, and Don Antonio had his own toilet-set copied in hammered silver for his friend. Doma Isabella once remarked that her husband always gave Father Vaillant something good for the palate, and Father Latour something good for the eye. | This couple had one child, a daughter, the Sefiorita Inez, born long ago and still unmarried. Indeed, it was generally understood that she would never marry. Though she had not taken the veil, her life was that of a nun. She was very plain and had none of her mothers social graces, but she had a beau- tiful contralto voice. She sang in the Cathedral 179 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP choir in New Orleans, and taught singing in a con- vent there. She came to visit her parents only once after they settled in Santa F, and she was a somewhat sombre figure in that convivial household. Dona Isabella seemed devotedly attached to her, but afraid of displeasing her. While Inez was there, her mother dressed very plainly, pinned back the little curls that hung over her right ear, and the two women went to church together all day long. Antonio Olivares was deeply interested in the Bishops dream of a cathedral. For one thing, he saw that Father Latour had set his heart on building one, and Olivares was the sort of man who liked to help a friend accomplish the desire of his heart. Furthermore, he had a deep affection for his native town, he had travelled and seen fine churches, and he wished there might some day be one in Santa F. Many a night he and Father Latour talked of it by the fire; discussed the site, the design, the building stone, the cost and the grave difficulties of raising money. It was the Bishops hope to begin work upon the building in 1860, ten years after his appointment to the Bishopric. One night, at a long- remembered New Years party in his house, Olivares announced in the presence of his guests that before the new year was gone he meant to give to the Cathedral fund a sum sufficient to enable Father Latour to carry out his purpose. 180 DONA ISABELLA That supper party at the Olivares was memorable because of this pledge, and because it marked a parting of old friends. Dona Isabella was enter- taining the officers at the Post, two of whom had received orders to leave Santa F. The popular Commandant was called back to Washington, the Irish Catholic, young lieutenant of cavalry, an lately married and very dear to Father Latour, was to be sent farther west. (Before the next New Years Day came round he was killed in Indian warfare on the plains of Arizona.) But that night the future troubled nobody; the house was full of light and music, the air warm with that simple hospitality of the frontier, where people dwell in exile, far from their kindred, where they lead rough lives and seldom meet together for plea- sure. Kit Carson, who greatly admired Madame Olivares, had come the two days journey from Taos to be present that night, and brought along his gentle half-breed daughter, lately home from a convent school in St. Louis. On this occasion he wore a handsome buckskin coat, embroidered in silver, with brown velvet cuffs and collar. The officers from the Fort were in dress uniform, the host as usual wore a broadcloth frock-coat. His wife was in a hoop-skirt, a French dress from New Orleans, all covered with little garlands of pink satin roses. The military ladies came out to the Olivares place 181 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in an army wagon, to keep their satin shoes from the mud. The Bishop had put on his violet vest, which he seldom wore, and Father Vaillant had donned a fresh new cassock, made by the loving hands of his sister Philomne, in Riom. Father Latour had used to feel a little ashamed that Joseph kept his sister and her nuns so busy making cassocks and vestments for him; but the last time he was in France he came to see all this in another light. When he was visiting Mother Philo- mnes convent, one of the younger Sisters had confided to him what an inspiration it was to them, living in retirement, to work for the far-away mis- sions. She",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,54,"told him also how precious to them were Father Vaillants long letters, letters in which he told his sister of the country, the Indians, the pious Mexican women, the Spanish martyrs of old. These letters, she said, Mother Philomne read aloud in the evening. The nun took Father Latour to a window that jutted out and looked up the narrow street to where the wall turned at an angle, cutting off further view. Look, she said, after the Mother has read us one of those letters from her brother, IT come and stand in this alcove and look up our little ' street with its one lamp, and just beyond the turn there, is New Mexico; all that he has written us of those red deserts and blue mountains, the great plains and the herds of bison, and the canyons more pro- 182 DONA ISABELLA found than our deepest mountain gorges. I can feel that I am there, my heart beats faster, and it seems but a moment until the retiring-bell cuts short my dreams. The Bishop went away believing that it was good for these Sisters to work for Father Joseph. on the sheen of To-night, when Madame Olivares was compli- menting Father Vaillant his poplin and velvet, for some reason Father Latour recalled that moment with the nun in her alcove window, her white face, her burning eyes, and sighed. After supper was over and the toasts had been drunk, the boy Pablo was called in to play for the company while the gentlemen smoked. The banjo always remained a foreign instrument to Father Latour; he found it more than a little savage. When this strange yellow boy played it, there was softness and languor in the wire strings but there was also a kind of madness; the recklessness, the call of wild countries which all these men had felt and followed in one way or another. Through clouds of cigar smoke, the scout and the soldiers, the Mexican rancheros and the priests, sat silently watching the bent head and crouching shoulders of the banjo player, and his seesawing yellow hand, which sometimes lost all form and became a mere whirl of matter in motion, like a patch of sand-storm. Observing them thus in repose, in the act of re- 183 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP flection, Father Latour was thinking how each of these men not only had a story, but seemed to have become his story. Those anxious, far-seeing blue eyes of Carsons, to whom could they belong but to a scout and trail-breaker? Don Manuel Chavez, the handsomest man of the company, very elegant in velvet and broadcloth, with delicately cut, dis- dainful features, one had only to see him cross the room, or to sit next him at dinner, to feel the electric quality under his cold reserve; the fierceness of some embitterment, the passion for danger. Chavez boasted his descent from two Castilian knights who freed the city of Chavez from the Moors in 1160. He had estates in the Pecos and in the San Mateo mountains, and a house in Santa F, where he hid himself behind his beautiful trees and gardens. He loved the natural beauties of his country with a passion, and he hated the Americans who were blind to them. He was jealous of Carsons fame as an Indian-fighter, declaring that he had seen more Indian warfare before he was twenty than ~ Carson would ever see. He was easily Carsons rival as a pistol shot. With the bow and arrow he had no rival; he had never been beaten. No Indian had ever been known to shoot an arrow as far as Chavez. Every year parties of Indians came up to the Villa to shoot with him for wagers. His house and stables were full of trophies. He took a cool pleasure in 184 DONA ISABELLA stripping the Indians of their horses or silver or blankets, or whatever they had put up on their man. He was proud of his skill with Indian weapons; he had acquired it in a hard school. When he was a lad of sixteen Manuel Chavez had gone out with a party of Mexican youths to hunt Navajos. In those days, before the American occu- pation, hunting Navajos needed no pretext, it was a form of sport. A company of Mexicans would ride west to the Navajo country, raid a few sheep camps, and come home bringing flocks and ponies and a bunch of prisoners, for every one of whom they received a large bounty from the Mexican Govern- ment. It was with such a raiding party that the boy Chavez went out for spoil and adventure. Finding no Indians abroad, the young Mexicans pushed on farther than they had intended. They did",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes

They were immediately impossible. They surrounded, fought on the naked sandstone ledges that overhang that gulf. Don Jos Chavez, Manuels older brother, was captain of the party, and was one of the first to fall. The company of fifty were slaughtered to a man. 185 and retreat was DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Manuel was the fifty-first, and he survived. With seven arrow wounds, and one shaft clear through his body, he was left for dead in a pile of corpses. That night, while the Navajos were celebrating their victory, the boy crawled along the rocks until he had high boulders between him and the enemy, and then started eastward on foot. It was summer, and the heat of that red sandstone country is intense. His -wounds were on fire. But he had the superb vitality of early youth. He walked for two days and nights with- out finding a drop of water, covering a distance of sixty odd miles, across the plain, across the mountain, until he came to the famous spring on the other side, where Fort Defiance was afterward built. There he drank and bathed his wounds and slept. He had had no food since the morning before the fight; near the spring he found some large cactus plants, and slicing away the spines with his hunting-knife, he filled his stomach with the juicy pulp. From here, still without meeting a human creature, the stumbled on until he reached the San Mateo mountain, north of Laguna. In a mountain valley he came upon a camp of Mexican shepherds, and fell unconscious. The shepherds. made a litter of saplings and their sheepskin coats and carried him into the village of Cebolleta, where he lay delirious for many days. Years afterward, when Chavez came into his inheritance, he bought that beautiful val- 186 DONA ISABELLA ley in the San Mateo mountain where he had sunk unconscious under two noble oak trees. He built a house between those twin oaks, and made a fine estate there. Never reconciled to American rule, Chavez lived in seclusion when he was in Santa F. At the first rumour of an Indian outbreak, near or far, he rode off to add a few more scalps to his record. He distrusted the new Bishop because of his friend- liness toward Indians and Yankees. Besides, Chavez was a Martinez man. He had come here to-night only in compliment to Sefiora Olivares; he hated to spend an evening among American uniforms. When the banjo player was exhausted, Father Joseph said that as for him, he would like a little drawing-room music, and he led Madame Olivares to her harp. She was very charming at her instru- ment; the pose suited her tip-tilted canary head, and her little foot and white arms. This was the last time the Bishop heard her sing Ta Paloma for her admiring husband, whose eyes smiled at her even when his heavy face seemed asleep. Olivares died on Septuagesima Sunday fell over by his own fire-place when he was lighting the candles after supper, and the banjo boy was sent running for the Bishop. Before midnight two of 187 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP the Olivares brothers, half drunk with brandy and excitement, galloped out of Santa F, on the road to Albuquerque, to employ an American lawyer. 2 THE LADY Axromto OLIVARESS funeral was the most solemn and magnificent ever seen in Santa F, but Father Vaillant was not there. He was off on a long mission- ary journey to the south, and did not reach home until Madame Olivares had been a widow for some weeks. He had scarcely got off his riding-boots when he was called into Father Latours study to see her lawyer. Olivares had entrusted the management of his affairs to a young Irish Catholic, Boyd OReilly, who had come out from Boston to practise law in the new Territory. There were no steel safes in Santa F at that time, but OReilly had kept Oli- varess will in his strong-box. The document was brief and clear: Antonios estate amounted to about two hundred thousand dollars in American money (a considerable fortune in those days). The income 188 DONA ISABELLA therefrom was to be enjoyed by my wife, Isabella Olivares, and her daughter, Inez Olivares, during their lives, and after their decease his property was to go to the Church, to the Society for the Propaga- tion of the Faith. The codicil, in favour of the Cathedral fund, had, unfortunately, never been",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,56,"added to the will. The young lawyer explained to Father Vaillant that the Olivares brothers had retained the leading legal firm of Albuquerque and were contesting the will. Their point of attack was that Sefiorita Inez was too old to be the daughter of the Sefiora Olivares. Don Antonio had been a promiscuous lover in his young days, and his brothers held that Inez was the ofispring of some temporary attachment, and had been adopted by Dofia Isabella. OReilly had sent to New Orleans for an attested copy of the marriage record of the Olivares couple, and the birth certificate of Sefiorita Inez. But in Kentucky, where the Sefiora was born, no birth records were kept; there was no document to prove the age of Isabella Olivares, and she could not be persuaded to admit her true age. It was generally believed in Santa F that she was still in her early forties, in which case she would not have been more than six or eight years old at the date when Inez was born. In reality the lady was past fifty, but when OReilly had tried to per- suade her to admit this in court, she simply refused 189 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP to listen to him. He begged the Bishop and the Vicar to use their influence with her to this end. Father Latour shrank from interfering in so deli- cate a matter, but Father Vaillant saw at once that it was their plain duty to protect the two women and, at the same time, secure the rights of the Propaganda. Without more ado he threw on his old cloak over his cassock, and the three men set off through the red mud to the Olivares hacienda in the hills east of the town. Father Joseph had not been to the Olivares house since the night of the New Years party, and he sighed as he approached the place, already trans- formed by neglect. The big gate was propped open by a pole because the iron hook was gone, the court- yard was littered with rags and meat bones which the dogs had carried there and no one had taken away. The big parrot cage, hanging in the portale, was filthy, and the birds were squalling. When OReilly rang the bell at the outer gate, Pablo, the banjo player, came running out with tousled hair and a dirty shirt to admit the visitors. He took them into the long living-room, which was empty and cold, the fire-place dark, the hearth unswept. Chairs and window-sills were deep in red dust, the glass panes dirty, and streaked as if by tear-drops. On the writing- table were empty bottles and sticky glasses and cigar ends. In one corner stood the harp in its green cover. 190 DONA ISABELLA Pablo asked the Fathers to be seated. His mis- tress was staying in bed, he said, and the cook had burnt her hand, and the other maids were lazy. He brought wood and laid a fire. After some time, Dofa Isabella entered, dressed in heavy mourning, her face very white against the black, and her eyes red. The curls about her neck and ears were pale, too quite ashen. After Father Vaillant had greeted her and spoken consoling words, the young lawyer began once more gently to explain to her the difficulties that con- fronted them, and what they must do to defeat the action of the Olivares family. She sat submissively, touching her eyes and nose with her little lace hand- kerchief, and clearly not even trying to understand a word of what he said to her. Father Joseph soon lost patience and himself approached the widow. You understand, my child, he began briskly, that your husbands_ brothers are determined to disregard his wishes, to defraud you and your daughter, and, eventually, the Church. This is no time for childish vanity. To prevent this outrage to your husbands memory, you must satisfy the court that you are old enough to be the mother of Mademoiselle Inez. You must resolutely declare your true age; fifty-three, is it not? Dofta Isabella became pallid with fright. She shrank into one end of the deep sofa, but her 191 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP blue eyes focused and gathered light, as she became intensely, rigidly animated in her corner, her back against the wall, as it were. Fifty-three!? she cried in a voice of horrified amazement. Why, I never heard of anything so outrageous! I was forty-two my last birthday. It was in December, the fourth of December. If An- tonio were here, he would tell you! And he wouldnt let you scold me and talk about business to me, either, Father Joseph. He never let anybody talk about business to me! She hid her",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,57,"face in her little handkerchief and began to cry. Father Latour checked his impetuous Vicar, and sat down on the sofa beside Madame Olivares, feeling very sorry for her and speaking very gently. Forty- two to your friends, dear Madame Olivares, and to the world. In heart and face you are younger than that. But to the Law and the Church there must be a literal reckoning. A formal statement in court will not make you any older to your friends; it will not add one line to your face. A woman, you know, is as old as she looks. Thats very sweet of you to say, Bishop Latour, the lady quavered, looking up at him with tear- bright eyes. But I never could hold up my head again. Let the Olivares have that old money. I dont want it. Father Vaillant sprang up and glared down at her 192 DONA ISABELLA as if he could put common sense into her drooping head by the mere intensity of his gaze. Four hun- dred thousand pesos, Sefora Isabella! he cried. Ease and comfort for you and your daughter all the rest of your lives. Would you make your daughter a beggar? The Olivares will take everything. T cant help it about Inez, she pleaded. Inez means to go into the convent anyway. And I dont care about the money. Ah, mon pre, je voudrais mieux tre jeune et mendiante, que ntre que vieille et riche, certes, our! Father Joseph caught her icy cold hand. And have you a right to defraud the Church of what is left to it in your trust? Have you thought of the consequences to yourself of such a betrayal? Father Latour glanced sternly at his Vicar. Assez, he said quietly. He took the little hand Father Joseph had released and bent over it, kissing it respectfully. We must not press this any further. We must leave this to Madame Olivares and her own conscience. I believe, my daughter, you will come to realize that this sacrifice of your vanity would be for your souls peace. Looking merely at the temporal aspect of the case, you would find poverty hard to bear. You would have to live upon the Olivaress charity, would you not? I do not wish to see this come about. I have a selfish interest; I wish you to be always your charming self and to make a 193 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP little posie in life for us here. We have not much of that. Madame Olivares stopped crying. She raised her head and sat drying her eyes. Suddenly she took hold of one of the buttons on the Bishops cassock and be- gan twisting it with nervous fingers. Father, she said timidly, what is the youngest I could possibly be, to be Inezs mother? The Bishop could not pronounce the verdict; he hesitated, flushed, then passed it on to OReilly with an open gesture of his fine white hand. Fifty-two, Sefiora Olivares, said the young man respectfully. If I can get you to admit that, and stick to it, I feel sure we will win our case. Very well, Mr. OReilly. She bowed her head. As her visitors rose, she sat looking down at the dust- covered rugs. Before everybody! she murmured, as if to herself. When they were tramping home, Father Joseph said that as for him, he would rather combat the superstitions of a whole Indian pueblo than the vanity of one white woman. And I would rather do almost anything than go through such a scene again, said the Bishop with a frown. I dont think I ever assisted at anything so cruel. Boyd OReilly defeated the Olivares brothers and 194 DONA ISABELLA won his case. The Bishop would not go to the court hearing, but Father Vaillant was there, standing in the malodorous crowd (there were no chairs in the court room), and his knees shook under him when the young lawyer, with the fierceness born of fright, poked his finger at his client and said: Sefiora Olivares, you are fifty-two years of age, are you not? Madame Olivares was swathed in mourning, her face a streak of shadowed white between folds of black veil. Ves, sir. The crape barely let it through. The night after the verdict was pronounced, Man- uel Chavez, with several of Antonios old friends, called upon the widow to congratulate her. Word of their intention had gone about the town and put others in the mood to call at a house that had been closed to visitors for so long. A considerable com- pany gathered there that evening, including some of the military people, and several hereditary en- emies of the Olivares brothers. The cook, stimulated by the sight of the long",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,58,"sala full of people once more, hastily improvised a supper. Pablo put on a white shirt and a velvet jacket, and began to carry up from the cellar his late masters best whisky and sherry, and quarts of champagne. (The Mexicans are very fond of sparkling wines. Only a few years before this, an American trader who had got into 195 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP serious political trouble with the Mexican military authorities in Santa F, regained their confidence and friendship by presenting them with a large wagon shipment of champagne three thousand, three hundred and ninety-two bottles, indeed!) This hospitable mood came upon the house sud- denly, nothing had been prepared beforehand. The wineglasses were full of dust, but Pablo wiped them out with the shirt he had just taken off, and without instructions from anyone he began gliding about with a tray full of glasses, which he afterward refilled many times, taking his station at the side-board. Even Dofia Isabella drank a little champagne; when she had sipped one glass with the young Georgia captain, she could not refuse to take another with their nearest neighbour, Ferdinand Sanchez, always a true friend to her husband. Everyone was gay, the servants and the guests, everything sparkled like a garden after a shower. Father Latour and Father Vaillant, having heard nothing of this spontaneous gathering of friends, set off at eight oclock to make a call upon the brave widow. When they entered the courtyard, they were astonished to hear music within, and to see light streaming from the long row of windows behind the portale. Without stopping to knock, they opened the door into the sala. Many candles were burning. Sefiors were standing about in long frock-coats 196 DONA ISABELLA buttoned over full figures. OReilly and a group of officers from the Fort surrounded the sideboard, where Pablo, with a white napkin wrapped showily about his wrist, was pouring champagne. From the other end of the room sounded the high tinkle of the harp, and Dona Isabellas voice: Listen to the mocking-bird, Listen to the mocking-bird! The priests waited in the doorway until the song was finished, then went forward to pay their respects to the hostess. She was wearing the unrelieved white that grief permitted, and the yellow curls were bobbing as of old three behind her right ear, one over either temple, and a little row across the back of her neck. As she saw the two black figures ap- proaching, she dropped her arms from the harp, took her satin toe from the pedal, and rose, holding out a hand to each. Her eyes were bright, and her face beamed with affection for her spiritual fathers. But her greeting was a playful reproach, uttered loud enough to be heard above the murmur of conversing groups: T never shall forgive you, Father Joseph, nor you either, Bishop Latour, for that awful lie you made me tell in court about my age! The two churchmen bowed amid laughter and applause. 107 BOOK SEVEN THE GREAT DIOCESE x THE MONTH OF MARY HE Bishops work was sometimes assisted, often impeded, by external events. By the Gadsden Purchase, executed three years after Father Latour came to Santa F, the United States took over from Mexico a great territory which now forms southern New Mexico and Arizona. The authorities at Rome notified Father Latour that this new territory was to be annexed to his diocese, but that as the national boundary lines often cut par- ishes in two, the boundaries of Church jurisdiction must be settled by conference with the Mexican Bish- ops of Chihuahua and Sonora. Such conferences would necessitate a journey of nearly four thousand miles. As Father Vaillant remarked, at Rome they did not seem to realize that it was no easy matter for two missionaries on horseback to keep up with the march of history. 198 THE GREAT DIOCESE The question hung fire for some years, the subject of voluminous correspondence. At last, in 1858, Father Vaillant was sent to arrange the debated boundaries with the Mexican Bishops. He started in the autumn and spent the whole winter on the road, going from E] Paso del Norte west to Tucson, on to Santa Magdalena and Guaymas, a seaport town on the Gulf of California, and did some sea- faring on the Pacific before he turned homeward. On his return trip he was stricken with malarial fever, resulting from exposure and bad water, and lay seriously ill in a cactus desert in Arizona. Word of his illness came to Santa F by an Indian runner, and Father Latour and Jacinto rode across New Mexico and half of Arizona, found Father Vaillant, and brought him back by easy stages. He was ill in the Bishops house for two",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,59,"months. This was the first spring that he and Father Latour had both been there at the same time, to enjoy the garden they had laid out soon after they first came to Santa F. It was the month of Mary and the month of May. Father Vaillant was lying on an army cot, covered with blankets, under the grape arbour in the garden, watching the Bishop and his gardener at work in the vegetable plots. The apple trees were in blossom, the cherry blooms had gone by. The air 199 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP and the earth interpenetrated in the warm gusts of spring; the soil was full of sunlight, and the sunlight full of red dust. The air one breathed was saturated with earthy smells, and the grass under foot had a reflection of blue sky in it. This garden had been laid out six years ago, when the Bishop brought his fruit trees (then dry switches) up from St. Louis in wagons, along with the blessed Sisters of Loretto, who came to found the Academy of Our Lady of Light. The school was now well es- tablished, reckoned a benefit to the community by Protestants as well as Catholics, and the trees were bearing. Cuttings from them were already yielding fruit in many Mexican gardens. While the Bishop was away on that first trip to Baltimore, Father Joseph had, in addition to his many official duties, found time to instruct their Mexican housekeeper, Fructosa, in cookery. Later Bishop Latour took in hand Fructosas husband, Tranquilino, and trained him as a gardener. They had boldly planned for the future; the ground behind the church, between the Bishops house and the Academy, they laid out as a spacious orchard and kitchen-garden. Ever since then the Bishop had worked on it, planting and pruning. It was his only recreation. A line of young poplars linked the Episcopal courtyard with the school. On the south, against the earth wall, was the one row of trees they had found 200 THE GREAT DIOCESE growing there when they first came, old, old tam- arisks, with twisted trunks. They had been so neglected, left to fight for life in such hard, sun- baked, burro-trodden ground, that their trunks had the hardness of cypress. They looked, indeed, like very old posts, well seasoned and polished by time, miraculously endowed with the power to burst into delicate foliage and flowers, to cover themselves with long brooms of lavender-pink blossom. Father Joseph had come to love the tamarisk above all trees. It had been the companion of his wanderings. All along his way through the deserts of New Mexico and Arizona, wherever he had come upon a Mexican homestead, out of the sun-baked earth, against the sun-baked adobe walls, the tamarisk waved its feathery plumes of bluish green. The family burro was tied to its trunk, the chickens scratched under it, the dogs slept in its shade, the washing was hung on its branches. Father Latour had often remarked that this tree seemed especially designed in shape and colour for the adobe village. The sprays of bloom which adorn it are merely another shade of the red earth walls, and its fibrous trunk is full of gold and lavender tints. Father Joseph respected the Bishops eye for such things, but himself he loved it merely because it was the tree of the people, and was like one of the family in every Mexican house- hold. . 201 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP This was a very happy season for Father Vaillant. For years he had not been able properly to observe this month which in his boyhood he had selected to be the holy month of the year for him, dedicated to the contemplation of his Gracious Patroness. In his former missionary life, on the Great Lakes, he used always to go into retreat at this season. But here there was no time for such things. Last year, in May, he had been on his way to the Hopi Indians, riding thirty miles a day; marrying, baptizing, confessing as he went, making camp in the sand-hills at night. His devotions had been constantly interrupted by practical considerations. But this year, because of his illness, the month of Mary he had been able to give to Mary; to Her he had consecrated his waking hours. At night he sank to sleep with the sense of Her protection. In the morning when he awoke, before he had opened his eyes, he was conscious of a special sweetness in the air, Mary, and the month of May. Alma Mater redemptoris! Once more he had been able to worship with the ardour of a young religious, for whom religion is pure personal devotion, unalloyed by expediency and the benumbing cares",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,60,"of a mission- arys work. Once again this had been his month; his Patroness had given it to him, the season that had always meant so much in his religious life. He smiled to remember a time long ago, when he 202 THE GREAT DIOCESE was a young curate in Cendre, in the Puy-de-Dm; how he had planned a season of special devotion to the Blessed Virgin for May, and how the old priest to whom he was assistant had blasted his hopes by cold disapproval. The old man had come through the Terror, had been trained in the aus- terity of those days of the persecution of the clergy, and he was not untouched by Jansenism. Young Father Joseph bore his rebuke with meekness, and went sadly to his own chamber. There he took his rosary and spent the entire day in prayer. Not according to my desires, but if it is for thy glory, grant me this boon, O Mary, my hope. In the evening of that same day the old pastor sent for him, and un- solicited granted him the request he had so sternly denied in the morning. How joyfully Father Joseph had written all this to his sister Philomne, then a pupil with the nuns of the Visitation in their native Riom, begging her to make him a quantity of arti- ficial flowers for his*May altar. How richly she had responded! and she rejoiced no less than he that his May devotions were so largely attended, espe- cially by the young people of the parish, in whom a notable increase of piety was manifest. Father Vaillants had been a close-knit family losing their mother while they were yet children had brought the brothers and sisters the closer together and with this sister, Philomne, he had shared 203 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP all his hopes and desires and his deepest religious life. Ever since then, all the most important events in his own history had occurred in the blessed month when this sinful and sullied world puts on white as if to commemorate the Annunciation, and becomes, for a little, lovely enough to be in truth the Bride of Christ. It was in May that he had been given grace to perform the hardest act of his life; to leave his country, to part from his dear sister and his father (under what sad circumstances!), and to start for the New World to take up a missionarys labours. That parting was not a parting, but an escape a running away, a betrayal of family trust for the sake of a higher trust. He could smile at it now, but at the time it had been terrible enough. The Bishop, thinning carrots yonder, would re- member. It was because of what Father Latour had been to him in that hour, indeed, that Father Joseph was here in a garden in Santa F. He would never have left his dear Sandusky when the newly ap- pointed Bishop asked him to share his hardships, had he not said to himself: Ah, now it is he who is torn by perplexity! I will be to him now what he was to me that day when we stood by the road-side, waiting for the diligence to Paris, and my purpose broke, and he saved me. That time came back upon Father Vaillant now 204 THE GREAT DIOCESE so keenly that he wiped a little moisture from his eyes, (he was quickly moved, after the way of sick people) and he cleared his glasses and called: Father Latour, it is time for you to rest your back. You have been stooping over a great while. The Bishop came and sat down in a wheelbarrow that stood at the edge of the arbour. T have been thinking that I shall no longer pray for your speedy recovery, Joseph. The only way I can keep my Vicar within call is to have him sick. Father Joseph smiled. You are not in Santa F a great deal yourself, my Bishop. Well, I shall be here this summer, and I hope to keep you with me. This year I want you to see my lotus flowers. Tranquilino will let the water into my lake this afternoon. The lake was a little pond in the middle of the garden, into which Tran- quilino, clever with water, like all Mexicans, had piped a stream from the Santa F creek flowing near at hand. Last summer, while you were away, the Bishop continued, we had more than a hundred lotus blossoms floating on that little lake. And all from five bulbs that I put into my valise in Rome. When do they blossom? They begin in June, but they are at their best in July. 205 DEATH COMES",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,61,"FOR THE ARCHBISHOP For with Then you must hurry them up a little. my Bishops permission, I shall be gone in July. So soon? And why? Father Vaillant moved uneasily under his blankets. To hunt for lost Catholics, Jean! Utterly lost Catholics, down in your new territory, towards Tucson. There are hundreds of poor families down there who have never seen a priest. I want to go from house to house this time, to every little settle- ment. They are full of devotion and faith, and it has nothing to feed upon but the most mistaken super- stitions. They remember their prayers all wrong. They cannot read, and since there is no one to in- struct them, how can they get right? They are like seeds, full of germination but with no moisture. A mere contact is enough to make them a living part of the Church. The more I work with the Mexicans, the more I believe it was people like them our Saviour bore in mind when He said, Unless ye become as litle children. He was thinking of people who are not clever in the things of this world, whose minds are not upon gain and worldly advancement. These poor Christians are not thrifty like our country people at home; they have no _ ven- eration for property, no sense of material values. I stop a few hours in a village, I administer the sacraments and hear confessions, I leave in every house some little token, a rosary or a religious 206 THE GREAT DIOCESE picture, and I go away feeling that I have con- ferred immeasurable happiness, and have released faithful souls that were shut away from God by neglect. Down near Tucson a Pima Indian convert once _ asked me to go off into the desert with him, as he had something to show me. He took me into a place so wild that a man less accustomed to these things might have mistrusted and feared for his life. We descended into a terrifying canyon of black rock, and there in the depths of a cave, he showed me a golden chalice, vestments and cruets, all the paraphernalia for celebrating Mass. His an- cestors had hidden these sacred objects there when the mission was sacked by Apaches, he did not know how many generations ago. The secret had been handed down in his family, and I was the first priest who had ever come to restore to God his own. To me, that is the situation in a parable. The Faith, in that wild frontier, is like a buried treasure; they guard it, but they do not know how to use it to their souls salvation. A word, a prayer, a service, is all that is needed to set free those souls in bondage. I confess I am covetous of that mission. I desire to be the man who restores these lost children to God. It will be the greatest happiness of my life. The Bishop did not reply at once to this appeal. At last he said gravely, You must realize that I 207 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP have need of you here, Father Joseph. My duties are too many for one man. But you do not need me so much as they do! Father Joseph threw off his coverings and sat up in his cassock, putting his feet to the ground. Any one of our good French priests from Montferrand can serve you here. It is work that can be done by in- telligence. But down there it is work for the heart, for a particular sympathy, and none of our new priests understand those poor natures as I do. I have almost become a Mexican! I have learned to like chili colorado and mutton fat. Their foolish ways no longer offend me, their very faults are dear to me. I am their man! Ah, no doubt, no doubt! But I must insist upon your lying down for the present. Father Vaillant, flushed and excited, dropped back upon his pillows, and the Bishop took a short turn through the garden, to the row of tamarisk trees and back. He walked slowly, with even, un- hesitating pace, with that slender, unrigid erect- ness, and the fine carriage of head, which always made him seem master of the situation. No one would have guessed that a sharp struggle was going on within him. Father Josephs impassioned request had spoiled a cherished plan, and brought Father Latour a bitter personal disappointment. There was but one thing to do,and before he reached 208 THE GREAT DIOCESE the tamarisks he had done it. He broke off a spray of the dry lilac-coloured flowers to punctuate and seal, as it were, his renunciation. He returned with the same",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,62,"easy, deliberate tread, and stood smiling beside the army cot. Your feeling must be your guide in this matter, Joseph. I shall put no obstacles in your way. A certain care for your health I must insist upon, but when you are quite well, you must follow the duty that calls loudest. They were both silent for a few moments. Father Joseph closed his eyes against the sunlight, and Father Latour stood lost in thought, drawing the plume of tamarisk blossom absently through his delicate, rather nervous fingers. His hands had a curious authority, but not the calmness so often seen in the hands of priests; they seemed always to be investigating and making firm decisions. The two friends were roused from their reflections by a frantic beating of wings. A bright flock of pigeons swept over their heads to the far end of the garden, where a woman was just emerging from the gate that led into the school grounds; Magdalena, who came every day to feed the doves and to gather flowers. The Sisters had given her charge of the altar decoration of the school chapel for this month, and she came for the Bishops apple blossoms and daffodils. She advanced in a whirlwind of gleaming 209 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP wings, and Tranquilino dropped his spade and stood watching her. At one moment the whole flock of doves caught the light in such a way that they all became invisible at once, dissolved in light and disappeared as salt dissolves in water. The next moment they flashed around, black and silver against the sun. They settled upon Magdalenas arms and shoulders, ate from her hand. When she put a crust of bread between her lips, two doves hung in the air before her face, stirring their wings and pecking at the morsel. A handsome woman she had grown to be, with her comely figure and the deep claret colour under the golden brown of her cheeks. Who would think, to look at her now, that we took her from a place where every vileness of cruelty and lust was practised! murmured Father Vaillant. Not since the days of early Christianity has the Church been able to do what it can here. She is but twenty-seven or -eight years old. I wonder whether she ought not to marry again, said the Bishop thoughtfully. Though she seems so contented, I have sometimes surprised a tragic shadow in her eyes. Do you remember the terrible look in her eyes when we first saw her? Can I ever forget it! But her very body has changed. She was then a shapeless, cringing creature. I thought her half-witted. No, no! She has had enough of the storms of this world. Here she is safe 210 THE GREAT DIOCESE and happy. Father Vaillant sat up and called to her. Magdalena, Magdalena, my child, come here and talk to us for a little. Two men grow lonely when they see nobody but each other. 2 DECEMBER NIGHT F ATHER VAILLANT had been absent in Arizona since midsummer, and it was now December. Bishop Latour had been going through one of those periods of coldness and doubt which, from his boy- hood, had occasionally settled down upon his spirit and made him feel an alien, wherever he was. He attended to his correspondence, went on his rounds among the parish priests, held services at missions the that were without building of the addition to the Sisters school: but his heart was not in these things. pastors, superintended One night about three weeks before Christmas he was lying in his bed, unable to sleep, with the sense of failure clutching at his heart. His prayers were empty words and brought him no refreshment. His soul had become a barren field. He had nothing 211 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP within himself to give his priests or his people. His work seemed superficial, a house built upon the sands. His great diocese was still a heathen country. The Indians travelled their old road of fear and darkness, battling with evil omens and ancient shadows. The Mexicans were children who played with their religion. As the night wore on, the bed on which the Bishop lay became a bed of thorns; he could bear it no longer. Getting up in the dark, he looked out of the window and was surprised to find that it was snowing, that the ground was already lightly covered. The full moon, hidden by veils of cloud, threw a pale phosphorescent luminousness over the heavens, and the towers of the church stood up black against this silvery fleece. Father Latour felt a longing to go into the church to pray; but instead he lay down again under his blankets. Then, realizing that",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,63,"it was the cold of the church he shrank from, and de- spising himself, he rose again, dressed quickly, and went out into the court, throwing on over his cassock that faithful old cloak that was the twin of Father Vaillants. They had bought the cloth for those coats in Paris, long ago, when they were young men staying at the Seminary for Foreign Missions in the rue du Bac, preparing for their first voyage to the New World. The cloth had been made up into caped 212 THE GREAT DIOCESE riding-cloaks by a German tailor in Ohio, and lined with fox fur. Years afterward, when Father Latour was about to start on his long journey in search of his Bishopric, that same tailor had made the cloaks over and relined them with squirrel skins, as more appropriate for a mild climate. These memories and many others went through the Bishops mind as he wrapped the trusty garment about him and crossed the court to the sacristy, with the big iron key in his hand. The court was white with snow, and the shadows of walls and buildings stood out sharply in the faint light from the moon muffled in vapour. In the deep doorway of the sacristy he saw a crouching figure a woman, he made out, and she was weeping bitterly. He raised her up and took her inside. As soon as he had lit a candle, he recognized her, and could have guessed her errand. It was an old Mexican woman, called Sada, who was slave in an American family. They were Protes- tants, very hostile to the Roman Church, and they did not allow her to go to Mass or to receive the visits of a priest. She was carefully watched at home, but in winter, when the heated rooms of the house were desirable to the family, she was put to sleep in a woodshed. To-night, unable to sleep for the cold, she had gathered courage for this heroic action, had slipped out through the stable door and come run- 213 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP ning up an alley-way to the House of God to pray. Finding the front doors of the church fastened, she had made her way into the Bishops garden and come round to the sacristy, only to find that, too, shut against her. The Bishop stood holding the candle and watch- ing her face while she spoke her few words; a dark brown peon face, worn thin and sharp by life and sorrow. It seemed to him that he had never seen pure goodness shine out of a human countenance as it did from hers. He saw that she had no stockings under her shoes, the cast-off rawhides of her master, and beneath her frayed black shawl was only a thin calico dress, covered with patches. Her teeth struck together as she stood trying to control her shivering. With one movement of his free hand the Bishop took the furred cloak from his shoulders and put it about her. This frightened her. She cowered under it, murmuring, Ah, no, no, Padre! You must obey your Padre, my daughter. Draw that cloak about you, and we will go into the church to pray. The church was utterly black except for the red spark of the sanctuary lamp before the high altar. Taking her hand, and holding the candle before him, he led her across the choir to the Lady Chapel. There he began to light the tapers before the Virgin. Old Sada fell on her knees and kissed the floor. 214 THE GREAT DIOCESE She kissed the feet of the Holy Mother, the pedestal on which they stood, crying all the while. But from the working of her face, from the beautiful tremors which passed over it, he knew they were tears of ecstasy. Nineteen years, Father; nineteen years since I have seen the holy things of the altar! All that is passed, Sada. You have remembered the holy things in your heart. We will pray together. The Bishop knelt beside her, and they began, O Holy Mary, Queen of Virgins... . More than once Father Vaillant had spoken to the Bishop of this aged captive. There had been much whispering among the devout women of the parish about her pitiful case. The Smiths, with whom she lived, were Georgia people, who had at one time lived in El Paso del Norte, and they had taken her back to their native State with them. Not long ago some disgrace had come upon this family in Georgia, they had been forced to sell all their negro slaves and flee the State. The Mexican woman they could not sell because they had no legal title to her, her position was irregular. Now that",no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,64,"they were back in a Mexican country, the Smiths were afraid their char- woman might escape from them and find asylum among her own people, so they kept strict watch upon her. They did not allow her to go outside their own patio, not even to accompany her mistress to market. Two women of the Altar Guild had been so 215 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP bold as to go into the patio to talk with Sada when she was washing clothes, but they had been rudely driven away by the mistress of the house. Mrs. Smith had come running out into the court, half dressed, and told them that if they had business at her casa they were to come in by the front door, and not sneak in through the stable to frighten a poor silly creature. When they said they had come to ask Sada to go to Mass with them, she told them she had got the poor creature out of the clutches of the priests once, and would see to it that she did not fall into them again. Even after that rebuff a very pious neighbour woman had tried to say a word to Sada through the alley door of the stable, where she was unloading wood off the burro. But the old servant had put her finger to her lips and motioned the visitor away, glancing back over her shoulder the while with such an expression of terror that the intruder has- tened off, surmising that Sada would be harshly used if she were caught speaking to anyone. The good woman went immediately to Father Vaillant with this story, and he had consulted the Bishop, declaring that something ought to be done to secure the consolations of religion for the bond-woman. But the Bishop replied that the time was not yet; for the present it was inexpedient to antagonize these people. The Smiths were the leaders of a small 216 THE GREAT DIOCESE group of low-caste Protestants who took every occasion to make trouble for the Catholics. They hung about the door of the church on festival days with mockery and loud laughter, spoke insolently to the nuns in the street, stood jeering and blas- pheming when the procession went by on Corpus Christi Sunday. There were five sons in the Smith family, fellows of low habits and evil tongues. Even the two younger boys, still children, showed a vicious disposition. Tranquilino had repeatedly driven these two boys out of the Bishops garden, where they came with their lewd companions to rob the young pear trees or to speak filth against the priests. When they rose from their knees, Father Latour told Sada he was glad to know that she remembered her prayers so well. Ah, Padre, every night I say my Rosary to my Holy Mother, no matter where I sleep! declared the old creature passionately, looking up into his face and pressing her knotted hands against her breast. When he asked if she had her beads with her, she was confused. She kept them tied with a cord around her waist, under her clothes, as the only place she could hide them safely. He spoke soothingly to her. Remember this, Sada; in the year to come, and during the Novena before Christmas, I will not forget to pray for you 217 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP whenever I offer the Blessed Sacrament of the Mass. Be at rest in your heart, for I will remember you in my silent supplications before the altar as I do my own sisters and my nieces. Never, as he afterward told Father Vaillant, had it been permitted him to behold such deep experi- ence of the holy joy of religion as on that pale De- cember night. He was able to feel, kneeling beside her, the preciousness of the things of the altar to her who was without possessions; the tapers, the image of the Virgin, the figures of the saints, the Cross that took away indignity from suffering and made pain and poverty a means of fellowship with Christ. Kneeling beside the much enduring bond- woman, he experienced those holy mysteries as he had done in his young manhood. He seemed able to feel all it meant to her to know that there was a Kind Woman in Heaven, though there were such cruel ones on earth. Old people, who have felt blows and toil and known the worlds hard hand, need, even more than children do, a womans tenderness. Only a Woman, divine, could know all that a woman can suffer. Not often, indeed, had Jean Marie Latour come so near to the Fountain of all Pity as in the Lady Chapel that night; the pity that no man born of woman could",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,65,"ever utterly cut himself off from; that was for the murderer on the scaffold, as it was 218 THE GREAT DIOCESE for the dying soldier or the martyr on the rack. The beautiful concept of Mary pierced the priests heart like a sword. O Sacred Heart of Mary! she murmured by his side, and he felt how that name was food and raiment, friend and mother to her. He received the miracle in her heart into his own, saw through her eyes, knew that his poverty was as bleak as hers. When the Kingdom of Heaven had first come into the world, into a cruel world of torture and slaves and masters, He who brought it had said, And whosoever is least among you, the same shall be first in the Kingdom of Heaven. This church was Sadas house, and he was a servant in it. The Bishop heard the old womans confession. He blessed her and put both hands upon her head. When he took her down the nave to let her out of the church, Sada made to lift his cloak from her shoulders. He restrained her, telling her she must keep it for her own, and sleep in it at night. But she slipped out of it hurriedly; such a thought seemed to terrify her. No, no, Father. If they were to find it on me! More than that, she did not accuse her oppressors. But as she put it off, she stroked the old garment and patted it as if it were a living thing that had been kind to her. Happily Father Latour bethought him of a little silver medal, with a figure of the Virgin, he had in 219 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP his pocket. He gave it to her, telling her that it had been blessed by the Holy Father himself. Now she would have a treasure to hide and guard, to adore while her watchers slept. Ah, he thought, for one who cannot read or think the Image, the physi- cal form of Love! He fitted the great key into its lock, the door swung slowly back on its wooden hinges. The peace without seemed all one with the peace in his own soul. The snow had stopped, the gauzy clouds that had ribbed the arch of heaven were now all sunk into one soft white fog bank over the Sangre de Cristo mountains. The full moon shone high in the blue vault, majestic, lonely, benign. The Bishop stood in the doorway of his church, lost in thought, looking at the line of black footprints his departing visitor had left in the wet scurf of snow. SPRING IN THE NAVAJO COUNTRY 3 F arsen VAILLANT was away in Arizona all winter. When the first hint of spring was in the air, the Bishop and Jacinto set out on a long ride across 220 THE GREAT DIOCESE New Mexico, to the Painted Desert and the Hopi villages. After they left Oraibi, the Bishop rode several days to the south, to visit a Navajo friend who had lately lost his only son, and who had paid the Bishop the compliment of sending word of the boys death to him at Santa F. Father Latour had known Eusabio a long while, had met him soon after he first came to his new diocese. The Navajo was in Santa F at that time, assisting the military officers to quiet an outbreak of the never-ending quarrel between his people and the Hopis. Ever since then the Bishop and the Indian chief had entertained an increasing regard for each other. Eusabio brought his son all the way to Santa F to have the Bishop baptize him, that one be- loved son who had died during this last winter. Though he was ten years younger than Father Latour, Eusabio was one of the most influential men among the Navajo people, and one of the richest in sheep and horses. In Santa F and Albuquerque he was respected for his intelligence and authority, and admired for his fine presence. He was extremely tall, even for a Navajo, with a face like a Roman generals of Republican times. He always dressed very elegantly in velvet and buckskin rich with bead and quill em- broidery, belted with silver, and wore a blanket of the finest wool and design. His arms, under the loose sleeves of his shirt, were covered with silver bracelets, 221 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP and on his breast hung very old necklaces of wampum and turquoise and coral Mediterranean coral, that had been left in the Navajo country by Coronados captains when they passed through it on their way to discover the Hopi villages and the Grand Canyon. Eusabio lived, with his relatives and dependents, in a",no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,66,"group of hogans on the Colorado Chiquito; to the west and south and north his kinsmen herded his great flocks. Father Latour and Jacinto arrived at the cluster of booth-like cabins during a high sandstorm, which circled about them and their mules like snow in a blizzard and all but obliterated the landscape. The Navajo came out of his house and took possession of Angelica by her bridle-bit. At first he did not open his lips, merely stood holding Father Latours very fine white hand in his very fine dark one, and looked into his face with a message of sorrow and resigna- tion in his deep-set, eagle eyes. A wave of feeling passed over his bronze features as he said slowly: My friend has come. That was all, but it was everything; welcome, confidence, appreciation. For his lodging the Bishop was given a solitary hogan, a little apart from the settlement. Eusabio quickly furnished it with his best skins and blankets, and told his guest that he must tarry a few days there and recover from his fatigue. His mules were 222 THE GREAT DIOCESE tired, the Indian said, the Padre himself looked weary, and the way to Santa F was long. The Bishop thanked him and said he would stay three days; that he had need for reflection. His mind had been taken up with practical matters ever since he left home. This seemed a spot where a man might get his thoughts together. The river, a con- siderable stream at this time of the year, wound among mounds and dunes of loose sand which whirled through the air all day in the boisterous spring winds. The sand banked up against the hogan the Bishop occupied, and filtered through chinks in the walls, which were made of saplings plastered with clay. Beside the river was a grove of tall, naked cotton- woods trees of great antiquity and enormous size so large that they seemed to belong to a bygone age. They grew far apart, and their strange twisted shapes must have come about from the ceaseless winds that bent them to the east and scoured them with sand, and from the fact that they lived with very little water, the river was nearly dry here for most of the year. The trees rose out of the ground at a slant, and forty or fifty feet above the earth all these white, dry trunks changed their direction, grew back over their base line. Some split into great forks which arched down almost to the ground; some did not fork at all, but the main trunk dipped downward in a strong curve, as if drawn by a bow- 223 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP string; and some terminated in a thick coruscation of growth, like a crooked palm tree. They were all living trees, yet they seemed to be of old, dead, dry wood, and had very scant foliage. High up in the forks, or at the end of a preposterous length of twisted bough, would burst a faint bouquet of delicate green leaves out of all keeping with the great lengths of seasoned white trunk and branches. The grove looked like a winter wood of giant trees, with clusters of mistletoe growing among the bare boughs. Navajo hospitality is not intrusive. Eusabio made the Bishop understand that he was glad to have him there, and let him alone. Father Latour lived for three days in an almost perpetual sand-storm cut off from even this remote little Indian camp by moving walls and tapestries of sand. He either sat in his house and listened to the wind, or walked trees, abroad under those aged, wind-distorted muffled in an Indian blanket, which he kept drawn up over his mouth and nose. Since his arrival he had undertaken to decide whether he would be justified in recalling Father Vaillant from Tucson. The Vicars occasional letters, brought by travellers, showed that he was highly content where he was, restoring the old mission church of St. Xavier del Bac, which he declared to be the most beautiful church on the continent, though it had been neglected for more than two hundred years. 224 ~ THE GREAT DIOCESE Since Father Vaillant went away the Bishops burdens had grown heavier and heavier. The new priests from Auvergne were all good men, faithful and untiring in carrying out his wishes; but they were still strangers to the country, timid about making decisions, and referred every difficulty to their Bishop. Father Latour needed his Vicar, who had so much tact with the natives, so much sympathy with all their short-comings. When they were together, he was always curbing Father Vaillants hopeful rash- ness but left alone, he greatly missed that very quality. And he missed Father Vaillants compan-",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,67,"ionship why not admit it? Although Jean Marie Latour and Joseph Vaillant were born in neighbouring parishes in the Puy-de- Dm, as children they had not known each other. The Latours were an old family of scholars and professional men, while the Vaillants were people of a much humbler station in the provincial world. Besides, little Joseph had been away from home much of the time, up on the farm in the Volvic mountains with his grandfather, where the air was especially pure, and the country quiet salutary for a child of nervous temperament. The two boys had not come together until they were Seminarians at Mont- ferrand, in Clermont. When Jean Marie was in his second year at the Seminary, he was standing on the recreation ground 225 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP one day at the opening of the term, looking with curiosity at the new students. In the group, he noticed one of peculiarly unpromising appearance; a boy of nineteen who was undersized, very pale, homely in feature, with a wart on his chin and tow-coloured hair that made him look like a German. This boy seemed to feel his glance, and came up at once, as if he had been called. He was apparently quite unconscious of his homeliness, was not at all shy, but intensely interested in his new surroundings. He asked Jean Latour his name, where he came from, and his fathers occupation. Then he said with great simplicity: My father is a baker, the best in Riom. In fact, hes a remarkable baker. Young Latour was amused, but expressed polite appreciation of this confidence. The queer lad went on to tell him about his brother and his aunt, and his clever little sister, Philomne. He asked how long Latour had been at the Seminary. Have you always intended to take orders? So have I, but I very nearly went into the army instead. The year previous, after the surrender of Algiers, there had been a military review at Clermont, a great display of uniforms and military bands, and stirring speeches about the glory of French arms. Young Joseph Vaillant had lost his head in the excitement, and had signed up for a volunteer with- out consulting his father. He gave Latour a vivid 226 THE GREAT DIOCESE account of his patriotic emotions, of his fathers displeasure, and his own subsequent remorse. His mother had wished him to become a priest. She died when he was thirteen, and ever since then he had meant to carry out her wish and to dedicate his life to the service of the Divine Mother. But that one day, among the bands and the uniforms, he had forgotten everything but his desire to serve France. Suddenly young Vaillant broke off, saying that he must write a letter before the hour was over, and tucking up his gown he ran away at full speed. Latour stood looking after him, resolved that he would take this new boy under his protection. There was something about the bakers son that had given their meeting the colour of an adventure; he meant to repeat it. In that first encounter, he chose the lively, ugly boy for his friend. It was instantaneous. Latour himself was much cooler and more critical in temper; hard to please, and often a little grey in mood. During their Seminary years he had easily sur- passed his friend in scholarship, but he always realized that Joseph excelled him in the fervour of his faith. After they became missionaries, Joseph had learned to speak English, and later, Spanish, more readily than he. To be sure, he spoke both languages very incorrectly at first, but he had no vanity about grammar or refinement of phrase. e724 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP To communicate with peons, he was quite willing to speak like a peon. Though the Bishop had worked with Father Joseph for twenty-five years now, he could not reconcile the contradictions of his nature. He simply accepted them, and, when Joseph had been away for a long while, realized that he loved them all. His Vicar was one of the most truly spiritual men he had ever known, though he was so passionately attached to many of the things of this world. Fond as he was of good eating and drinking, he not only rigidly ob- served all the fasts of the Church, but he never complained about the hardness and scantiness of the fare on his long missionary journeys. Father Josephs relish for good wine might have been a fault in an- other man. But always frail in body, he seemed to need some quick physical stimulant to support his sudden flights of purpose and imagination. Time and again the Bishop had seen a good dinner, a bottle",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,68,"of claret, transformed into spiritual energy under his very eyes. From a little feast that would make other men heavy and desirous of repose, Father Vaillant would rise up revived, and work for ten or twelve hours with that ardour and thoroughness which accomplished such lasting results. The Bishop had often been embarrassed by his Vicars persistence in begging for the parish, for the Cathedral fund and the distant missions. Yet for 228 THE GREAT DIOCESE himself, Father Joseph was scarcely acquisitive to the point of decency. He owned nothing in the world but his mule, Contento. Though he received rich vestments from his sister in Riom, his daily apparel was rough and shabby. The Bishop had a large and valuable library, at least, and many com- forts for his house. There were his beautiful skins and blankets presents from Eusabio and his other Indian friends. The Mexican women, skilled in needlework and lace-making and hem-stitching, presented him with fine linen for his person, his bed, and his table. He had silver plate, given him by the Olivares and others of his rich parishioners. But Father Vaillant was like the saints of the early Church, literally without personal possessions. In his youth, Joseph had wished to lead a life of seclusion and solitary devotion; but the truth was, he could not be happy for long without human intercourse. And he liked almost everyone. In Ohio, when they used to travel together in stage- coaches, Father Latour had noticed that every time a new passenger pushed his way into the already crowded stage, Joseph would look pleased and interested, as if this were an agreeable addition whereas he himself felt annoyed, even if he con- cealed it. The ugly conditions of life in Ohio had never troubled Joseph. The hideous houses and churches, the ill-kept farms and gardens, the slovenly, 229 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP sordid aspect of the towns and country-side, which continually depressed Father Latour, he seemed scarcely to perceive. One would have said he had no feeling for comeliness or grace. Yet music was a passion with him. In Sandusky it had been his de- light to spend evening after evening with his German choir-master, training the young people to sing Bach oratorios. Nothing one could say of Father Vaillant explained him. The man was much greater than the sum of his qualities. He added a glow to whatever kind of human society he was dropped down into. A Navajo hogan, some abjectly poor little huddle of Mexican huts, or a company of Monsignori and Cardinals at Rome it was all the same. The last time the Bishop was in Rome he had heard an amusing story from Monsignor Mazzucchi, who had been secretary to Gregory XVI at the time when Father Vaillant went from his Ohio mission for his first visit to the Holy City. Joseph had stayed in Rome for three months, liv- ing on about forty cents a day and leaving nothing unseen. He several times asked Mazzucchi to secure him a private audience with the Pope. The secretary liked the missionary from Ohio; there was something abrupt and lively and naif about him, a kind of fresh- ness he did not often find in the priests who flocked to Rome. So he arranged an interview at which only 230 THE GREAT DIOCESE the Holy Father and Father Vaillant and Mazzucchi > were present. The missionary came in, attended by a chamber- lam who carried two great black valises full of objects to be blessed instead of one, as was customary. After his reception, Father Joseph began to pour out such a vivid account of his missions and brother missionaries, that both the Holy Father and the secretary forgot to take account of time, and the audience lasted three times as long as such interviews were supposed to last. Gregory XVI, that aristo- cratic and autocratic prelate, who stood so con- sistently on the wrong side in European politics, and was the enemy of Free Italy, had done more than any of his predecessors to propagate the Faith in remote parts of the world. And here was a missionary after his own heart. Father Vaillant asked for bless- ings for himself, his fellow priests, his missions, his Bishop. He opened his big valises like pedlars packs, full of crosses, rosaries, prayer-books, medals, brevi- aries, on which he begged more than the usual blessing. The astonished chamberlain had come and gone several times, and Mazzucchi at last reminded the Holy Father that he had other engagements. Father Vaillant caught up his two valises himself, the chamberlain not being there at the moment, and thus laden, was bowing himself backward out of the presence, when the Pope rose from Ais chair 231 DEATH COMES FOR THE",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

Bishop Latour found his Navajo house favourable for reflection, for recalling the past and planning the future. He wrote long letters to his brother and to old friends in France. The hogan was isolated like a ships cabin on the ocean, with the murmuring of great winds about it. There was no opening except the door, always open, and the air without had the turbid yellow light of sand-storms. All day long the sand came in through the cracks in the walls and formed little ridges on the earth floor. It rattled like sleet upon the dead leaves of the tree-branch roof. This house was so frail a shelter that one seemed to be sitting in the heart of a world made of dusty earth and moving air. 4 EUSABIO ) xi the third day of his nasi gritheRusabiomine Bishop wrote a somewhat formal letter of recall to his Vicar, and then went for his daily walk in the 232 THE GREAT DIOCESE desert. He stayed out until sunset, when the wind fell and the air cleared _to a crystal sharpness. As he was returning, still a mile or more up the river, he heard the deep sound of a cottonwood drum, beaten softly. He surmised that the sound came from Eusabios house, and that his friend was at home. ; Retracing his steps to the settlement, Father Latour found Eusabio seated beside his doorway, singing in the Navajo language and beating softly on one end of his long drum. Before him two very little Indian boys, about four and five years old, were dancing to the music, on the hard beaten ground. Two women, Eusabios wife and sister, looked on from the deep twilight of the hut. The little boys did not notice the strangers ap- proach. They were entirely engrossed in their occupa- tion, their faces serious, their chocolate-coloured eyes half closed. The Bishop stood watching the flowing, supple movements of their arms and shoulders, the sure rhythm of their tiny moccasined feet, no larger than cottonwood leaves, as without a word of in- struction they followed the irregular and strangely- accented music. Eusabio himself wore an expression of religious gravity. He sat with the drum between his knees, his broad shoulders bent forward; a crimson banda covered his forehead to hold his black hair. The silver on his dark wrists glittered as he 233 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP stroked the drum-head with a stick or merely tapped it with his fingers. When he finished the song he was singing, he rose and introduced the little boys, his nephews, by their Indian names, Eagle Feather and Medicine Mountain, after which he nodded to them in dismissal. They vanished into the house. Eusabio handed the drum to his wife and walked away with his guest. Eusabio, said the Bishop, I want to send a letter to Father Vaillant, at Tucson. I will send Jacinto with it, provided you can spare me one of your people to accompany me back to Santa F. T myself will ride with you to the Villa, said Eusabio. The Navajos still called the capital by its old name. Accordingly, on the following morning, Jacinto was dispatched southward, and Father Latour and Eusabio, with their pack-mule, rode to the east. The ride back to Santa F was something under four hundred miles. The weather alternated between blinding sand-storms and brilliant sunlight. The sky was as full of motion and change as the desert beneath it was monotonous and still, and there was so much sky, more than at sea, more than any- where else in the world. The plain was there, under ones feet, but what one saw when one looked about was that brilliant blue world of stinging air and mov- ing cloud. Even the mountains were mere ant-hills 234 THE GREAT DIOCESE under it. Elsewhere the sky is the roof of the world; but here the earth was. the floor of the sky. The landscape one longed for when one was far away, the thing all about one, the world one actually lived in, was the sky, the sky! Travelling with Eusabio was like travelling with the landscape made human. He accepted chance and weather as the country did, with a sort of grave enjoyment. He talked little, ate little, slept any- where, preserved a countenance open and warm, and like Jacinto he had unfailing good manners. The Bishop was rather surprised that he stopped so often by the way to gather flowers. One morning he came back with the mules, holding a bunch of crimson flowerslong, tube-shaped bells, that hung lightly from one side of",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes

When they left the rock or tree or sand dune that had sheltered them for the night, the Navajo was careful to obliterate every trace of their temporary occupation. He buried the embers of the fire and the remnants of food, unpiled any stones he had piled together, filled up the holes he had scooped in the sand. Since this was exactly Jacintos procedure, Father Latour judged that, just as it was the white 235 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP mans way to assert himself in any landscape, to change it, make it over a little (at least to leave some mark or memorial of his sojourn), it was the Indians way to pass through a country without disturbing anything; to pass and leave no trace, like fish through the water, or birds through the air. It was the Indian manner to vanish into the landscape, not to stand out against it. The Hopi villages that were set upon rock mesas, were made to look like the rock on which they sat, were im- perceptible at a distance. The Navajo hogans, among the sand and willows, were made of sand and willows. None of the pueblos would at that time admit glass windows into their dwellings. The reflection of the sun on the glazing was to them ugly and un- natural even dangerous. Moreover, these Indians disliked novelty and change. They came and went by the old paths worn into the rock by the feet of their fathers, used the old natural stairway of stone to climb to their mesa towns, carried water from the old springs, even after white men had dug wells. In the working of silver or drilling of turquoise the Indians had exhaustless patience; upon their blankets and belts and ceremonial robes they lavished their skill and pains. But their conception of decoration did not extend to the landscape. They seemed to have none of the Europeans desire to master 236 THE GREAT DIOCESE nature, to arrange and re-create. They spent their ingenuity in the other direction; in accommodating themselves to the scene in which they found them- selves. This was not so much from indolence, the Bishop thought, as from an inherited caution and respect. It was as if the great country were asleep, and they wished to carry on their lives without awakening it; or as if the spirits of earth and air and water were things not to antagonize and arouse. When they hunted, it was with the same discretion; an Indian hunt was never a slaughter. They ravaged neither the rivers nor the forest, and if they irrigated, they took as little water as would serve their needs. The land and all that it bore they treated with con- sideration; not attempting to improve it, they never desecrated it. As Father Latour and Eusabio approached Albu- querque, they occasionally fell in with company; Indians going to and fro on the long winding trails across the plain, or up into the Sandia mountains. They had all of them the same quiet way of moving, whether their pace was swift or slow, and the same unobtrusive demeanour: an Indian wrapped in his bright blanket, seated upon his mule or walking beside it, moving through the pale new-budding sage-brush, winding among the sand waves, as if it were his business to pass unseen and unheard through a country awakening with spring. 237 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP North of Laguna two Zufi runners sped by them, going somewhere east on Indian business. They saluted Eusabio by gestures with the open palm, but did not stop. They coursed over the sand with the fleetness of young antelope, their bodies disappearing and reappearing among the sand dunes, like the shadows that eagles cast in their strong, unhurried flight. 238 BOOK EIGHT GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK I CATHEDRAL ATHER VAILLANT had been in Santa F nearly three weeks, and as yet nothing had been revealed to him that warranted his Bishop in calling him back from Tucson. One morning Fructosa came into the garden to tell him that lunch would be earlier than usual, as the Bishop was going to ride somewhere that afternoon. Half an hour later he joined his superior in the dining-room, The Bishop seldom lunched alone. That was the hour when he could most conveniently entertain a priest from one of the distant parishes, an army officer, an American trader, a visitor from Old Mexico or California. He had no parlour his dining-room served that purpose. It was long and cool, with windows only at the west end, opening into the garden. The green j alousies",no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes

When Madame Olivares left Santa F to return to New Orleans and sold her effects at auction, Father Latour bought her sideboard, and the dining- table around which friends had so often gathered. Dofia Isabella gave him her silver coffee service and candelabra for remembrance. They were the only ornaments of the severe and shadowy room. The Bishop was already at his place when Father Joseph entered. Fructosa has told you why we are lunching early? We will take a ride this afternoon. I have something to show you. Very good. Perhaps you have noticed that I am a little restless. I dont know when I have been two weeks out of the saddle before. When I go to visit Contento in his stall, he looks at me reprov- ingly. He will grow too fat. The Bishop smiled, with a shade of sarcasm on his upper lip. He knew his Joseph. Ah, well, he said carelessly, a little rest will not hurt him, after coming six hundred miles from Tucson. You can take him out this afternoon, and I will ride Angelica. The two priests left Santa F a little after midday, riding west. The Bishop did not disclose his objective, and the Vicar asked no questions. Soon they left the wagon road and took a trail running straight south, through an empty greasewood country sloping gradu- 240 GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK ally in the direction of the naked, blue Sandia moun- tains. At about four oclock they came out upon a ridge high over the Rio Grande valley. The trail dropped down a long decline at this point and wound about the foot of the Sandias into Albuquerque, some sixty miles away. This ridge was covered with cone- shaped, rocky hills, thinly clad with pifions, and the rock was a curious shade of green, something be- tween sea-green and olive. The thin, pebbly earth, which was merely the rock pulverized by weather, had the same green tint. Father Latour rode to an isolated hill that beetled over the western edge of the ridge, just where the trail descended. This hill stood up high and quite alone, boldly facing the declining sun and the blue Sandias. As they drew close to it, Father Vaillant noticed that on the western face the earth had been scooped away, exposing a rugged wall of rock not green like the surrounding hills, but yellow, a strong golden ochre, very much like the gold of the sunlight that was now beating upon it. Picks and crowbars lay about, and fragments of stone, freshly broken off. Tt is curious, is it not, to find one yellow hill among all these green ones? remarked the Bishop, stooping to pick up a piece of the stone. T have ridden over these hills in every direction, but this is the only one of its kind. He stood regarding the 241 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP chip of yellow rock that lay in his palm. As he had a very special way of handling objects that were sacred, he extended that manner to things which he considered beautiful. After a moment of silence he looked up at the rugged wall, gleaming gold above them. That hill, Blanchet, is my Cathedral. Father Joseph looked at his Bishop, then at the cliff, blinking. Vrazment? Is the stone hard enough? A good colour, certainly; something like the colon- nade of St. Peters. The Bishop smoothed the piece of rock with his thumb. It is more like something nearer home I mean, nearer Clermont. When I look up at this rock I can almost feel the Rhone behind me. Ah, you mean the old Palace of the Popes, at Avignon! Yes, you are right, it is very like. At this hour, it is like this. The Bishop sat down on a boulder, still looking up at the cliff. It is the stone I have always wanted, and I found it quite by chance. I was coming back from Isleta. I had been to see old Padre Jesus when he was dying. I had never come by this trail, but when I reached Santo Domingo I found the road so washed by a heavy rain that I turned out and decided to try this way home. I rode up here from the west in the late afternoon; this hill confronted me as it confronts us now, and I knew instantly that it was my Cathedral. 242 GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK Oh, such things are never accidents, Jean. But it will be a long while before you can think of build- ing. Not so very long, I",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,72,"hope. I should like to com- plete it before I die if God so wills. I wish to leave nothing to chance, or to the mercy of American builders. I had rather keep the old adobe church we have now than help to build one of those horrible structures they are putting up in the Ohio cities. I want a plain church, but I want a good one. I shall certainly never lift my hand to build a clumsy affair of red brick, like an English coach-house. Our own Midi Romanesque is the right style for this country. Father Vaillant sniffed and wiped his glasses. Tf you once begin thinking about architects and styles, Jean! And if you dont get American builders, whom will you get, pray? T have an old friend in Toulouse who is a very fine architect. I talked this matter over with him when I was last at home. He cannot come himself; he is afraid of the long sea voyage, and not used to horseback travel. But he has a young son, still at his studies, who is eager to undertake the work. Indeed, his father writes me that it has become the young mans dearest ambition to build the first Roman- esque church in the New World. He will have stud- ied the right models; he thinks our old churches of the Midi the most beautiful in France. When we are 243 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP ready, he will come and bring with him a couple of good French stone-cutters. They will certainly be no more expensive than workmen from St. Louis. Now that I have found exactly the stone I want, my Cathedral seems to me already begun. This hill is only about fifteen miles from Santa F; there is an up-grade, but it is gradual. Hauling the stone will be easier than I could have hoped for. You plan far ahead, Father Vaillant looked at his friend wonderingly. Well, that is what a Bishop should be able to do. As for me, I see only what is under my nose. But I had no idea you were going in for fine building, when everything about us is so poor and we ourselves are so poor. But the Cathedral is not for us, Father Joseph. We build for the future better not lay a stone unless we can do that. It would be a shame to any man coming from a Seminary that is one of the architectural treasures of France, to make another ugly church on this continent where there are so many already. You are probably right. I had never thought of it before. It never occurred to me that we could have anything but an Ohio church here. Your ancestors helped to build Clermont Cathedral, I remember; two building Bishops de la Tour back in the thir- teenth century. Time brings things to pass, certainly. I had no idea you were taking all this so much to heart. 244 GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK Father Latour laughed. Is a cathedral a thing to be taken lightly, after all? Oh, no, certainly not! Father Vaillant moved his shoulders uneasily. He did not himself know why he hung back in this. The base of the hill before which they stood was already in shadow, subdued to the tone of rich yellow clay, but the top was still melted gold a colour that throbbed in the last rays of the sun. The Bishop turned away at last with a sigh of deep content. Yes, he said slowly, that rock will do very well. And now we must be starting home. Every time I come here, I like this stone better. I could hardly have hoped that God would gratify my personal taste, my vanity, if you will, in this way. I tell you, Blanchet, I would rather have found that hill of yellow rock than have come into a fortune to spend in charity. The Cathedral is near my heart, for many reasons. I hope you do not think me very worldly. As they rode home through the sage-brush silvered by moonlight, Father Vaillant was still wondering why he had been called home from saving souls in Arizona, and wondering why a poor missionary Bishop should care so much about a building. He himself was eager to have the Cathedral begun; but whether it was Midi Romanesque or Ohio Ger- man in style, seemed to him of little consequence. 245 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP A LETTER FROM LEAVENWORTH Ta day after the Bishop and his Vicar rode to the yellow rock the weekly post arrived at Santa F. It brought the Bishop many letters, and he was shut in his study all morning. At lunch he told Father Vaillant that he would",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,73,"require his company that evening to consider with him a letter of great importance from the Bishop of Leavenworth. This letter of many pages was concerned with events that were happening in Colorado, in a part of the Rocky Mountains very little known. Though it was only a few hundred miles north of Santa F, communication with that region was so infrequent that news travelled to Santa F from Europe more quickly than from Pikes Peak. Under the shadow of that peak rich gold deposits had been discovered within the last year, but Father Vaillant had first heard of this through a letter from France. Word of it had reached the Atlantic coast, crossed to Europe, and come from there back to the Southwest, more quickly than it could filter down through the few hundred miles of unexplored mountains and gorges between Cripple Creek and Santa F. While Father Vaillant was at Tucson he had received a letter from 246 GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK his brother Marius, in Auvergne, and was vexed that so much of it was taken up with inquiries about the gold rush to Colorado, of which he had never heard, while Marius gave him but little news of the war in Italy, which seemed relatively near and much more important. That congested heaping up of the Rocky Moun- tain chain about Pikes Peak was a blank space on the continent at this time. Even the fur trappers, coming down from Wyoming to Taos with their pelts, avoided that humped granite backbone. Only a few years before, Frmont had tried to pene- trate the Colorado Rockies, and his party had come half-starved into Taos at last, having eaten most of their horses. But within twelve months everything had changed. Wandering prospectors had found large deposits of gold near Cripple Creek, and the mountains that were solitary a year ago were now full of people. Wagon trains were streaming west- ward across the prairies from the Missouri River. The Bishop of Leavenworth wrote Father Latour that he himself had just returned from a visit to Cripple Creek. He had found the slopes under Pikes Peak dotted with camps, the gorges black with placer miners; thousands of people were living in tents and shacks, Cherry Creek was full of saloons and gam- bling-rooms; and among all the wanderers and wastrels were many honest men, hundreds of good 247 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Catholics, and not one priest. The young men were adrift in a lawless society without spiritual guidance. The old men died from exposure and mountain pneumonia, with no one to give them the last rites of the Church. This new and populous community must, for the present, the Kansas Bishop wrote, be accounted under Father Latours jurisdiction. His great diocese, already enlarged by thousands of square miles to the south and west, must now, on the north, take in the still undefined but suddenly important region of the Colorado Rockies. The Bishop of Leavenworth begged him to send a priest there as soon as possible, an able one, by all means, not only devoted, but resourceful and intelligent, one who would be at his ease with all sorts of men. He must take his bedding and camp outfit, medicines and provisions, and clothing for the severe winter. At Camp Denver there was nothing to be bought but tobacco and whisky. There were no women there, and no cook stoves. The miners lived on half-baked dough and alcohol. They did not even keep the mountain water pure, and so died of fever. All the living conditions were abominable. In the evening, after dinner, Father Latour read this letter aloud to Father Vaillant in his study. When he had finished, he put down the closely written pages. ; 248 GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK You have been complaining of inactivity, Father Joseph; here is your opportunity. Father Joseph, who had been growing more and more restless during the reading of the letter, said merely: So now I must begin speaking English again! I can start to-morrow if you wish it. The Bishop shook his head. Not so fast. There will be no hospitable Mexicans to receive you at the end of this journey. You must take your living with you. We will have a wagon built for you, and choose your outfit carefully. Tranquilinos brother, Sabino, will be your driver. This, I fear, will be the hardest mission you have ever undertaken. The two priests talked until a late hour. There was Arizona to be considered; somebody must be found to continue Father Vaillants work there. Of all the countries he knew, that desert and its yellow people were the dearest to him. But it was the discipline of his life to break ties; to say farewell and move",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,74,"on into the unknown. Before he went to bed that night Father Joseph greased his boots and trimmed the calloused spots on his feet with an old razor. At the Mexican village of Chimayo, over toward the Truchas mountains, the good people were especially devoted to a little equestrian image of Santiago in their church, and they made him a new pair of boots every few months, insisting that he went abroad at night and wore 249 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP out his shoes, even on horseback. When Father Joseph stayed there, he used to tell them he wished that, in addition to the consecration of the hands, God had provided some special blessing for the mis- sionarys feet. He recalled affectionately an incident which con- cerned this Santiago of Chimayo. Some years ago Father Joseph was asked to go to the calabozo at Santa F to see a murderer from Chimayo. The prisoner proved to be a boy of twenty, very gentle in face and manner. His name was Ramon Armajillo. He had been passionately fond of cock-fighting, and it was his undoing. He had bred a rooster that never lost a battle, but had slit the necks of cocks in all the little towns about. At last Ramon brought the bird to Santa F to match him with a famous cock there, and half a dozen Chimayo boys came along and put up everything they had on Ramons rooster. The betting was heavy on both sides, and the gate receipts also were to go to the winner. After a some- what doubtful beginning, Ramons cock neatly ripped the jugular vein of his opponent; but the owner of the defeated bird, before anyone could stop him, reached into the ring and wrung the victors neck. Before he had dropped the limp bunch of feathers from his hand, Ramons knife was in his heart. It all happened in a flashsome of the witnesses even insisted that the death of the man and 250 GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK the death of the cock were simultaneous. All agreed that there was not time for a man to catch his breath between the whirl of the wrist and the gleam of the knife. Unfortunately the American judge was a very stupid man, who disliked Mexicans and hoped to wipe out cock-fighting. He accepted as evidence statements made by the murdered mans friends to the effect that Ramon had repeatedly threatened his life. When Father Vaillant went to see the boy in his cell a few days before his execution, he found him making a pair of tiny buckskin boots, as if for a doll, and Ramon told him they were for the little Santiago in the church at home. His family would come up to Santa F for the hanging, and they would take the boots back to Chimayo, and perhaps the little saint would say a good word for him. Rubbing oil into his boots by candlelight, Father Vaillant sighed. The criminals with whom he would have to do in Colorado would hardly be of that type, he told himself. 251 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP 3 AUSPICE MARIA! Tz construction of Father Vaillants wagon took a month. It must be a wagon of very unusual design, capable of carrying a great deal, yet light enough and narrow enough to wind through the mountain gorges beyond Pueblo, where there were no roads at all except the rocky ravines cut out by streams that flowed full in the spring but would be dry now in the autumn. While his wagon was building, Father Joseph was carefully selecting his stores, and the furnishings for a small chapel which he meant to construct of saplings or canvas immedi- ately upon his arrival at Camp Denver. Moreover, there were his valises full of medals, crosses, rosaries, coloured pictures and religious pamphlets. For himself, he required no books but his breviary and the ordinary of the Mass. In the Bishops courtyard he sorted and re-sorted his cargo, always finding a more necessary article for which a less necessary had to be discarded. Fructosa and Magdalena were frequently called upon to help him, and when a box was finally closed, Fructosa had it put away in the woodshed. She had noticed the Bishops brows contract slightly when he 252 GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK came upon these trunks and chests in his hallway and dining-room. All the bedding and clothing was packed in great sacks of dressed calfskin, which Sabino procured from old Mexican settlers. These were already going out of fashion, but in the early days they were the poor mans trunk. Bishop Latour also was very busy at this time, training a new priest from Clermont; riding about with him among the distant parishes and trying",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,75,"to give him an understanding of the people. As a Bishop, he could only approve Father Vaillants eagerness to be gone, and the enthusiasm with which he turned to hardships of a new kind. But as a man, he was a little hurt that his old comrade should leave him without one regret. He seemed to know, as if it had been revealed to him, that this was a final break; that their lives would part here, and that they would never work together again. The bustle of preparation in his own house was painful to him, and he was glad to be abroad among the parishes. One day when the Bishop had just returned from Albuquerque, Father Vaillant came in to luncheon in high spirits. He had been out for a drive in his new wagon, and declared that it was satisfactory at last. Sabino was ready, and he thought they would start the day after to-morrow. He diagrammed his route on the table-cloth, and went over the catalogue of his equipment. The Bishop was tired and scarcely 253 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP touched his food, but Father Joseph ate generously, as he was apt to do when fired by a new project. After Fructosa had brought the coffee, he leaned back in his chair and turned to his friend with a beaming face. I often think, Jean, how you were an unconscious agent in the hands of Providence when you recalled me from Tucson. I seemed to be doing the most important-work'of my life there, and you re- called me for no reason at all, apparently. You did not know why, and I did not know why. We were both acting in the dark. But Heaven knew what was happening at Cripple Creek, and moved us like chess- men on the board. When the call came, I was here to answer it by a miracle, indeed. Father Latour put down his silver coffee-cup. Miracles are all very well, Joseph, but I see none here. I sent for you because I felt the need of your companionship. I used my authority as a Bishop to gratify my personal wish. That was selfish, if you will, but surely natural enough. We are countrymen, and are bound by early memories. And that two friends, having come together, should part and go their separate ways that is natural, too. No, I dont think we need any miracle to explain all this. Father Vaillant had been wholly absorbed in his preparations for saving souls in the gold camps blind to everything else. Now it came over him in a flash, how the Bishop had held himself aloof from his 254 GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK activities; it was a very hard thing for Father Latour to let him go; the loneliness of his position had begun to weigh upon him. Yes, he reflected, as he went quietly to his own room, there was a great difference in their natures. Wherever he went, he soon made friends that took the place of country and family. But Jean, who was at ease in any society and always the flower of courtesy, could not form new ties. It had always been so. He was like that even as a boy; gracious to everyone, but known to a very few. To mans wis- dom it would have seemed that a priest with Father Latours exceptional qualities would have been better placed in some part of the world where scholar- ship, a handsome person, and delicate perceptions all have their effect; and that a man of much rougher type would have served God well enough as the first Bishop of New Mexico. Doubtless Bishop Latours successors would be men of a different fibre. But God had his reasons, Father Joseph devoutly be- lieved. Perhaps it pleased Him to grace the beginning of a new era and a vast new diocese by a fine per- sonality. And perhaps, after all, something would remain through the years to come; some ideal, or memory, or legend. The next afternoon, his wagon loaded and standing ready in the courtyard, Father Vaillant was seated at the Bishops desk, writing letters to France; a 255 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP short one to Marius, a long one to his beloved Philo- mne, telling her of his plunge into the unknown and begging her prayers for his success in the world of gold-crazed men. He wrote rapidly and jerkily, moving his lips as well as his fingers. When the Bishop entered the study, he rose and stood holding the written pages in his hand. T did not mean to interrupt you, Joseph, but do you intend to take Contento with you to Colorado? Father Joseph blinked. Why, certainly. I had intended to ride him. However,",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,76,"if you have need for him here Oh, no. Not at all. But if you take Contento, I will ask you to take Angelica as well. They have a great affection for each other; why separate them indefinitely? One could not explain to them. They have worked long together. Father Vaillant made no reply. He stood looking intently at the pages of his letter. The Bishop saw a drop of water splash down upon the violet script and spread. He turned quickly and went out through the arched doorway. At sunrise next morning Father Vaillant set out, Sabino driving the wagon, his oldest boy riding Angelica, and Father Joseph himself riding Contento. They took the old road to the north-east, through the sharp red sand-hills spotted with juniper, and the 256 GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK Bishop accompanied them as far as the loop where the road wound out on the'top of one of those conical hills, giving the departing traveller his last glimpse of Santa F. There Father Joseph drew rein and looked back at the town lying rosy in the morning light, the mountain behind it, and the hills close about it like two encircling arms. Auspice, Maria! he murmured as he turned his back on these familiar things. The Bishop rode home to his solitude. He was forty-seven years old, and he had been a missionary in the New World for twenty years ten of them in New Mexico. If he were a parish priest at home, there would be nephews coming to him for help in their Latin or a bit of pocket-money; nieces to run into his garden and bring their sewing and keep an eye on his housekeeping. All the way home he in- dulged in such reflections as any bachelor nearing fifty might have. But when he entered his study, he seemed to come back to reality, to the sense of a Presence awaiting him. The curtain of the arched doorway had scarcely fallen behind him when that feeling of personal lone- liness was gone, and a sense of loss was replaced by a sense of restoration. He sat down before his desk, deep in reflection. It was just this solitariness of love in which a priests life could be like his Masters. It was not a solitude of atrophy, of negation, but 257 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP of perpetual flowering. A life need not be cold, or devoid of grace in the worldly sense, if it were filled by Her who was all the graces; Virgin-daughter, Virgin-mother, girl of the people and Queen of Heaven: le rve suprme de la chair. The nursery tale could not vie with Her in simplicity, the wisest theologians could not match Her in profundity. Here in his own church in Santa F there was one of these nursery Virgins, a little wooden figure, very old and very dear to the people. De Vargas, when he recaptured the city for Spain two hundred years ago, had vowed a yearly procession in her honour, and it was still one of the most solemn events of the Chris- tian year in Santa F. She was a little wooden figure, about three feet high, very stately in bearing, with a beautiful though rather severe Spanish face. She had a rich wardrobe; a chest full of robes and laces, and gold and silver diadems. The women loved to sew for her and the silversmiths to make her chains and brooches. Father Latour had delighted her wardrobe keepers when he told them he did not believe the Queen of England or the Empress of France had so many costumes. She was their doll and their queen, something to fondle and something to adore, as Marys Son must have been to Her. These poor Mexicans, he reflected, were not the first to pour out their love in this simple fashion. Raphael and Titian had made costumes for Her in 258 GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK their time, and the great masters had made music for Her, and the great architects had built cathedrals for Her. Long before Her years on earth, in the long twilight between the Fall and the Redemption, the pagan sculptors were always trying to achieve the image of a goddess who should yet be a woman. Bishop Latours premonition was right: Father Vaillant never returned to share his work in New Mexico. Come back he did, to visit his old friends, whenever his busy life permitted. But his destiny was fulfilled in the cold, steely Colorado Rockies, which he never loved as he did the blue mountains of the South. He came back to Santa F to recuperate from the illnesses and accidents which consistently punctuated his way; came with the Papal Emissary when Bishop Latour was made Archbishop; but",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,77,"his working life was spent among bleak mountains and comfortless mining camps, looking after lost sheep. Creede, Durango, Silver City, Central City, over the Continental Divide into Utah, his strange Episcopal carriage was known throughout that rugged granite world. It was a covered carriage, on springs, and long enough for him to lie down in at night, Father Joseph was a very short man. At the back was a luggage box, which could be made into an altar when he celebrated Mass in the open, under a pine tree. 259 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP He used to say that the mountain torrents were the first road builders, and that wherever they found a way, he could find one. He wore out driver after driver, and his coach was repaired so often and so extensively that long before he abandoned it there was none of the original structure left. Broken tongues and singletrees, smashed wheels and splintered axles he considered trifling matters. Twice the old carriage itself slipped off the mountain road and rolled down the gorge, with the priest inside. From the first accident of this kind, Father Vaillant escaped with nothing worse than a sprain, and he wrote Bishop Latour that he attributed his preservation to the Archangel Raphael, whose office he had said with unusual fervour that morning. The second time he rolled down a ravine, near Central City, his thigh-bone was broken just below the joint. It knitted in time, but he was lamed for life, and could never ride horseback again. Before this accident befell him, however, he had one long visit among his friends in Santa F and Albuquerque, a renewal of old ties that was like an Indian summer in his life. When he left Denver, he told his congregation there that he was going to the Mexicans to beg for money. The church in Denver was under a roof, but the windows had been boarded up for months because nobody would buy glass for them. In his Denver congregation there were men 260 GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK who owned mines and saw-mills and flourishing businesses, but they needed all their money to push these enterprises. Down among the Mexicans, who owned nothing but a mud house and a burro, he could always raise money. If they had anything at all, they gave. He called this trip frankly a begging expedition, and he went in his carriage to bring back whatever he could gather. When he got as far as Taos, his Trish driver mutinied. Not another mile over these roads, he said. He knew his own territory, but here he refused to risk his neck and the Padres. There was then no wagon road from Taos to Santa F. It was nearly a fortnight before Father Vaillant found a man who would undertake to get him through the mountains. At last an old driver, schooled on the wagon trains, volunteered; and with the help of ax and pick and shovel, he brought the Epis- copal carriage safely to Santa F and into the Bishops courtyard. Once again among his own people, as he still called them, Father Joseph opened his campaign, and the poor Mexicans began taking dollars out of their shirts and boots (favourite places for carrying money) to pay for windows in the Denver church. His petitions did not stop with windows indeed, they only began there. He told the sympathetic women of Santa F and Albuquerque about all the 261 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP stupid, unnecessary discomforts of his life in Denver, discomforts that amounted to improprieties. It was a part of the Wild West attitude to despise the decencies of life. He told them how glad he was to sleep in good Mexican beds once more. In Denver he lay on a mattress stuffed with straw; a French priest who was visiting him had pulled out a long stem of hay that stuck through the thin ticking, and called it an American feather. His dining-table was made of planks covered with oilcloth. He had no linen at all, neither sheets nor serviettes, and he used his worn- out shirts for face towels. The Mexican women could scarcely bear to hear of such things. Nobody in Colorado planted gardens, Father Vaillant related; nobody would stick a shovel into the earth for any- thing less than gold. There was no butter, no milk, no eggs, no fruit. He lived on dough and cured hog meat. Within a few weeks after his arrival, six feather- beds were sent to the Bishops house for Father Vaillant; dozens of linen sheets, embroidered pillow- cases and table-cloths and napkins; strings of chili and boxes of beans and dried fruit. The little settle- ment of Chimayo sent a roll of their finest blankets. As",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,78,"these gifts arrived, Father Joseph put them in the woodhouse, knowing well that the Bishop was always embarrassed by his readiness to receive presents. But one morning Father Latour had oc- 262 GOLD UNDER PIKES PEAK casion to go into the woodhouse, and he saw for him- self. Father Joseph, he remonstrated, you will never be able to take all these things back to Denver. Why, you would need an ox-cart to carry them! Very well, replied Father Joseph, then God will send me an ox-cart. And He did, with a driver to take the cart as far as Pueblo. On the morning of his departure for home, when his carriage was ready, the cart covered with tar- paulins and the oxen yoked, Father Vaillant, who had been hurrying everyone since the first streak of light, suddenly became deliberate. He went into the Bishops study and sat down, talking to him of unimportant matters, lingering as if there were some- thing still undone. Well, we are getting older, Jean, he said ab- ruptly, after a short silence. The Bishop smiled. Ah, yes. We are not young men any more. One of these departures will be the last. Father Vaillant nodded. Whenever God wills. I am ready. He rose and began to pace the floor, addressing his friend without looking at him. But it has not been so bad, Jean? We have done the things we used to plan to do, long ago, when we were Seminarians, at least some of them. To fulfil the 263 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP dreams of ones youth; that is the best that can happen to a man. No worldly success can take the place of that. Blanchet, said the Bishop rising, you are a better man than I. You have been a great harvester of souls, without pride and without shame and I am always a little cold un pdant, as you used to say. If hereafter we have stars in our crowns, yours will be a constellation. Give me your blessing. He knelt, and Father Vaillant, having blessed him, knelt and was blessed in turn. They embraced each other for the past for the future. 264 BOOK NINE Pore tAHVCOMES: FOR THE eARCHBISHOP HEN that devout nun, Mother Superior Philo- mene, died at a great age in her native Riom, among her papers were found several letters from Archbishop Latour, one dated December 1888, only a few months before his death. Since your brother was called to his reward, he wrote, I feel nearer to him than before. For many years Duty separated us, but death has brought us together. The time 1s not far distant when I shall join him. Meanwhile, I am en- joying to the full that period of reflection which is the happiest conclusion to a life of action. This period of reflection the Archbishop spent on his little country estate, some four miles north of Santa F. Long before his retirement from the cares of the diocese, Father Latour bought those few acres in the red sand-hills near the Tesuque pueblo, and 265 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP set out an orchard which would be bearing when the time came for him to rest. He chose this place in the red hills spotted with juniper against the ad- vice of his friends, because he believed it to be ad- mirably suited for the growing of fruit. Once when he was riding out to visit the Tesuque mission, he had followed a stream and come upon this spot, where he found a little Mexican house and a garden shaded by an apricot tree of such great size as he had never seen before. It had two trunks, each of them thicker than a mans body, and though evidently very old, it was full of fruit. The apricots were large, beautifully coloured, and of superb flavour. Since this tree grew against the hillside, the Archbishop concluded that the exposure there must be excellent for fruit. He surmised that the heat of the sun, reflected from the rocky hill-slope up into the tree, gave the fruit an even temperature, warmth from two sides, such as brings the wall peaches to perfection in France. The old Mexican who lived there said the tree must be two hundred years old; it had been just like this when his grandfather was a boy, and had always borne luscious apricots like these. The old man would be glad to sell the place and move into Santa F, the Bishop found, and he bought it a few weeks later. In the spring he set out his orchard and a few rows of acacia trees. Some years afterward he built a little 266 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP adobe house, with a chapel, high up on",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,79,"the hill-side overlooking the orchard. Thither he used to go for rest and at seasons of special devotion. After his retirement, he went there to live, though he always kept his study unchanged in the house of the new Archbishop. In his retirement Father Latours principal work was the training of the new missionary priests who arrived from France. His successor, the second Archbishop, was also an Auvergnat, from Father Latours own college, and the clergy of northern New Mexico remained predominantly French. When a company of new priests arrived (they never came singly) Archbishop S sent them out to stay with Father Latour for a few months, to receive instruction in Spanish, in the topography of the dio- cese, in the character and traditions of the different pueblos. Father Latours recreation was his garden. He grew such fruit as was hardly to be found even in the old orchards of California; cherries and apricots, apples and quinces, and the peerless pears of France even the most delicate varieties. He urged the new priests to plant fruit trees wherever they went, and to encourage the Mexicans to add fruit to their starchy diet. Wherever there was a French priest, there should be a garden of fruit trees and vegetables 267 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP and flowers. He often quoted to his students that passage from their fellow Auvergnat, Pascal: that Man was lost and saved in a garden. He domesticated and developed the native wild flowers. He had one hill-side solidly clad with that low-growing purple verbena which mats over the hills of New Mexico. It was like a great violet velvet mantle thrown down in the sun; all the shades that the dyers and weavers of Italy and France strove for through centuries, the violet that is full of rose colour and is yet not lavender; the blue that be- comes almost pink and then retreats again into sea-dark purple the true Episcopal colour and countless variations of it. In the year 1885 there came to New Mexico a young Seminarian, Bernard Ducrot, who became like a son to Father Latour. The story of the old Arch- bishops life, often told in the cloisters and class-rooms at Montferrand, had taken hold of this boys imagi- nation, and he had long waited an opportunity to come. Bernard was handsome in person and of unusual mentality, had in himself the fineness to reverence all that was fine inhis venerable Superior. He anticipated Father Latours every wish, shared his reflections, cherished his reminiscences. Surely, the Bishop used to say to the priests, God himself has sent me this young man to help me through the last years. 268 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP T snovexovt the autumn of the year 88 the Bishop was in good health. He had five French priests in his house, and he still rode abroad with them to visit the nearer missions. On Christmas eve, he performed the midnight Mass in the Cathedral at Santa F. In January he drove with Bernard to Santa Cruz to see the resident priest, who was ill. While they were on their way home the weather sud- denly changed, and a violent rain-storm overtook them. They were in an open buggy and were drenched to the skin before they could reach any Mexican house for shelter. After arriving home, Father Latour went at once to bed. During the night he slept badly and felt feverish. He called none of his household, but arose at the usual hour before dawn and went into the chapel for his devotions. While he was at prayer, he was seized with a chill. He made his way to the kitchen, and his old cook, Fructosa, alarmed at once, put him to bed and gave him brandy. This chill left him feverish, and he developed a distressing cough. After keeping quietly to his bed for a few days, the Bishop called young Bernard to him one morning and said: 269 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Bernard, will you ride into Santa F to-day and see the Archbishop for me. Ask him whether it will be quite convenient if I return to occupy my study in his house for a short time. Je voudrais mou- rir & Santa F. T will go at once, Father. But you should not be discouraged; one does not die of a cold. , The old man smiled. I shall not die of a cold, my son. I shall die of having lived. From that moment on, he spoke only French to those about him, and this sudden relaxing of his rule alarmed his household more than anything else about his condition. When a priest had received bad news from home, or was ill, Father Latour would converse with him in his",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,80,"own language; but at other times he required that all conversation in his house should be in Spanish or English. Bernard returned that afternoon to say that the Archbishop would be delighted if Father Latour would remain the rest of the winter with him. Magdalena had already begun to air his study and put it in order, and she would be in special attend- ance upon him during his visit. The Archbishop would send his new carriage to fetch him, as Father Latour had only an open buggy. Not to-day, mon fils, said the Bishop. We will choose a day when I am feeling stronger; a fair day, when we can go in my own buggy, and you can 270 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP drive me. I wish to go late in the afternoon, toward : sunset. Bernard understood. He knew that once, long ago, at that hour of the day, a young Bishop had ridden along the Albuquerque road and seen Santa F for the first time. . . And often, when they were driving into town together, the Bishop had paused with Bernard on that hill-top from which Father Vaillant had looked back on Santa F, when he went away to Colorado to begin the work that had taken the rest of his life and made him, too, a Bishop in the end. The old town was better to look at in those days, Father Latour used to tell Bernard with a sigh. In the old days it had an individuality, a style of its own; a tawny adobe town with a few green trees, set in a half-circle of carnelian-coloured hills; that and no more. But the year 1880 had begun a period of incongruous American building. Now, half the plaza square was still adobe, and half was flimsy wooden buildings with double porches, scroll-work and jack- straw posts and banisters painted white. Father Latour said the wooden houses which had so dis- tressed him in Ohio, had followed him. All this was quite wrong for the Cathedral he had been so many years in building, the Cathedral that had taken Father Vaillants place in his life after that re- markable man went away. 25% DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Father Latour made his last entry into Santa F at the end of a brilliant February afternoon; Ber- nard stopped the horses at the foot of the long street to await the sunset. Wrapped in his Indian blankets, the old Arch- bishop sat for a long while, looking at the open, golden face of his Cathedral. How exactly young Molny, his French architect, had done what he wanted! Nothing sensational, simply honest build- ing and good stone-cutting, good Midi Roman- esque of the plainest. And even now, in winter, when the acacia trees before the door were bare, how it was of the South, that church, how it sounded the note of the South! No one but Molny and the Bishop had ever seemed to enjoy the beautiful site of that building, per- haps no one ever would. But these two had spent many an hour admiring it. The steep carnelian hills drew up so close behind the church that the individ- ual pine trees thinly wooding their slopes were clearly visible. From the end of the street where the Bishops buggy stood, the tawny church seemed to start directly out of those rose-coloured hills with a purpose so strong that it was like action. Seen from this distance, the Cathedral lay against the pine- splashed slopes as against a curtain. When Bernard drove slowly nearer, the backbone of the hills sank gradually, and the towers rose clear into the blue 272 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP air, while the body of the church stili lay against the : mountain. The young architect used to tell the Bishop that only in Italy, or in the opera, did churches leap out of mountains and black pines like that. More than once Molny had called the Bishop from his study to look at the unfinished building when a storm was coming up; then the sky above the mountain grew black, and the carnelian rocks became an intense lavender, all their pine trees strokes of dark purple; the hills drew nearer, the whole background approached like a dark threat. Setting, Molny used to tell Father Latour, is accident. Either a building is a part of a place, or it is not. Once that kinship is there, time will only make it stronger. The Bishop was recalling this saying of Molnys when a voice out of the present sounded in his ear. It was Bernard. A fine sunset, Father. See how red the mountains are growing; Sangre de Cristo. Yes, Sangre de Cristo; but no matter how scarlet the sunset,",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,81,"those red hills never became vermilion, but a more and more intense rose-carnelian; not the colour of living blood, the Bishop had often reflected, but the colour of the dried blood of saints and mar- tyrs preserved in old churches in Rome, which liquefies upon occasion. 273 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Te next morning Father Latour wakened with a grateful sense of nearness to his Cathedral which would also be his tomb. He felt safe under its shadow; like a boat come back to harbour, lying under its own sea-wall. He was in his old study; the Sisters had sent a little iron bed from the school for him, and their finest linen and blankets. He felt a great content at being here, where he had come as a young man and where he had done his work. The room was little changed; the same rugs and skins on the earth floor, the same desk with his candlesticks, the same thick, wavy white walls that muted sound, that shut out the world and gave repose to the spirit. As the darkness faded into the grey of a winter morning, he listened for the church bells, and for another sound, that always amused him here; the whistle of a locomotive. Yes, he had come with the buffalo, and he had lived to see railway trains run- ning into Santa F. He had accomplished an his- toric period. All his relatives at home, and his friends in New Mexico, had expected that the old Archbishop would spend his closing years in France, probably in Cler- mont, where he could occupy a chair in his old 274 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP college. That seemed the natural thing to do, and he had given it grave consideration. He had half ex- pected to make some such arrangement the last time he was in Auvergne, just before his retirement from his duties as Archbishop. But in the Old World he found himself homesick for the New. It was a feeling he could not explain; a feeling that old age did not weigh so heavily upon a man in New Mexico as in the Puy-de-Dm. He loved the towering peaks of his native moun- tains, the comeliness of the villages, the cleanness of the country-side, the beautiful lines and the cloisters of his own college. Clermont was beautiful, but he found himself sad there; his heart lay like a stone in his breast. There was too much past, perhaps... When the summer wind stirred the lilacs in the old gardens and shook down the blooms of the horse- chestnuts, he sometimes closed his eyes and thought of the high song the wind was singing in the straight, striped pine trees up in the Navajo forests. During the day his nostalgia wore off, and by din- ner-time it was quite gone. He enjoyed his dinner and his wine, and the company of cultivated men, and usually retired in good spirits. It was in the early morning that he felt the ache in his breast; it had something to do with waking in the early morn- ing. It seemed to him that the grey dawn lasted so long here, the country was a long while in coming to 275 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP life. The gardens and the fields were damp, heavy mists hung in the valley and obscured the mountains; hours went by before the sun could disperse those vapours and warm and purify the villages. In New Mexico he always awoke a young man; not until he rose and began to shave did he realize that he was growing older. His first consciousness was a sense of the light dry wind blowing in through the windows, with the fragrance of hot sun and sage- brush and sweet clover; a wind that made ones body feel light and ones heart cry To-day, to-day, like a childs. Beautiful surroundings, the society of learned men, the charm of noble women, the graces of art, could not make up to him for the loss of those light-hearted mornings of the desert, for that wind that made one a boy again. He had noticed that this peculiar quality in the air of new countries vanished after they were tamed by man and made to bear harvests. Parts of Texas and Kansas that he had first known as open range had since been made into rich farming districts, and the air had quite lost that lightness, that dry aromatic odour. The moisture of plowed land, the heaviness of labour and growth and grain-bearing, utterly destroyed it; one could breathe that only on the bright edges of the world, on the great grass plains or the sage-brush desert. That air would disappear from the whole earth 276 DEATH COMES FOR",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,82,"THE ARCHBISHOP in time, perhaps; but long after his day. He did not know just when it had become so necessary to him, but he had come back to die in exile for the sake of it. Something soft and wild and free, something that whispered to the ear on the pillow, lightened the heart, softly, softly picked the lock, slid the bolts, and released the prisoned spirit of man into the wind, into the blue and gold, into the morning, into the morning! F ATHER LATOUR arranged an order for his last days; if routine was necessary to him in health, it was even more so in sickness. Early in the morning Bernard came with hot water, shaved him, and helped him to bathe. They had brought nothing in from the country with them but clothing and linen, and the silver toilet articles the Olivares had given the Bishop so long ago; these thirty years he had washed his hands in that hammered basin. Morning prayers over, Magdalena came with his breakfast, and he sat in his easy-chair while she made his bed and arranged his room. Then he was ready to see visitors. 277 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP The Archbishop came in for a few moments, when he was at home; the Mother Superior, the American doctor. Bernard read aloud to him the rest of the morning; St. Augustine, or the letters of Madame de Sevign, or his favourite Pascal. Sometimes, in the morning hours, he dictated to his young disciple certain facts about the old missions in the diocese; facts which he had come upon by chance and feared would be forgotten. He wished he could do this systematically, but he had not the strength. Those truths and fancies relating to a bygone time would probably be lost; the old legends and customs and superstitions were already dying out. He wished now that long ago he had had the leisure to write them down, that he could have arrested their flight by throwing about them the light and elastic mesh of the French tongue. He had, indeed, for years, directed the thoughts of the young priests whom he instructed to the forti- tude and devotion of those first missionaries, the Spanish friars; declaring that his own life, when he first came to New Mexico, was one of ease and com- fort compared with theirs. If he had used to be abroad for weeks together on short rations, sleeping in the open, unable to keep his body clean, at least he had the sense of being in a friendly world, where by every mans fireside a welcome awaited him. But the Spanish Fathers who came up to Zufi, 278 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP then went north to the Navajos, west to the Hopis, east to all the pueblos scattered between Albuquer- que and Taos, they came into a hostile country, carrying little provisionment but their breviary and crucifix. When their mules were stolen by Indians, as often happened, they proceeded on foot, without a change of raiment, without food or water. A Euro- pean could scarcely imagine such hardships. The old countries were worn to the shape of human life, made into an investiture, a sort of second body, for man. There the wild herbs and the wild fruits and the forest fungi were edible. The streams were sweet water, the trees afforded shade and shelter. But in the alkali deserts the water holes were poisonous, and the vegetation offered nothing to a starving man. Everything was dry, prickly, sharp; Spanish bayonet, juniper, greasewood, cactus; the lizard, the rattle- snake, and man made cruel by a cruel life. Those early missionaries threw themselves naked upon the hard heart of a country that was calculated to try the endurance of giants. They thirsted in its deserts, starved among its rocks, climbed up and down its terrible canyons on stone-bruised feet, broke long fasts by unclean and repugnant food. Surely these endured Hunger, Thirst, Cold, Nakedness, of a kind beyond any conception St. Paul and his brethren could have had. Whatever the early Christians suffered, it all happened in that safe little Medi- 279 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP terranean world, amid the old manners, the old landmarks. If they endured martyrdom, they died among their brethren, their relics were piously pre- served, their names lived in the mouths of holy men. Riding with his Auvergnats to the old missions that had been scenes of martyrdom, the Bishop used to remind them that no man could know what triumphs of faith had happened there, where one white man met torture and death alone among so many infidels, or what visions and revelations God may have granted to soften that brutal end. When, as a young man, Father Latour",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,83,"first went down into Old Mexico, to claim his See at the hands of the Bishop of Durango, he had met on his journey priests from the missions of Sonora and Lower Cali- fornia, who related many stories of the blessed ex- periences of the early Franciscan missionaries. Their way through the wilderness had blossomed with little miracles, it seemed. At one time, when the renowned Father Junfpero Serra, and his two companions, were in danger of their lives from trying to cross a river at a treacherous point, a mysterious stranger appeared out of the rocks on the opposite shore, and calling to them in Spanish, told them to follow him to a point farther up the stream, where they forded in safety. When they begged to know his name, he evaded them and disappeared. At another time, they were traversing a great plain, and 280 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP were famished for water and almost spent; a young horseman overtook them and gave them three ripe pomegranates, then galloped away. This fruit not only quenched their thirst, but revived and strength- ened them as much as the most nourishing food could have done, and they completed their journey like fresh men. One night in his travels through Durango, Father Latour was entertained at a great country estate where the resident chaplain happened to be a priest from one of the western missions; and he told a story of this same Father Junipero which had come down in his own monastery from the old times. Father Junfpero, he said, with a single compan- ion, had once arrived at his monastery on foot, without provisions. The Brothers had welcomed the two in astonishment, believing it impossible that men could have crossed so great a stretch of desert in this naked fashion. The Superior questioned them as to whence they had come, and said the mission should not have allowed them to set off without a guide and without food. He marvelled how they could have got through alive. But Father Junfpero replied that they had fared very well, and had been most agreeably entertained by a poor Mexican family on the way. At this a muleteer, who was bringing in wood for the Brothers, began to laugh, and said there was no house for twelve leagues, nor 281 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP anyone at all living in the sandy waste through which they had come; and the Brothers confirmed him in this. Then Father Junfpero and his companion related fully their adventure. They had set out with bread and water for one day. But on the second day they had been travelling since dawn across a cactus desert and had begun to lose heart when, near sunset, they espied in the distance three great cottonwood trees, very tall in the declining light. Toward these they hastened. As they approached the trees, which were large and green and were shedding cotton freely, they observed an ass tied to a dead trunk which stuck up out of the sand. Looking about for the owner of the ass, they came upon a little Mexican house with an oven by the door and strings of red peppers hanging on the wall. When they called aloud, a venera- ble Mexican, clad in sheepskins, came out and greeted them kindly, asking them to stay the night. Going in with him, they observed that all was neat and comely, and the wife, a young woman of beautiful countenance, was stirring porridge by the fire. Her child, scarcely more than an infant and with no garment but his little shirt, was on the floor beside her, playing with a pet lamb. They found these people gentle, pious, and well- spoken. The husband said they were shepherds. The priests sat at their table and shared their supper, and 282 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP afterward read the evening prayers. They had wished to question the host about the country, and about his mode of life and where he found pasture for his flock, but they were overcome by a great and sweet weari- ness, and taking each a sheepskin provided him, they lay down upon the floor and sank into deep sleep. When they awoke in the morning they found all as before, and food set upon the table, but the family were absent, even to the pet lamb, having gone, the Fathers supposed, to care for their flock. When the Brothers at the monastery heard this account they were amazed, declaring that there were indeed three cottonwood trees growing to- gether in the desert, a well-known landmark; but that if a settler had come, he must have come very lately. So Father Junfpero and Father Andrea, his companion, with some of the Brothers and the scofang",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,84,"muleteer, went back into the wilderness to prove the matter. The three tall trees they found, shedding their cotton, and the dead trunk to which the ass had been tied. But the ass was not there, nor any house, nor the oven by the door. Then the two Fathers sank down upon their knees in that blessed spot and kissed the earth, for they perceived what Family it was that had entertained them there. Father Junfpero confessed to the Brothers how from the moment he entered the house he had been strangely drawn to the child, and desired to take him 283 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in his arms, but that he kept near his mother. When the priest was reading the evening prayers the child sat upon the floor against his mothers knee, with the lamb in his lap, and the Father found it hard to keep his eyes upon his breviary. After prayers, when he bade his hosts good-night, he did indeed stoop over the little boy in blessing; and the child had lifted his hand, and with his tiny finger made the cross upon Father Junfperos forehead. This story of Father Juniperos Holy Family made a strong impression upon the Bishop, when it was told him by the fireside of that great hacienda where he was a guest for the night. He had such an affection for that story, indeed, that he had allowed himself to repeat it on but two occasions; once to the nuns of Mother Philomnes convent in Riom, and once at a dinner given by Cardinal Mazzucchi, in Rome. There is always something charming in the idea of greatness returning to simplicity the queen making hay among the country girls but how much more endearing was the belief that They, after so many centuries of history and glory, should return to play Their first parts, in the persons of a humble Mexican family, the lowliest of the lowly, the poorest of the poor, in a wilderness at the end of the world, where the angels could scarcely find Them! 284 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Arr his djeuner the old Archbishop made a pretence of sleeping. He requested not to be dis- turbed until dinner-time, and those long hours of solitude were precious to him. His bed was at the dark end of the room, where the shadows were rest- ful to his eyes; on fair days the other end was full of sunlight, on grey days the light of the fire flickered along the wavy white walls. Lying so still that the bed-clothes over his body scarcely moved, with his hands resting delicately on the sheet beside him or upon his breast, the Bishop was living over his life. When he was otherwise motionless, the thumb of his right hand would sometimes gently touch a ring on his forefinger, an amethyst with an inscription cut upon it, Auspice Maria, Father Vaillants signet- ring; and then he was almost certainly thinking of Joseph; of their life together here, in this room... in Ohio beside the Great Lakes ... as young men in Paris ... as boys at Montferrand. There were many passages in their missionary life that he loved to recall; and how often and how fondly he recalled the beginning of it! They were both young men in their twenties, curates to older priests, when there came to Clermont 285 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP a Bishop from Ohio, a native of Auvergne, looking for volunteers for his missions in the West. Father Jean and Father Joseph heard him lecture at the Seminary, and talked with him in private. Before he left for the North, they had pledged themselves to meet him in Paris at a given date, to spend some weeks of preparation at the College for Foreign Missions in the rue du Bac, and then to sail with him from Cherbourg. Both the young priests knew that their families would strongly oppose their purpose, so they resolved to reveal it to no one; to make no adieux, but to steal away disguised in civilians clothes. They comforted each other by recalling that St. Francis Xavier, when he set forth as missionary to India, had stolen away like this; had passed the dwelling of his parents without saluting them, as they had learned at school; terrible words to a French boy. Father Vaillants position was especially painful; his father was a stern, silent man, long a widower, who loved his children with a jealous passion and had no life but in their lives. Joseph was the eldest child. The period between his resolve and its execu- tion was a period of anguish for him. As the date set for their departure drew near, he grew thinner and paler than ever.",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,85,"By agreement the two friends were to meet at dawn in a certain field outside Riom on the fateful 286 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP day, and there await the diligence for Paris. Jean Latour, having made his decision and pledged him- self, knew no wavering. On the appointed morning he stole out of his sisters house and took his way through the sleeping town to that mountain field, tip- tilted by reason of its steepness, just beginning to show a cold green in the heavy light of a cloudy day-break. There he found his comrade in a miserable plight. Joseph had been abroad in the fields all night, wandering up and down, finding his purpose and losing it. His face was swollen with weeping. He chill, his voice was beyond his shook with a control. What shall I do, Jean? Help me! he cried. I cannot break my fathers heart, and I cannot break the vow I have made to Heaven. I had rather die than do either. Ah, if I could but die of this misery, here, now! How clearly the old Archbishop could recall the scene; those two young men in the fields in the grey morning, disguised as if they were criminals, es- caping by stealth from their homes. He had not known how to comfort his friend; it seemed to him that Joseph was suffering more than flesh could bear, that he was actually being torn in two by conflicting desires. While they were pacing up and down, arm-in-arm, they heard a hollow sound; the diligence rumbling down the mountain gorge. Joseph 287 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP stood still and buried his face in his hands. The pos- tilions horn sounded. Allons! said Jean lightly. Linvitation du voyage! You will accompany me to Paris. Once we are there, if your father is not reconciled, we will get Bishop F to absolve you from your promise, and you can return to Riom. It is very simple. He ran to the road-side and waved to the driver; the coach stopped. In a moment they were off, and before long Joseph had fallen asleep in his seat from sheer exhaustion. But he always said that if Jean Latour had not supported him in that hour of tor- ment, he would have been a parish priest in the Puy de Dom for the rest of his life. Of the two young priests who set forth from Riom that morning in early spring, Jean Latour had seemed the one so much more likely to succeed in a mission- arys life. He, indeed, had a sound mind in a sound body. During the weeks they spent at the College of Foreign Missions in the rue du Bac, the authorities had been very doubtful of Josephs fitness for the hardships of the mission field. Yet in the long test of years it was that frail body that had endured more and accomplished more. Father Latour often said that his diocese changed little except in boundaries. The Mexicans were always Mexicans, the Indians were always Indians. Santa F was a quiet backwater, with no natural wealth, no 288 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP importance commercially. But Father Vaillant had been plunged into the midst of a great industrial expansion, where guile and trickery and honourable ambition all struggled together; a territory that devel- oped by leaps and bounds and then experienced ruin- ous reverses. Every year, even after he was crippled, he travelled thousands of miles by stage and in his carriage, among the mountain towns that were now rich, now poor and deserted; Boulder, Gold Hill, Caribou, Cache-a-la-Poudre, Spanish Bar, South Park, up the Arkansas to Cache Creek and Cali- fornia Gulch. And Father Vaillant had not been content to be a mere missionary priest. He became a promoter. He saw a great future for the Church in Colorado. While he was still so poor that he could not have a rectory of ordinary comfort to live in, he began buying up great tracts of land for the Church. He was able to buy a great deal of land for very little money, but that little had to be borrowed from banks ata ruinous rate of interest. He borrowed money to build schools and convents, and the interest on his debts ate him up. He made long begging trips through Ohio and Pennsylvania and Canada to raise money to pay this interest, which grew like a rolling snowball. He formed a land company, went abroad and floated bonds in France to raise money, and dishonest brokers brought reproach upon his name. 289 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP When he was nearly seventy, with one leg four inches shorter than the other, Father Vaillant, then first Bishop of Colorado, was summoned to",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,86,"Rome to explain his complicated finance before the Papal court, and he had very hard work to satisfy the Cardinals. When a dispatch was flashed into Santa F an- nouncing Bishop Vaillants death, Father Latour at once took the new railroad for Denver. But he could scarcely believe the telegram. He recalled the old nickname, Trompe-la-Mort, and remembered how many times before he had hurried across moun- tains and deserts, not daring to hope he would find his friend alive. Curiously, Father Latour could never feel that he had actually been present at Father Josephs funeral or rather, he could not believe that Father Joseph was there. The shrivelled little old man in the coffin, scarcely larger than a monkey that had nothing to do with Father Vaillant. He could see Joseph as clearly as he could see Bernard, but always as he was when they first came to New Mexico. It was not sentiment; that was the picture of Father Joseph his memory produced for him, and it did not produce any other. The funeral itself, he liked to remember as a recognition. It was held under canvas, in the open air; there was not a building in Denver 290 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in the whole Far West, for that matter, big enough for his Blanchets funeral. For two days before, the populations of villages and mining camps had been streaming down the mountains; they slept in wagons and tents and barns; they made a throng like a National Convention in the convent square. And a strange thing happened at that funeral: Father Revardy, the French priest who had gone from Santa F to Colorado with Father Vaillant more than twenty years before, and had been with him ever since as his curate and Vicar, had been sent to France on business for his Bishop. While there, he was told by his physician that he had a fatal malady, and he at once took ship and hurried homeward, to make his report to Bishop Vaillant and to die in the harness. When he got as far as Chicago, he had an acute seizure and was taken to a Catholic hospital, where he lay very ill. One morning a nurse happened to leave a newspaper near his bed; glancing at it, Father Revardy saw an announce- ment of the death of the Bishop of Colorado. When the Sister returned, she found her patient dressed. He convinced her that he must be driven to the railway station at once. On reaching Denver he entered a carriage and asked to be taken to the Bishops funeral. He arrived there when the services were nearly half over, and no one ever forgot the sight of this dying man, supported by the cab-driver and 291 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP two priests, making his way through the crowd and dropping upon his knees beside the bier. A chair was brought for him, and for the rest of the ceremony he sat with his forehead resting against the edge of the coffin. When Bishop Vaillant was carried away to his tomb, Father Revardy was taken to the hos- pital, where he died a few days later. It was one more instance of the extraordinary personal devotion that Father Joseph had so often aroused and re- tained so long, in red men and yellow men and white. D URING those last weeks of the Bishops life he thought very little about death; it was the Past he was leaving. The future would take care of itself. But he had an intellectual curiosity about dying; about the changes that took place in a mans be- liefs and scale of values. More and more life seemed to him an experience of the Ego, in no sense the Ego itself. This conviction, he believed, was something apart from his religious life; it was an enlightenment that came to him as a man, a human creature. And he noticed that he judged conduct differently - now; his own and that of others. The mistakes of 292 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP his life seemed unimportant; accidents that had occurred en route, like the shipwreck in Galveston harbour, or the runaway in which he was hurt when he was first on his way to New Mexico in search of his Bishopric. He observed also that there was no longer any perspective in his memories. He remembered his winters with his cousins on the Mediterranean when he was a little boy, his student days in the Holy City, as clearly as he remembered the arrival of M. Molny and the building of his Cathedral. He was soon to have done with calendared time, and it had already ceased to count for him. He sat in the middle of his own",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
death comes for the archbishop,87,"consciousness; none of his former states of mind were lost or outgrown. They were all within reach of his hand, and all comprehensible. Sometimes, when Magdalena or Bernard came in and asked him a question, it took him several seconds to bring himself back to the present. He could see they thought his mind was failing; but it was only extraordinarily active in some other part of the great picture of his life some part of which they knew nothing. When the occasion warranted he could return to the present. But there was not much present left; Father Joseph dead, the Olivares both dead, Kit Carson dead, only the minor characters of his life remained in present time. One morning, several weeks 293 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP after the Bishop came back to Santa F, one of the strong people of the old deep days of life did appear, not in memory but in the flesh, in the shallow light of the present; Eusabio the Navajo. Out on the Colorado Chiquito he had heard the word, passed on from one trading post to another, that the old Archbishop was failing, and the Indian came to Santa F. He, too, was an old man now. Once again their fine hands clasped. The Bishop brushed a drop of moisture from his eye. T have wished for this meeting, my friend. I had thought of asking you to come, but it is a long way. The old Navajo smiled. Not long now, any more. I come on the cars, Padre. I get on the cars at Gallup, and the same day I am here. You remember when we come together once to Santa F from my country? How long it take us? Two weeks, pretty near. Men travel faster now, but I do not know if they go to better things. We must not try to Poe the future, Eusabio. It is better not. And Manuelito? Manuelito is well; he still leads his people. Eusabio did not stay long, but he said he would come again to-morrow, as he had business in Santa F that would keep him for some days. He had no business there; but when he looked at Father Latour . he said to himself, It will not be long. 204 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP After he was gone, the Bishop turned to Bernard : My son, I have lived to see two great wrongs righted; I have seen the end of black slavery, and I have seen the Navajos restored to their own coun- ry For many years Father Latour used to wonder if there would ever be an end to the Indian wars while there was one Navajo or Apache left alive. Too many traders and manufacturers made a rich profit out of that warfare; a political machine and immense capital were employed to keep it going. oss Bishops middle years in New Mexico had been clouded by the persecution of the Navajos and their expulsion from their own country. Through his friendship with Eusabio he had become interested in the Navajos soon after he first came to his new dio- cese, and he admired them; they stirred his imagi- nation. Though this nomad people were much slower to adopt white mans ways than the home- staying Indians who dwelt in pueblos, and were much more indifferent to missionaries and the white mans religion, Father Latour felt a superior strength 295 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in them. There was purpose and conviction behind their inscrutable reserve; something active and quick, something with an edge. The expulsion of the Navajos from their country, which had been theirs no man knew how long, had seemed to him an injustice that cried to Heaven. Never could he forget that terrible winter when they were being hunted down and driven by thousands from their own reservation to the Bosque Redondo, three hundred miles away on the Pecos River. Hundreds of them, men, women, and children, perished from hunger and cold on the way; their sheep and horses died from exhaustion crossing the mountains. None ever went willingly; they were driven by starvation and the bayonet; captured in isolated bands, and brutally deported. It was his own misguided friend, Kit Carson, who finally subdued the last unconquered remnant of that people; who followed them into the depths of the Canyon de Chelly, whither they had fled from their grazing plains and pine forests to make their last stand. They were shepherds, with no property but their live-stock, encumbered by their women and children, poorly armed and with scanty ammu- nition. But this canyon had always before proved impenetrable to white troops. The Navajos believed it could not be taken. They believed that their old gods dwelt in the fastnesses of",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,88,"that canyon; like 296 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP their Shiprock, it was an inviolate place, the very heart and centre of their life. Carson followed them down into the hidden world between those towering walls of red sandstone, spoiled their stores, destroyed their deep-sheltered corn-fields, cut down the terraced peach orchards so dear to them. When they saw all that was sacred to them laid waste, the Navajos lost heart. They did not surrender; they simply ceased to fight, and were taken. Carson was a soldier under orders, and he did a soldiers brutal work. But the bravest of the Navajo chiefs he did not capture. Even after the crushing defeat of his people in the Canyon de Chelly, Manuelito was still at large. It was then that Eu- sabio came to Santa F to ask Bishop Latour to meet Manuelito at Zufi. As a priest, the Bishop knew that it was indiscreet to consent to a meeting with this outlawed chief; but he was a man, too, and a lover of justice. The request came to him in such a way that he could not refuse it. He went with Eusabio. Though the Government was offering a heavy re- ward for his person, living or dead, Manuelito rode off his own reservation down into Zufii in broad day- light, attended by some dozen followers, all on wretched, half-starved horses. He had been in hiding out in Eusabios country on the Colorado Chiquito. It was Manuelitos hope that the Bishop would 297 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP go to Washington and plead his peoples cause before they were utterly destroyed. They asked nothing of the Government, he told Father Latour, religion, and their own land where but their they had lived from immemorial times. Their coun- try, he explained, was a part of their religion; the two were inseparable. The Canyon de Chelly the Padre knew; in that canyon his people had lived when they were a small weak tribe; it had nourished and protected them; it was their mother. Moreover, their gods dwelt there in those inaccessible white houses set in caverns up in the face of the cliffs, which were older than the white mans world, and which no living man had ever entered. Their gods were there, just as the Padres God was in his church. And north of the Canyon de Chelly was the Shiprock, a slender crag rising to a dizzy height, all alone out on a flat desert. Seen at a distance of fifty miles or so, that crag presents the figure of a one-masted fishing-boat under full sail, and the white man named it accordingly. But the Indian has another name; he believes that rock was once a ship of the air. Ages ago, Manuelito told the Bishop, that crag had moved through the air, bearing upon its summit the parents of the Navajo race from the place in the far north where all peoples were made, and wherever it sank to earth was to be their land. It sank in a desert country, where it 20908 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP was hard for men to live. But they had found the Canyon de Chelly, where there was shelter and un- failing water. That canyon and the Shiprock were like kind parents to his people, places more sacred to them than churches, more sacred than any place is to the white man. How, then, could they go three hundred miles away and live in a strange land? Moreover, the Bosque Redondo was down on the Pecos, far east of the Rio Grande. Manuelito drew a map in the sand, and explained to the Bishop how, from the very beginning, it had been enjoined that his people must never cross the Rio Grande on the east, or the Rio San Juan on the north, or the Rio Colorado on the west; if they did, the tribe would perish. If a great priest, like Father Latour, were to go to Washington and explain these things, perhaps the Government would listen. Father Latour tried to tell the Indian that in a Protestant country the one thing a Roman priest could not do was to interfere in matters of Govern- respectfully, but the ment. Manuelito listened Bishop saw that he did not believe him. When he had finished, the Navajo rose and said: Vou are the friend of Cristobal, who hunts my people and drives them over the mountains to the Bosque Redondo. Tell your friend that he will never take me alive. He can come and kill me when he pleases. Two years ago I could not count my flocks; 299 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP now I have thirty sheep and a few starving horses. My children are eating roots, and I do",no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,89,"not care for my life. But my mother and my gods are in the West, and I will never cross the Rio Grande. He never did cross it. He lived in hiding until the return of his exiled people. For an unforeseen thing happened: The Bosque Redondo proved an utterly unsuitable country for the Navajos. It could have been farmed by irrigation, but they were nomad shepherds, not farmers. There was no pasture for their flocks. There was no firewood; they dug mesquite roots and dried them for fuel. It was an alkaline country, and hun- dreds of Indians died from bad water. At last the Government at Washington admitted its mistake which governments seldom do. After five years of exile, the remnant of the Navajo people were per- mitted to go back to their sacred places. In 1875 the Bishop took his French architect on a pack trip into Arizona to show him something of the country before he returned to France, and he had the pleasure of seeing the Navajo horsemen riding free over their great plains again. The two Frenchmen went as far as the Canyon de Chelly to behold the strange cliff ruins; once more crops were growing down at the bottom of the world between the towering sandstone walls; sheep were grazing under | the magnificent cottonwoods and drinking at the 300 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP streams of sweet water; it was like an Indian Garden of Eden. Now, when he was an old man and ill, scenes from those bygone times, dark and bright, flashed back to the Bishop: the terrible faces of the Navajos waiting at the place on the Rio Grande where they were being ferried across into exile; the long streams of survivors going back to their own country, driving their scanty flocks, carrying their old men and their children. Memories, too, of that time he had spent with Eusabio on the Little Colorado, in the early spring, when the lambing season was not yet over, dark horsemen riding across the sands with orphan lambs in their armsa young Navajo woman, giving a lamb her breast until a ewe was found for it. Bernard, the old Bishop would murmur, God has been very good to let me live to see a happy issue to those old wrongs. I do not believe, as I once did, that the Indian will perish. I believe that God will preserve him. 301 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP Tx American doctor was consulting with Arch- bishop S and the Mother Superior. It is his heart that is the trouble now. I have been giving him small doses to stimulate it, but they no longer have any effect. I scarcely dare increase them; it might be fatal at once. But that is why you see such a change in him. The change was that the old man did not want food, and that he slept, or seemed to sleep, nearly all the time. On the last day of his life his condition was pretty generally known. The Cathedral was full of people all day long, praying for him; nuns and old _ women, young men and girls, coming and going. The sick man had received the Viaticum early in the morning. Some of the Tesuque Indians, who had been his country neighbours, came into Santa F and sat all day in the Archbishops courtyard listening for news of him; with them was Eusabio the Navajo. Fructosa and Tranquilino, his old servants, were with the supplicants in the Cathedral. The Mother Superior and Magdalena and Bernard attended the sick man. There was little to do but to watch and pray, so peaceful and painless was his re- pose. Sometimes it was sleep, they knew from his re- 302 DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP laxed features; then his face would assume person- ality, consciousness, even though his eyes did not open. Toward the close of day, in the short twilight after the candles were lighted, the old Bishop seemed to become restless, moved a little, and began to murmur; it was in the French tongue, but Bernard, though he caught some words, could make nothing of them. He knelt beside the bed: What is it, Father? I am here. He continued to murmur, to move his hands a little, and Magdalena thought he was trying to ask for something, or to tell them something. But in reality the Bishop was not there at all; he was stand- ing in a tip-tilted green field among his native moun- tains, and he was trying to give consolation to a young man who was being torn in two before his eyes by the desire to go and the necessity to stay. He was trying to forge a new Will in that",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
death comes for the archbishop,90,"devout and exhausted priest; and the time was short, for the diligence for Paris was already rumbling down the mountain gorge. When the Cathedral bell tolled just after dark, the Mexican population of Santa F fell upon their knees, and all American Catholics as well. Many others who did not kneel prayed in their hearts. Eusabio and the Tesuque boys went quietly away to tell their people; and the next morning the old Archbishop lay before the high altar in the church he had built. 323 A NOTE ON THE TYPE IN WHICH THIS BOOK IS SET This book is composed on the monotype in Old Style No. This face is largely based on a series originally cut 31. by the Bruce Foundry in the early seventies and that in its turn appears to have followed, in all essentials, the details of a face designed and cut, some years before, by the celebrated Edinburgh type founders, Miller and Richard. It has always been a popular and satisfactory face for book work because while it is compactly designed, so that a large number of words appear on a page, its compact- ness is not accompanied by any loss in legibility. Old Style No. 31, composed in a page gives a subdued color and even texture which makes it easily and comfortably read.

The Trial - Franz Kafka,0,"The Trial Franz Kafka Chapter One Arrest - Conversation with Mrs. Grubach - Then Miss Brstner Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K., he knew he had done nothing wrong but, one morning, he was arrested. Every day at eight in the morning he was brought his breakfast by Mrs. Grubach's cook - Mrs. Grubach was his landlady - but today she didn't come. That had never happened before. K. waited a little while, looked from his pillow at the old woman who lived opposite and who was watching him with an inquisitiveness quite unusual for her, and finally, both hungry and disconcerted, rang the bell. There was immediately a knock at the door and a man entered. He had never seen the man in this house before. He was slim but firmly built, his clothes were black and close-fitting, with many folds and pockets, buckles and buttons and a belt, all of which gave the impression of being very practical but without making it very clear what they were actually for. ""Who are you?"" asked K., sitting half upright in his bed. The man, however, ignored the question as if his arrival simply had to be accepted, and merely replied, ""You rang?"" ""Anna should have brought me my breakfast,"" said K. He tried to work out who the man actually was, first in silence, just through observation and by thinking about it, but the man didn't stay still to be looked at for very long. Instead he went over to the door, opened it slightly, and said to someone who was clearly standing immediately behind it, ""He wants Anna to bring him his breakfast."" There was a little laughter in the neighbouring room, it was not clear from the sound of it whether there were several people laughing. The strange man could not have learned anything from it that he hadn't known already, but now he said to K., as if making his report ""It is not possible."" ""It would be the first time that's happened,"" said K., as he jumped out of bed and quickly pulled on his trousers. ""I want to see who that is in the next room, and why it is that Mrs. Grubach has let me be disturbed in this way."" It immediately occurred to him that he needn't have said this out loud, and that he must to some extent have acknowledged their authority by doing so, but that didn't seem important to him at the time. That, at least, is how the stranger took it, as he said, ""Don't you think you'd better stay where you are?"" ""I want neither to stay here nor to be spoken to by you until you've introduced yourself."" ""I meant it for your own good,"" said the stranger and opened the door, this time without being asked. The next room, which K. entered more slowly than he had intended, looked at first glance exactly the same as it had the previous evening. It was Mrs. Grubach's living room, over-filled with furniture, tablecloths, porcelain and photographs. Perhaps there was a little more space in there than usual today, but if so it was not immediately obvious, especially as the main difference was the presence of a man sitting by the open window with a book from which he now looked up. ""You should have stayed in your room! Didn't Franz tell you?"" ""And what is it you want, then?"" said K., looking back and forth between this new acquaintance and the one named Franz, who had remained in the doorway. Through the open window he noticed the old woman again, who had come close to the window opposite so that she could continue to see everything. She was showing an inquisitiveness that really made it seem like she was going senile. ""I want to see Mrs. Grubach ... ,"" said K., making a movement as if tearing himself away from the two men - even though they were standing well away from him - and wanted to go. ""No,"" said the man at the window, who threw his book down on a coffee table and stood up. ""You can't go away when you're under arrest."" ""That's how it seems,"" said K. ""And why am I under arrest?"" he then asked. ""That's something we're not allowed to tell you. Go into your room and wait there. Proceedings are underway and you'll learn about everything all in good time. It's not really part of my job to be friendly towards you like this, but I hope no-one, apart from Franz, will hear about it, and he's been more friendly towards you than he should have been, under the rules, himself. If you carry on having as much good luck as you have been with your arresting officers",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,1,"then you can reckon on things going well with you."" K. wanted to sit down, but then he saw that, apart from the chair by the window, there was nowhere anywhere in the room where he could sit. ""You'll get the chance to see for yourself how true all this is,"" said Franz and both men then walked up to K. They were significantly bigger than him, especially the second man, who frequently slapped him on the shoulder. The two of them felt K.'s nightshirt, and said he would now have to wear one that was of much lower quality, but that they would keep the nightshirt along with his other underclothes and return them to him if his case turned out well. ""It's better for you if you give us the things than if you leave them in the storeroom,"" they said. ""Things have a tendency to go missing in the storeroom, and after a certain amount of time they sell things off, whether the case involved has come to an end or not. And cases like this can last a long time, especially the ones that have been coming up lately. They'd give you the money they got for them, but it wouldn't be very much as it's not what they're offered for them when they sell them that counts, it's how much they get slipped on the side, and things like that lose their value anyway when they get passed on from hand to hand, year after year."" K. paid hardly any attention to what they were saying, he did not place much value on what he may have still possessed or on who decided what happened to them. It was much more important to him to get a clear understanding of his position, but he could not think clearly while these people were here, the second policeman's belly - and they could only be policemen - looked friendly enough, sticking out towards him, but when K. looked up and saw his dry, boney face it did not seem to fit with the body. His strong nose twisted to one side as if ignoring K. and sharing an understanding with the other policeman. What sort of people were these? What were they talking about? What office did they belong to? K. was living in a free country, after all, everywhere was at peace, all laws were decent and were upheld, who was it who dared accost him in his own home? He was always inclined to take life as lightly as he could, to cross bridges when he came to them, pay no heed for the future, even when everything seemed under threat. But here that did not seem the right thing to do. He could have taken it all as a joke, a big joke set up by his colleagues at the bank for some unknown reason, or also perhaps because today was his thirtieth birthday, it was all possible of course, maybe all he had to do was laugh in the policemen's face in some way and they would laugh with him, maybe they were tradesmen from the corner of the street, they looked like they might be - but he was nonetheless determined, ever since he first caught sight of the one called Franz, not to lose any slight advantage he might have had over these people. There was a very slight risk that people would later say he couldn't understand a joke, but - although he wasn't normally in the habit of learning from experience - he might also have had a few unimportant occasions in mind when, unlike his more cautious friends, he had acted with no thought at all for what might follow and had been made to suffer for it. He didn't want that to happen again, not this time at least; if they were play-acting he would act along with them. He still had time. ""Allow me,"" he said, and hurried between the two policemen through into his room. ""He seems sensible enough,"" he heard them say behind him. Once in his room, he quickly pulled open the drawer of his writing desk, everything in it was very tidy but in his agitation he was unable to find the identification documents he was looking for straight away. He finally found his bicycle permit and was about to go back to the policemen with it when it seemed to him too petty, so he carried on searching until he found his birth certificate. Just as he got back in the adjoining room the door on the other side opened and Mrs. Grubach was about to enter. He only saw her for an instant, for as soon as she recognised K. she was clearly embarrassed, asked for forgiveness and disappeared, closing",no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,2,"the door behind her very carefully. ""Do come in,"" K. could have said just then. But now he stood in the middle of the room with his papers in his hand and still looking at the door which did not open again. He stayed like that until he was startled out of it by the shout of the policeman who sat at the little table at the open window and, as K. now saw, was eating his breakfast. ""Why didn't she come in?"" he asked. ""She's not allowed to,"" said the big policeman. ""You're under arrest, aren't you."" ""But how can I be under arrest? And how come it's like this?"" ""Now you're starting again,"" said the policeman, dipping a piece of buttered bread in the honeypot. ""We don't answer questions like that."" ""You will have to answer them,"" said K. ""Here are my identification papers, now show me yours and I certainly want to see the arrest warrant."" ""Oh, my God!"" said the policeman. ""In a position like yours, and you think you can start giving orders, do you? It won't do you any good to get us on the wrong side, even if you think it will - we're probably more on your side that anyone else you know!"" ""That's true, you know, you'd better believe it,"" said Franz, holding a cup of coffee in his hand which he did not lift to his mouth but looked at K. in a way that was probably meant to be full of meaning but could not actually be understood. K. found himself, without intending it, in a mute dialogue with Franz, but then slapped his hand down on his papers and said, ""Here are my identity documents."" ""And what do you want us to do about it?"" replied the big policeman, loudly. ""The way you're carrying on, it's worse than a child. What is it you want? Do you want to get this great, bloody trial of yours over with quickly by talking about ID and arrest warrants with us? We're just coppers, that's all we are. Junior officers like us hardly know one end of an ID card from another, all we've got to do with you is keep an eye on you for ten hours a day and get paid for it. That's all we are. Mind you, what we can do is make sure that the high officials we work for find out just what sort of person it is they're going to arrest, and why he should be arrested, before they issue the warrant. There's no mistake there. Our authorities as far as I know, and I only know the lowest grades, don't go out looking for guilt among the public; it's the guilt that draws them out, like it says in the law, and they have to send us police officers out. That's the law. Where d'you think there'd be any mistake there?"" ""I don't know this law,"" said K. ""So much the worse for you, then,"" said the policeman. ""It's probably exists only in your heads,"" said K., he wanted, in some way, to insinuate his way into the thoughts of the policemen, to re-shape those thoughts to his benefit or to make himself at home there. But the policeman just said dismissively, ""You'll find out when it affects you."" Franz joined in, and said, ""Look at this, Willem, he admits he doesn't know the law and at the same time insists he's innocent."" ""You're quite right, but we can't get him to understand a thing,"" said the other. K. stopped talking with them; do I, he thought to himself, do I really have to carry on getting tangled up with the chattering of base functionaries like this? - and they admit themselves that they are of the lowest position. They're talking about things of which they don't have the slightest understanding, anyway. It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of themselves. I just need few words with someone of the same social standing as myself and everything will be incomparably clearer, much clearer than a long conversation with these two can make it. He walked up and down the free space in the room a couple of times, across the street he could see the old woman who, now, had pulled an old man, much older than herself, up to the window and had her arms around him. K. had to put an end to this display, ""Take me to your superior,"" he said. ""As soon as he wants to see you. Not before,"" said the policeman, the one called Willem. ""And now my advice to you,"" he added, ""is to go into your room, stay calm, and wait and see what's to be done with you.",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,3,"If you take our advice, you won't tire yourself out thinking about things to no purpose, you need to pull yourself together as there's a lot that's going to required of you. You've not behaved towards us the way we deserve after being so good to you, you forget that we, whatever we are, we're still free men and you're not, and that's quite an advantage. But in spite of all that we're still willing, if you've got the money, to go and get you some breakfast from the caf over the road."" Without giving any answer to this offer, K. stood still for some time. Perhaps, if he opened the door of the next room or even the front door, the two of them would not dare to stand in his way, perhaps that would be the simplest way to settle the whole thing, by bringing it to a head. But maybe they would grab him, and if he were thrown down on the ground he would lose all the advantage he, in a certain respect, had over them. So he decided on the more certain solution, the way things would go in the natural course of events, and went back in his room without another word either from him or from the policemen. He threw himself down on his bed, and from the dressing table he took the nice apple that he had put there the previous evening for his breakfast. Now it was all the breakfast he had and anyway, as he confirmed as soon as he took his first, big bite of it, it was far better than a breakfast he could have had through the good will of the policemen from the dirty caf. He felt well and confident, he had failed to go into work at the bank this morning but that could easily be excused because of the relatively high position he held there. Should he really send in his explanation? He wondered about it. If nobody believed him, and in this case that would be understandable, he could bring Mrs. Grubach in as a witness, or even the old pair from across the street, who probably even now were on their way over to the window opposite. It puzzled K., at least it puzzled him looking at it from the policemen's point of view, that they had made him go into the room and left him alone there, where he had ten different ways of killing himself. At the same time, though, he asked himself, this time looking at it from his own point of view, what reason he could have to do so. Because those two were sitting there in the next room and had taken his breakfast, perhaps? It would have been so pointless to kill himself that, even if he had wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him unable. Maybe, if the policemen had not been so obviously limited in their mental abilities, it could have been supposed that they had come to the same conclusion and saw no danger in leaving him alone because of it. They could watch now, if they wanted, and see how he went over to the cupboard in the wall where he kept a bottle of good schnapps, how he first emptied a glass of it in place of his breakfast and how he then took a second glassful in order to give himself courage, the last one just as a precaution for the unlikely chance it would be needed. Then he was so startled by a shout to him from the other room that he struck his teeth against the glass. ""The supervisor wants to see you!"" a voice said. It was only the shout that startled him, this curt, abrupt, military shout, that he would not have expected from the policeman called Franz. In itself, he found the order very welcome. ""At last!"" he called back, locked the cupboard and, without delay, hurried into the next room. The two policemen were standing there and chased him back into his bedroom as if that were a matter of course. ""What d'you think you're doing?"" they cried. ""Think you're going to see the supervisor dressed in just your shirt, do you? He'd see to it you got a right thumping, and us and all!"" ""Let go of me for God's sake!"" called K., who had already been pushed back as far as his wardrobe, ""if you accost me when I'm still in bed you can't expect to find me in my evening dress."" ""That won't help you,"" said the policemen, who always became very quiet, almost sad, when K. began to shout, and in that way confused him or, to some extent, brought him to his senses. ""Ridiculous formalities!"" he grumbled, as",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,4,"he lifted his coat from the chair and kept it in both his hands for a little while, as if holding it out for the policemen's inspection. They shook their heads. ""It's got to be a black coat,"" they said. At that, K. threw the coat to the floor and said - without knowing even himself what he meant by it - ""Well it's not going to be the main trial, after all."" The policemen laughed, but continued to insist, ""It's got to be a black coat."" ""Well that's alright by me if it makes things go any faster,"" said K. He opened the wardrobe himself, spent a long time searching through all the clothes, and chose his best black suit which had a short jacket that had greatly surprised those who knew him, then he also pulled out a fresh shirt and began, carefully, to get dressed. He secretly told himself that he had succeeded in speeding things up by letting the policemen forget to make him have a bath. He watched them to see if they might remember after all, but of course it never occurred to them, although Willem did not forget to send Franz up to the supervisor with the message saying that K. was getting dressed. Once he was properly dressed, K. had to pass by Willem as he went through the next room into the one beyond, the door of which was already wide open. K. knew very well that this room had recently been let to a typist called 'Miss Brstner'. She was in the habit of going out to work very early and coming back home very late, and K. had never exchanged more than a few words of greeting with her. Now, her bedside table had been pulled into the middle of the room to be used as a desk for these proceedings, and the supervisor sat behind it. He had his legs crossed, and had thrown one arm over the backrest of the chair. In one corner of the room there were three young people looking at the photographs belonging to Miss Brstner that had been put into a piece of fabric on the wall. Hung up on the handle of the open window was a white blouse. At the window across the street, there was the old pair again, although now their number had increased, as behind them, and far taller than they were, stood a man with an open shirt that showed his chest and a reddish goatee beard which he squeezed and twisted with his fingers. ""Josef K.?"" asked the supervisor, perhaps merely to attract K.'s attention as he looked round the room. K. nodded. ""I daresay you were quite surprised by all that's been taking place this morning,"" said the supervisor as, with both hands, he pushed away the few items on the bedside table - the candle and box of matches, a book and a pin cushion which lay there as if they were things he would need for his own business. ""Certainly,"" said K., and he began to feel relaxed now that, at last, he stood in front of someone with some sense, someone with whom he would be able to talk about his situation. ""Certainly I'm surprised, but I'm not in any way very surprised."" ""You're not very surprised?"" asked the supervisor, as he positioned the candle in the middle of the table and the other things in a group around it. ""Perhaps you don't quite understand me,"" K. hurriedly pointed out. ""What I mean is ... "" here K. broke off what he was saying and looked round for somewhere to sit. ""I may sit down, mayn't I?"" he asked. ""That's not usual,"" the supervisor answered. ""What I mean is...,"" said K. without delaying a second time, ""that, yes, I am very surprised but when you've been in the world for thirty years already and had to make your own way through everything yourself, which has been my lot, then you become hardened to surprises and don't take them too hard. Especially not what's happened today."" ""Why especially not what's happened today?"" ""I wouldn't want to say that I see all of this as a joke, you seem to have gone to too much trouble making all these arrangements for that. Everyone in the house must be taking part in it as well as all of you, that would be going beyond what could be a joke. So I don't want to say that this is a joke."" ""Quite right,"" said the supervisor, looking to see how many matches were left in the box. ""But on the other hand,"" K. went on, looking round at everyone there and even wishing he could get the attention of the three who were looking at",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,5,"the photographs, ""on the other hand this really can't be all that important. That follows from the fact that I've been indicted, but can't think of the slightest offence for which I could be indicted. But even that is all beside the point, the main question is: Who is issuing the indictment? What office is conducting this affair? Are you officials? None of you is wearing a uniform, unless what you are wearing"" - here he turned towards Franz - ""is meant to be a uniform, it's actually more of a travelling suit. I require a clear answer to all these questions, and I'm quite sure that once things have been made clear we can take our leave of each other on the best of terms."" The supervisor slammed the box of matches down on the table. ""You're making a big mistake,"" he said. ""These gentlemen and I have got nothing to do with your business, in fact we know almost nothing about you. We could be wearing uniforms as proper and exact as you like and your situation wouldn't be any the worse for it. As to whether you're on a charge, I can't give you any sort of clear answer to that, I don't even know whether you are or not. You're under arrest, you're quite right about that, but I don't know any more than that. Maybe these officers have been chit-chatting with you, well if they have that's all it is, chit-chat. I can't give you an answer to your questions, but I can give you a bit of advice: You'd better think less about us and what's going to happen to you, and think a bit more about yourself. And stop making all this fuss about your sense of innocence; you don't make such a bad impression, but with all this fuss you're damaging it. And you ought to do a bit less talking, too. Almost everything you've said so far has been things we could have taken from your behaviour, even if you'd said no more than a few words. And what you have said has not exactly been in your favour."" K. stared at the supervisor. Was this man, probably younger than he was, lecturing him like a schoolmaster? Was he being punished for his honesty with a telling off? And was he to learn nothing about the reasons for his arrest or those who were arresting him? He became somewhat cross and began to walk up and down. No-one stopped him doing this and he pushed his sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his hair, went over to the three men, said, ""It makes no sense,"" at which these three turned round to face him and came towards him with serious expressions. He finally came again to a halt in front of the supervisor's desk. ""State Attorney Hasterer is a good friend of mine,"" he said, ""can I telephone him?"" ""Certainly,"" said the supervisor, ""but I don't know what the point of that will be, I suppose you must have some private matter you want to discuss with him."" ""What the point is?"" shouted K., more disconcerted that cross. ""Who do you think you are? You want to see some point in it while you're carrying out something as pointless as it could be? It's enough to make you cry! These gentlemen first accost me, and now they sit or stand about in here and let me be hauled up in front of you. What point there would be, in telephoning a state attorney when I'm ostensibly under arrest? Very well, I won't make the telephone call."" ""You can call him if you want to,"" said the supervisor, stretching his had out towards the outer room where the telephone was, ""please, go on, do make your phone call."" ""No, I don't want to any more,"" said K., and went over to the window. Across the street, the people were still there at the window, and it was only now that K. had gone up to his window that they seemed to become uneasy about quietly watching what was going on. The old couple wanted to get up but the man behind them calmed them down. ""We've got some kind of audience over there,"" called K. to the supervisor, quite loudly, as he pointed out with his forefinger. ""Go away,"" he then called across to them. And the three of them did immediately retreat a few steps, the old pair even found themselves behind the man who then concealed them with the breadth of his body and seemed, going by the movements of his mouth, to be saying something incomprehensible into the distance. They did not disappear entirely, though, but seemed to be waiting for the moment when they could come back to",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,6,"the window without being noticed. ""Intrusive, thoughtless people!"" said K. as he turned back into the room. The supervisor may have agreed with him, at least K. thought that was what he saw from the corner of his eye. But it was just as possible that he had not even been listening as he had his hand pressed firmly down on the table and seemed to be comparing the length of his fingers. The two policemen were sitting on a chest covered with a coloured blanket, rubbing their knees. The three young people had put their hands on their hips and were looking round aimlessly. Everything was still, like in some office that has been forgotten about. ""Now, gentlemen,"" called out K., and for a moment it seemed as if he was carrying all of them on his shoulders, ""it looks like your business with me is over with. In my opinion, it's best now to stop wondering about whether you're proceeding correctly or incorrectly, and to bring the matter to a peaceful close with a mutual handshake. If you are of the same opinion, then please... "" and he walked up to the supervisor's desk and held out his hand to him. The supervisor raised his eyes, bit his lip and looked at K.'s outstretched hand; K still believed the supervisor would do as he suggested. But instead, he stood up, picked up a hard round hat that was laying on Miss Brstner's bed and put it carefully onto his head, using both hands as if trying on a new hat. ""Everything seems so simple to you, doesn't it,"" he said to K. as he did so, ""so you think we should bring the matter to a peaceful close, do you. No, no, that won't do. Mind you, on the other hand I certainly wouldn't want you to think there's no hope for you. No, why should you think that? You're simply under arrest, nothing more than that. That's what I had to tell you, that's what I've done and now I've seen how you've taken it. That's enough for one day and we can take our leave of each other, for the time being at least. I expect you'll want to go in to the bank now, won't you."" ""In to the bank?"" asked K., ""I thought I was under arrest."" K. said this with a certain amount of defiance as, although his handshake had not been accepted, he was feeling more independent of all these people, especially since the supervisor had stood up. He was playing with them. If they left, he had decided he would run after them and offer to let them arrest him. That's why he even repeated, ""How can I go in to the bank when I'm under arrest?"" ""I see you've misunderstood me,"" said the supervisor who was already at the door. ""It's true that you're under arrest, but that shouldn't stop you from carrying out your job. And there shouldn't be anything to stop you carrying on with your usual life."" ""In that case it's not too bad, being under arrest,"" said K., and went up close to the supervisor. ""I never meant it should be anything else,"" he replied. ""It hardly seems to have been necessary notify me of the arrest in that case,"" said K., and went even closer. The others had also come closer. All of them had gathered together into a narrow space by the door. ""That was my duty,"" said the supervisor. ""A silly duty,"" said K., unyielding. ""Maybe so,"" replied the supervisor, ""only don't let's waste our time talking on like this. I had assumed you'd be wanting to go to the bank. As you're paying close attention to every word I'll add this: I'm not forcing you to go to the bank, I'd just assumed you wanted to. And to make things easier for you, and to let you get to the bank with as little fuss as possible I've put these three gentlemen, colleagues of yours, at your disposal."" ""What's that?"" exclaimed K., and looked at the three in astonishment. He could only remember seeing them in their group by the photographs, but these characterless, anaemic young people were indeed officials from his bank, not colleagues of his, that was putting it too high and it showed a gap in the omniscience of the supervisor, but they were nonetheless junior members of staff at the bank. How could K. have failed to see that? How occupied he must have been with the supervisor and the policemen not to have recognised these three! Rabensteiner, with his stiff demeanour and swinging hands, Kullich, with his blonde hair and deep-set eyes, and Kaminer, with his involuntary grin caused by chronic muscle spasms. ""Good morning,"" said K.",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,7,"after a while, extending his hand to the gentlemen as they bowed correctly to him. ""I didn't recognise you at all. So, we'll go into work now, shall we?"" The gentlemen laughed and nodded enthusiastically, as if that was what they had been waiting for all the time, except that K. had left his hat in his room so they all dashed, one after another, into the room to fetch it, which caused a certain amount of embarrassment. K. stood where he was and watched them through the open double doorway, the last to go, of course, was the apathetic Rabensteiner who had broken into no more than an elegant trot. Kaminer got to the hat and K., as he often had to do at the bank, forcibly reminded himself that the grin was not deliberate, that he in fact wasn't able to grin deliberately. At that moment Mrs. Grubach opened the door from the hallway into the living room where all the people were. She did not seem to feel guilty about anything at all, and K., as often before, looked down at the belt of her apron which, for no reason, cut so deeply into her hefty body. Once downstairs, K., with his watch in his hand, decided to take a taxi - he had already been delayed by half an hour and there was no need to make the delay any longer. Kaminer ran to the corner to summon it, and the two others were making obvious efforts to keep K. diverted when Kullich pointed to the doorway of the house on the other side of the street where the large man with the blonde goatee beard appeared and, a little embarrassed at first at letting himself be seen in his full height, stepped back to the wall and leant against it. The old couple were probably still on the stairs. K. was cross with Kullich for pointing out this man whom he had already seen himself, in fact whom he had been expecting. ""Don't look at him!"" he snapped, without noticing how odd it was to speak to free men in this way. But there was no explanation needed anyway as just then the taxi arrived, they sat inside and set off. Inside the taxi, K. remembered that he had not noticed the supervisor and the policemen leaving - the supervisor had stopped him noticing the three bank staff and now the three bank staff had stopped him noticing the supervisor. This showed that K. was not very attentive, and he resolved to watch himself more carefully in this respect. Nonetheless, he gave it no thought as he twisted himself round and leant over onto the rear shelf of the car to catch sight of the supervisor and the policemen if he could. But he turned back round straight away and leant comfortably into the corner of the taxi without even having made the effort to see anyone. Although it did not seem like it, now was just the time when he needed some encouragement, but the gentlemen seemed tired just then, Rabensteiner looked out of the car to the right, Kullich to the left and only Kaminer was there with his grin at K.'s service. It would have been inhumane to make fun of that. That spring, whenever possible, K. usually spent his evenings after work - he usually stayed in the office until nine o'clock - with a short walk, either by himself or in the company of some of the bank officials, and then he would go into a pub where he would sit at the regulars' table with mostly older men until eleven. There were, however, also exceptions to this habit, times, for instance, when K. was invited by the bank's manager (whom he greatly respected for his industry and trustworthiness) to go with him for a ride in his car or to eat dinner with him at his large house. K. would also go, once a week, to see a girl called Elsa who worked as a waitress in a wine bar through the night until late in the morning. During the daytime she only received visitors while still in bed. That evening, though, - the day had passed quickly with a lot of hard work and many respectful and friendly birthday greetings - K. wanted to go straight home. Each time he had any small break from the day's work he considered, without knowing exactly what he had in mind, that Mrs. Grubach's flat seemed to have been put into great disarray by the events of that morning, and that it was up to him to put it back into order. Once order had been restored, every trace of those events would have been erased and everything would take its",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,8,"previous course once more. In particular, there was nothing to fear from the three bank officials, they had immersed themselves back into their paperwork and there was no alteration to be seen in them. K. had called each of them, separately or all together, into his office that day for no other reason than to observe them; he was always satisfied and had always been able to let them go again. At half past nine that evening, when he arrived back in front of the building where he lived, he met a young lad in the doorway who was standing there, his legs apart and smoking a pipe. ""Who are you?"" immediately asked K., bringing his face close to the lad's, as it was hard to see in the half light of the landing. ""I'm the landlord's son, sir,"" answered the lad, taking the pipe from his mouth and stepping to one side. ""The landlord's son?"" asked K., and impatiently knocked on the ground with his stick. ""Did you want anything, sir? Would you like me to fetch my father?"" ""No, no,"" said K., there was something forgiving in his voice, as if the boy had harmed him in some way and he was excusing him. ""It's alright,"" he said then, and went on, but before going up the stairs he turned round once more. He could have gone directly to his room, but as he wanted to speak with Mrs. Grubach he went straight to her door and knocked. She was sat at the table with a knitted stocking and a pile of old stockings in front of her. K. apologised, a little embarrassed at coming so late, but Mrs. Grubach was very friendly and did not want to hear any apology, she was always ready to speak to him, he knew very well that he was her best and her favourite tenant. K. looked round the room, it looked exactly as it usually did, the breakfast dishes, which had been on the table by the window that morning, had already been cleared away. ""A woman's hands will do many things when no-one's looking,"" he thought, he might himself have smashed all the dishes on the spot but certainly would not have been able to carry it all out. He looked at Mrs. Grubach with some gratitude. ""Why are you working so late?"" he asked. They were now both sitting at the table, and K. now and then sank his hands into the pile of stockings. ""There's a lot of work to do,"" she said, ""during the day I belong to the tenants; if I'm to sort out my own things there are only the evenings left to me."" ""I fear I may have caused you some exceptional work today."" ""How do you mean, Mr. K.?"" she asked, becoming more interested and leaving her work in her lap. ""I mean the men who were here this morning."" ""Oh, I see,"" she said, and went peacefully back to what she was doing, ""that was no trouble, not especially."" K. looked on in silence as she took up the knitted stocking once more. She seems surprised at my mentioning it, he thought, she seems to think it's improper for me to mention it. All the more important for me to do so. An old woman is the only person I can speak about it with. ""But it must have caused some work for you,"" he said then, ""but it won't happen again."" ""No, it can't happen again,"" she agreed, and smiled at K. in a way that was almost pained. ""Do you mean that seriously?"" asked K. ""Yes,"" she said, more gently, ""but the important thing is you mustn't take it too hard. There are so many awful things happening in the world! As you're being so honest with me, Mr. K., I can admit to you that I listened to a little of what was going on from behind the door, and that those two policemen told me one or two things as well. It's all to do with your happiness, and that's something that's quite close to my heart, perhaps more than it should be as I am, after all, only your landlady. Anyway, so I heard one or two things but I can't really say that it's about anything very serious. No. You have been arrested, but it's not in the same way as when they arrest a thief. If you're arrested in the same way as a thief, then it's bad, but an arrest like this ... . It seems to me that it's something very complicated - forgive me if I'm saying something stupid - something very complicated that I don't understand, but something that you don't really need to understand anyway."" ""There's nothing stupid about",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,9,"what you've said, Mrs. Grubach, or at least I partly agree with you, only, the way I judge the whole thing is harsher than yours, and think it's not only not something complicated but simply a fuss about nothing. I was just caught unawares, that's what happened. If I had got up as soon as I was awake without letting myself get confused because Anna wasn't there, if I'd got up and paid no regard to anyone who might have been in my way and come straight to you, if I'd done something like having my breakfast in the kitchen as an exception, asked you to bring my clothes from my room, in short, if I had behaved sensibly then nothing more would have happened, everything that was waiting to happen would have been stifled. People are so often unprepared. In the bank, for example, I am well prepared, nothing of this sort could possibly happen to me there, I have my own assistant there, there are telephones for internal and external calls in front of me on the desk, I continually receive visits from people, representatives, officials, but besides that, and most importantly, I'm always occupied with my work, that's to say I'm always alert, it would even be a pleasure for me to find myself faced with something of that sort. But now it's over with, and I didn't really even want to talk about it any more, only I wanted to hear what you, as a sensible woman, thought about it all, and I'm very glad to hear that we're in agreement. But now you must give me your hand, an agreement of this sort needs to be confirmed with a handshake. "" Will she shake hands with me? The supervisor didn't shake hands, he thought, and looked at the woman differently from before, examining her. She stood up, as he had also stood up, and was a little self-conscious, she hadn't been able to understand everything that that K. said. As a result of this self consciousness she said something that she certainly did not intend and certainly was not appropriate. ""Don't take it so hard, Mr. K.,"" she said, with tears in her voice and also, of course, forgetting the handshake. ""I didn't know I was taking it hard,"" said K., feeling suddenly tired and seeing that if this woman did agree with him it was of very little value. Before going out the door he asked, ""Is Miss Brstner home?"" ""No,"" said Mrs. Grubach, smiling as she gave this simple piece of information, saying something sensible at last. ""She's at the theatre. Did you want to see her? Should I give her a message?"" ""I, er, I just wanted to have a few words with her."" ""I'm afraid I don't know when she's coming in; she usually gets back late when she's been to the theatre."" ""It really doesn't matter,"" said K. his head hanging as he turned to the door to leave, ""I just wanted to give her my apology for taking over her room today."" ""There's no need for that, Mr. K., you're too conscientious, the young lady doesn't know anything about it, she hasn't been home since early this morning and everything's been tidied up again, you can see for yourself."" And she opened the door to Miss Brstner's room. ""Thank you, I'll take your word for it,"" said K, but went nonetheless over to the open door. The moon shone quietly into the unlit room. As far as could be seen, everything was indeed in its place, not even the blouse was hanging on the window handle. The pillows on the bed looked remarkably plump as they lay half in the moonlight. ""Miss Brstner often comes home late,"" said K., looking at Mrs. Grubach as if that were her responsibility. ""That's how young people are!"" said Mrs. Grubach in to excuse herself. ""Of course, of course,"" said K., ""but it can be taken too far."" ""Yes, it can be,"" said Mrs. Grubach, ""you're so right, Mr. K. Perhaps it is in this case. I certainly wouldn't want to say anything nasty about Miss Brstner, she is a good, sweet girl, friendly, tidy, punctual, works hard, I appreciate all that very much, but one thing is true, she ought to have more pride, be a bit less forthcoming. Twice this month already, in the street over the way, I've seen her with a different gentleman. I really don't like saying this, you're the only one I've said this to, Mr. K., I swear to God, but I'm going to have no choice but to have a few words with Miss Brstner about it myself. And it's not the only thing about her that I'm worried about."" ""Mrs. Grubach, you are on",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,10,"quite the wrong track ,"" said K., so angry that he was hardly able to hide it, ""and you have moreover misunderstood what I was saying about Miss Brstner, that is not what I meant. In fact I warn you quite directly not to say anything to her, you are quite mistaken, I know Miss Brstner very well and there is no truth at all in what you say. And what's more, perhaps I'm going to far, I don't want to get in your way, say to her whatever you see fit. Good night."" ""Mr. K.,"" said Mrs. Grubach as if asking him for something and hurrying to his door which he had already opened, ""I don't want to speak to Miss Brstner at all, not yet, of course I'll continue to keep an eye on her but you're the only one I've told what I know. And it is, after all something that everyone who lets rooms has to do if she's to keep the house decent, that's all I'm trying to do."" ""Decent!"" called out K. through the crack in the door, ""if you want to keep the house decent you'll first have to give me notice."" Then he slammed the door shut, there was a gentle knocking to which he paid no more attention. He did not feel at all like going to bed, so he decided to stay up, and this would also give him the chance to find out when Miss Brstner would arrive home. Perhaps it would also still be possible, even if a little inappropriate, to have a few words with her. As he lay there by the window, pressing his hands to his tired eyes, he even thought for a moment that he might punish Mrs. Grubach by persuading Miss Brstner to give in her notice at the same time as he would. But he immediately realised that that would be shockingly excessive, and there would even be the suspicion that he was moving house because of the incidents of that morning. Nothing would have been more nonsensical and, above all, more pointless and contemptible. When he had become tired of looking out onto the empty street he slightly opened the door to the living room so that he could see anyone who entered the flat from where he was and lay down on the couch. He lay there, quietly smoking a cigar, until about eleven o'clock. He wasn't able to hold out longer than that, and went a little way into the hallway as if in that way he could make Miss Brstner arrive sooner. He had no particular desire for her, he could not even remember what she looked like, but now he wanted to speak to her and it irritated him that her late arrival home meant this day would be full of unease and disorder right to its very end. It was also her fault that he had not had any dinner that evening and that he had been unable to visit Elsa as he had intended. He could still make up for both of those things, though, if he went to the wine bar where Elsa worked. He wanted to do so even later, after the discussion with Miss Brstner. It was already gone half past eleven when someone could be heard in the stairway. K., who had been lost in his thoughts in the hallway, walking up and down loudly as if it were his own room, fled behind his door. Miss Brstner had arrived. Shivering, she pulled a silk shawl over her slender shoulders as she locked the door. The next moment she would certainly go into her room, where K. ought not to intrude in the middle of the night; that meant he would have to speak to her now, but, unfortunately, he had not put the electric light on in his room so that when he stepped out of the dark it would give the impression of being an attack and would certainly, at the very least, have been quite alarming. There was no time to lose, and in his helplessness he whispered through the crack of the door, ""Miss Brstner."" It sounded like he was pleading with her, not calling to her. ""Is there someone there?"" asked Miss Brstner, looking round with her eyes wide open. ""It's me,"" said K. and came out. ""Oh, Mr. K.!"" said Miss Brstner with a smile. ""Good Evening,"" and offered him her hand. ""I wanted to have a word with you, if you would allow me?"" ""Now?"" asked Miss Brstner, ""does it have to be now? It is a little odd, isn't it?"" ""I've been waiting for you since nine o'clock."" ""Well, I was at the theatre, I didn't know anything about you waiting for me.""",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,11,"""The reason I need to speak to you only came up today"" ""I see, well I don't see why not, I suppose, apart from being so tired I could drop. Come into my room for a few minutes then. We certainly can't talk out here, we'd wake everyone up and I think that would be more unpleasant for us than for them. Wait here till I've put the light on in my room, and then turn the light down out here."" K. did as he was told, and then even waited until Miss Brstner came out of her room and quietly invited him, once more, to come in. ""Sit down,"" she said, indicating the ottoman, while she herself remained standing by the bedpost despite the tiredness she had spoken of; she did not even take off her hat, which was small but decorated with an abundance of flowers. ""What is it you wanted, then? I'm really quite curious."" She gently crossed her legs. ""I expect you'll say,"" K. began, ""that the matter really isn't all that urgent and we don't need to talk about it right now, but ..."" ""I never listen to introductions,"" said Miss Brstner. ""That makes my job so much easier,"" said K. ""This morning, to some extent through my fault, your room was made a little untidy, this happened because of people I did not know and against my will but, as I said, because of my fault; I wanted to apologise for it."" ""My room?"" asked Miss Brstner, and instead of looking round the room scrutinised K. ""It is true,"" said K., and now, for the first time, they looked each other in the eyes, ""there's no point in saying exactly how this came about."" ""But that's the interesting thing about it,"" said Miss Brstner. ""No,"" said K. ""Well then,"" said Miss Brstner, ""I don't want to force my way into any secrets, if you insist that it's of no interest I won't insist. I'm quite happy to forgive you for it, as you ask, especially as I can't see anything at all that's been left untidy."" With her hand laid flat on her lower hip, she made a tour around the room. At the mat where the photographs were she stopped. ""Look at this!"" she cried. ""My photographs really have been put in the wrong places. Oh, that's horrible. Someone really has been in my room without permission."" K. nodded, and quietly cursed Kaminer who worked at his bank and who was always active doing things that had neither use nor purpose. ""It is odd,"" said Miss Brstner, ""that I'm forced to forbid you to do something that you ought to have forbidden yourself to do, namely to come into my room when I'm not here."" ""But I did explain to you,"" said K., and went over to join her by the photographs, ""that it wasn't me who interfered with your photographs; but as you don't believe me I'll have to admit that the investigating committee brought along three bank employees with them, one of them must have touched your photographs and as soon as I get the chance I'll ask to have him dismissed from the bank. Yes, there was an investigating committee here,"" added K., as the young lady was looking at him enquiringly. ""Because of you?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" answered K. ""No!"" the lady cried with a laugh. ""Yes, they were,"" said K., ""you believe that I'm innocent then, do you?"" ""Well now, innocent ... "" said the lady, ""I don't want to start making any pronouncements that might have serious consequences, I don't really know you after all, it means they're dealing with a serious criminal if they send an investigating committee straight out to get him. But you're not in custody now - at least I take it you've not escaped from prison considering that you seem quite calm - so you can't have committed any crime of that sort."" ""Yes,"" said K., ""but it might be that the investigating committee could see that I'm innocent, or not so guilty as had been supposed."" ""Yes, that's certainly a possibility,"" said Miss Brstner, who seemed very interested. ""Listen,"" said K., ""you don't have much experience in legal matters."" ""No, that's true, I don't,"" said Miss Brstner, ""and I've often regretted it, as I'd like to know everything and I'm very interested in legal matters. There's something peculiarly attractive about the law, isn't there? But I'll certainly be perfecting my knowledge in this area, as next month I start work in a legal office."" ""That's very good,"" said K., ""that means you'll be able to give me some help with my trial."" ""That could well be,"" said Miss Brstner, ""why not? I like to make use of what I know."" ""I",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,12,"mean it quite seriously,"" said K., ""or at least, half seriously, as you do. This affair is too petty to call in a lawyer, but I could make good use of someone who could give me advice."" ""Yes, but if I'm to give you advice I'll have to know what it's all about,"" said Miss Brstner. ""That's exactly the problem,"" said K., ""I don't know that myself."" ""So you have been making fun of me, then,"" said Miss Brstner exceedingly disappointed, ""you really ought not to try something like that on at this time of night."" And she stepped away from the photographs where they had stood so long together. ""Miss Brstner, no,"" said K., ""I'm not making fun of you. Please believe me! I've already told you everything I know. More than I know, in fact, as it actually wasn't even an investigating committee, that's just what I called them because I don't know what else to call them. There was no cross questioning at all, I was merely arrested, but by a committee."" Miss Brstner sat on the ottoman and laughed again. ""What was it like then?"" she asked. ""It was terrible"" said K., although his mind was no longer on the subject, he had become totally absorbed by Miss Brstner's gaze who was supporting her chin on one hand - the elbow rested on the cushion of the ottoman - and slowly stroking her hip with the other. ""That's too vague,"" said Miss Brstner. ""What's too vague?"" asked K. Then he remembered himself and asked, ""Would you like me to show you what it was like?"" He wanted to move in some way but did not want to leave. ""I'm already tired,"" said Miss Brstner. ""You arrived back so late,"" said K. ""Now you've started telling me off. Well I suppose I deserve it as I shouldn't have let you in here in the first place, and it turns out there wasn't even any point."" ""Oh, there was a point, you'll see now how important a point it was,"" said K. ""May I move this table away from your bedside and put it here?"" ""What do you think you're doing?"" said Miss Brstner. ""Of course you can't!"" ""In that case I can't show you,"" said K., quite upset, as if Miss Brstner had committed some incomprehensible offence against him. ""Alright then, if you need it to show what you mean, just take the bedside table then,"" said Miss Brstner, and after a short pause added in a weak voice, ""I'm so tired I'm allowing more than I ought to."" K. put the little table in the middle of the room and sat down behind it. ""You have to get a proper idea of where the people were situated, it is very interesting. I'm the supervisor, sitting over there on the chest are two policemen, standing next to the photographs there are three young people. Hanging on the handle of the window is a white blouse - I just mention that by the way. And now it begins. Ah yes, I'm forgetting myself, the most important person of all, so I'm standing here in front of the table. the supervisor is sitting extremely comfortably with his legs crossed and his arm hanging over the backrest here like some layabout. And now it really does begin. the supervisor calls out as if he had to wake me up, in fact he shouts at me, I'm afraid, if I'm to make it clear to you, I'll have to shout as well, and it's nothing more than my name that he shouts out."" Miss Brstner, laughing as she listened to him, laid her forefinger on her mouth so that K. would not shout, but it was too late. K. was too engrossed in his role and slowly called out, ""Josef K.!"". It was not as loud as he had threatened, but nonetheless, once he had suddenly called it out, the cry seemed gradually to spread itself all round the room. There was a series of loud, curt and regular knocks at the door of the adjoining room. Miss Brstner went pale and laid her hand on her heart. K. was especially startled, as for a moment he had been quite unable to think of anything other than the events of that morning and the girl for whom he was performing them. He had hardly pulled himself together when he jumped over to Miss Brstner and took her hand. ""Don't be afraid,"" he whispered, ""I'll put everything right. But who can it be? It's only the living room next door, nobody sleeps in there."" ""Yes they do,"" whispered Miss Brstner into K.'s ear, ""a nephew of Mrs. Grubach's, an captain in the army, has been sleeping there since yesterday. There's no other",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,13,"room free. I'd forgotten about it too. Why did you have to shout like that? You've made me quite upset."" ""There is no reason for it,"" said K., and, now as she sank back onto the cushion, kissed her forehead. ""Go away, go away,"" she said, hurriedly sitting back up, ""get out of here, go, what is it you want, he's listening at the door he can hear everything. You're causing me so much trouble!"" ""I won't go,"" said K., ""until you've calmed down a bit. Come over into the other corner of the room, he won't be able to hear us there."" She let him lead her there. ""Don't forget,"" he said, ""although this might be unpleasant for you you're not in any real danger. You know how much esteem Mrs. Grubach has for me, she's the one who will make all the decisions in this, especially as the captain is her nephew, but she believes everything I say without question. What's more, she has borrowed a large sum of money from me and that makes her dependent on me. I will confirm whatever you say to explain our being here together, however inappropriate it might be, and I guarantee to make sure that Mrs. Grubach will not only say she believes the explanation in public but will believe it truly and sincerely. You will have no need to consider me in any way. If you wish to let it be known that I have attacked you then Mrs. Grubach will be informed of such and she will believe it without even losing her trust in me, that's how much respect she has for me."" Miss Brstner looked at the floor in front of her, quiet and a little sunk in on herself. ""Why would Mrs. Grubach not believe that I've attacked you?"" added K. He looked at her hair in front of him, parted, bunched down, reddish and firmly held in place. He thought she would look up at him, but without changing her manner she said, ""Forgive me, but it was the suddenness of the knocking that startled me so much, not so much what the consequences of the captain being here might be. It was all so quiet after you'd shouted, and then there was the knocking, that's was made me so shocked, and I was sitting right by the door, the knocking was right next to me. Thank you for your suggestions, but I won't accept them. I can bear the responsibility for anything that happens in my room myself, and I can do so with anyone. I'm surprised you don't realise just how insulting your suggestions are and what they imply about me, although I certainly acknowledge your good intentions. But now, please go, leave me alone, I need you to go now even more than I did earlier. The couple of minutes you asked for have grown into half an hour, more than half an hour now."" K. took hold of her hand, and then of her wrist, ""You're not cross with me, though?"" he said. She pulled her hand away and answered, ""No, no, I'm never cross with anyone."" He grasped her wrist once more, she tolerated it now and, in that way, lead him to the door. He had fully intended to leave. But when he reached the door he came to a halt as if he hadn't expected to find a door there, Miss Brstner made use of that moment to get herself free, open the door, slip out into the hallway and gently say to K. from there, ""Now, come along, please. Look,"" she pointed to the captain's door, from under which there was a light shining, ""he's put a light on and he's laughing at us."" ""Alright, I'm coming,"" said K., moved forward, took hold of her, kissed her on the mouth and then over her whole face like a thirsty animal lapping with its tongue when it eventually finds water. He finally kissed her on her neck and her throat and left his lips pressed there for a long time. He did not look up until there was a noise from the captain's room. ""I'll go now,"" he said, he wanted to address Miss Brstner by her Christian name, but did not know it. She gave him a tired nod, offered him her hand to kiss as she turned away as if she did not know what she was doing, and went back into her room with her head bowed. A short while later, K. was lying in his bed. He very soon went to sleep, but before he did he thought a little while about his behaviour, he was satisfied with it but felt some surprise that he was not more satisfied; he was seriously worried",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,14,"about Miss Brstner because of the captain. Chapter Two First Cross-examination K. was informed by telephone that there would be a small hearing concerning his case the following Sunday. He was made aware that these cross examinations would follow one another regularly, perhaps not every week but quite frequently. On the one hand it was in everyone's interest to bring proceedings quickly to their conclusion, but on the other hand every aspect of the examinations had to be carried out thoroughly without lasting too long because of the associated stress. For these reasons, it had been decided to hold a series of brief examinations following on one after another. Sunday had been chosen as the day for the hearings so that K. would not be disturbed in his professional work. It was assumed that he would be in agreement with this, but if he wished for another date then, as far as possible, he would be accommodated. Cross-examinations could even be held in the night, for instance, but K. would probably not be fresh enough at that time. Anyway, as long as K. made no objection, the hearing would be left on Sundays. It was a matter of course that he would have to appear without fail, there was probably no need to point this out to him. He would be given the number of the building where he was to present himself, which was in a street in a suburb well away from the city centre which K. had never been to before. Once he had received this notice, K. hung up the receiver without giving an answer; he had decided immediately to go there that Sunday, it was certainly necessary, proceedings had begun and he had to face up to it, and this first examination would probably also be the last. He was still standing in thought by the telephone when he heard the voice of the deputy director behind him - he wanted to use the telephone but K. stood in his way. ""Bad news?"" asked the deputy director casually, not in order to find anything out but just to get K. away from the device. ""No, no, "" said K., he stepped to one side but did not go away entirely. The deputy director picked up the receiver and, as he waited for his connection, turned away from it and said to K., ""One question, Mr. K.: Would you like to give me the pleasure of joining me on my sailing boat on Sunday morning? There's quite a few people coming, you're bound to know some of them. One of them is Hasterer, the state attorney. Would you like to come along? Do come along!"" K. tried to pay attention to what the deputy director was saying. It was of no small importance for him, as this invitation from the deputy director, with whom he had never got on very well, meant that he was trying to improve his relations with him. It showed how important K. had become in the bank and how its second most important official seemed to value his friendship, or at least his impartiality. He was only speaking at the side of the telephone receiver while he waited for his connection, but in giving this invitation the deputy director was humbling himself. But K. would have to humiliate him a second time as a result, he said, ""Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I will have no time on Sunday, I have a previous obligation."" ""Pity,"" said the deputy director, and turned to the telephone conversation that had just been connected. It was not a short conversation, but K., remained standing confused by the instrument all the time it was going on. It was only when the deputy director hung up that he was shocked into awareness and said, in order to partially excuse his standing there for no reason, ""I've just received a telephone call, there's somewhere I need to go, but they forgot to tell me what time."" ""Ask them then,"" said the deputy director. ""It's not that important,"" said K., although in that way his earlier excuse, already weak enough, was made even weaker. As he went, the deputy director continued to speak about other things. K. forced himself to answer, but his thoughts were mainly about that Sunday, how it would be best to get there for nine o'clock in the morning as that was the time that courts always start work on weekdays. The weather was dull on Sunday. K. was very tired, as he had stayed out drinking until late in the night celebrating with some of the regulars, and he had almost overslept. He dressed hurriedly, without the time to think and assemble the various plans he had worked out during the week.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,15,"With no breakfast, he rushed to the suburb he had been told about. Oddly enough, although he had little time to look around him, he came across the three bank officials involved in his case, Rabensteiner, Kullich and Kaminer. The first two were travelling in a tram that went across K.'s route, but Kaminer sat on the terrace of a caf and leant curiously over the wall as K. came over. All of them seemed to be looking at him, surprised at seeing their superior running; it was a kind of pride that made K. want to go on foot, this was his affair and the idea of any help from strangers, however slight, was repulsive to him, he also wanted to avoid asking for anyone's help because that would initiate them into the affair even if only slightly. And after all, he had no wish at all to humiliate himself before the committee by being too punctual. Anyway, now he was running so that he would get there by nine o'clock if at all possible, even though he had no appointment for this time. He had thought that he would recognise the building from a distance by some kind of sign, without knowing exactly what the sign would look like, or from some particular kind of activity outside the entrance. K. had been told that the building was in Juliusstrasse, but when he stood at the street's entrance it consisted on each side of almost nothing but monotonous, grey constructions, tall blocks of flats occupied by poor people. Now, on a Sunday morning, most of the windows were occupied, men in their shirtsleeves leant out smoking, or carefully and gently held small children on the sills. Other windows were piled up with bedding, above which the dishevelled head of a woman would briefly appear. People called out to each other across the street, one of the calls provoked a loud laugh about K. himself. It was a long street, and spaced evenly along it were small shops below street level, selling various kinds of foodstuffs, which you reached by going down a few steps. Women went in and out of them or stood chatting on the steps. A fruitmonger, taking his goods up to the windows, was just as inattentive as K. and nearly knocked him down with his cart. Just then, a gramophone, which in better parts of town would have been seen as worn out, began to play some murderous tune. K. went further into the street, slowly, as if he had plenty of time now, or as if the examining magistrate were looking at him from one of the windows and therefore knew that K. had found his way there. It was shortly after nine. The building was quite far down the street, it covered so much area it was almost extraordinary, and the gateway in particular was tall and long. It was clearly intended for delivery wagons belonging to the various warehouses all round the yard which were now locked up and carried the names of companies some of which K. knew from his work at the bank. In contrast with his usual habits, he remained standing a while at the entrance to the yard taking in all these external details. Near him, there was a bare-footed man sitting on a crate and reading a newspaper. There were two lads swinging on a hand cart. In front of a pump stood a weak, young girl in a bedjacket who, as the water flowed into her can, looked at K. There was a piece of rope stretched between two windows in a corner of the yard, with some washing hanging on it to dry. A man stood below it calling out instructions to direct the work being done. K. went over to the stairway to get to the room where the hearing was to take place, but then stood still again as besides these steps he could see three other stairway entrances, and there also seemed to be a small passageway at the end of the yard leading into a second yard. It irritated him that he had not been given more precise directions to the room, it meant they were either being especially neglectful with him or especially indifferent, and he decided to make that clear to them very loudly and very unambiguously. In the end he decided to climb up the stairs, his thoughts playing on something that he remembered the policeman, Willem, saying to him; that the court is attracted by the guilt, from which it followed that the courtroom must be on the stairway that K. selected by chance. As he went up he disturbed a large group of children playing on the stairs who looked at him as he stepped through",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,16,"their rows. ""Next time I come here,"" he said to himself, ""I must either bring sweets with me make them like me or a stick to hit them with."" Just before he reached the first landing he even had to wait a little while until a ball had finished its movement, two small lads with sly faces like grown-up scoundrels held him by his trouser-legs until it had; if he were to shake them off he would have to hurt them, and he was afraid of what noise they would make by shouting. On the first floor, his search began for real. He still felt unable to ask for the investigating committee, and so he invented a joiner called Lanz - that name occurred to him because the captain, Mrs. Grubach's nephew, was called Lanz - so that he could ask at every flat whether Lanz the joiner lived there and thus obtain a chance to look into the rooms. It turned out, though, that that was mostly possible without further ado, as almost all the doors were left open and the children ran in and out. Most of them were small, one-windowed rooms where they also did the cooking. Many women held babies in one arm and worked at the stove with the other. Half grown girls, who seemed to be dressed in just their pinafores worked hardest running to and fro. In every room, the beds were still in use by people who were ill, or still asleep, or people stretched out on them in their clothes. K. knocked at the flats where the doors were closed and asked whether Lanz the joiner lived there. It was usually a woman who opened the door, heard the enquiry and turned to somebody in the room who would raise himself from the bed. ""The gentleman's asking if a joiner called Lanz, lives here."" ""A joiner, called Lanz?"" he would ask from the bed."" ""That's right,"" K. would say, although it was clear that the investigating committee was not to be found there, and so his task was at an end. There were many who thought it must be very important for K. to find Lanz the joiner and thought long about it, naming a joiner who was not called Lanz or giving a name that had some vague similarity with Lanz, or they asked neighbours or accompanied K. to a door a long way away where they thought someone of that sort might live in the back part of the building or where someone would be who could advise K. better than they could themselves. K. eventually had to give up asking if he did not want to be led all round from floor to floor in this way. He regretted his initial plan, which had at first seemed so practical to him. As he reached the fifth floor, he decided to give up the search, took his leave of a friendly, young worker who wanted to lead him on still further and went down the stairs. But then the thought of how much time he was wasting made him cross, he went back again and knocked at the first door on the fifth floor. The first thing he saw in the small room was a large clock on the wall which already showed ten o'clock. ""Is there a joiner called Lanz who lives here?"" he asked. ""Pardon?"" said a young woman with black, shining eyes who was, at that moment, washing children's underclothes in a bucket. She pointed her wet hand towards the open door of the adjoining room. K. thought he had stepped into a meeting. A medium sized, two windowed room was filled with the most diverse crowd of people - nobody paid any attention to the person who had just entered. Close under its ceiling it was surrounded by a gallery which was also fully occupied and where the people could only stand bent down with their heads and their backs touching the ceiling. K., who found the air too stuffy, stepped out again and said to the young woman, who had probably misunderstood what he had said, ""I asked for a joiner, someone by the name of Lanz."" ""Yes,"" said the woman, ""please go on in."" K. would probably not have followed her if the woman had not gone up to him, taken hold of the door handle and said, ""I'll have to close the door after you, no-one else will be allowed in."" ""Very sensible,"" said K., ""but it's too full already."" But then he went back in anyway. He passed through between two men who were talking beside the door - one of them held both hands far out in front of himself making the movements of counting out money, the other looked",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,17,"him closely in the eyes - and someone took him by the hand. It was a small, red-faced youth. ""Come in, come in,"" he said. K. let himself be led by him, and it turned out that there was - surprisingly in a densely packed crowd of people moving to and fro - a narrow passage which may have been the division between two factions; this idea was reinforced by the fact that in the first few rows to the left and the right of him there was hardly any face looking in his direction, he saw nothing but the backs of people directing their speech and their movements only towards members of their own side. Most of them were dressed in black, in old, long, formal frock coats that hung down loosely around them. These clothes were the only thing that puzzled K., as he would otherwise have taken the whole assembly for a local political meeting. At the other end of the hall where K. had been led there was a little table set at an angle on a very low podium which was as overcrowded as everywhere else, and behind the table, near the edge of the podium, sat a small, fat, wheezing man who was talking with someone behind him. This second man was standing with his legs crossed and his elbows on the backrest of the chair, provoking much laughter. From time to time he threw his arm in the air as if doing a caricature of someone. The youth who was leading K. had some difficulty in reporting to the man. He had already tried twice to tell him something, standing on tip-toe, but without getting the man's attention as he sat there above him. It was only when one of the people up on the podium drew his attention to the youth that the man turned to him and leant down to hear what it was he quietly said. Then he pulled out his watch and quickly looked over at K. ""You should have been here one hour and five minutes ago,"" he said. K. was going to give him a reply but had no time to do so, as hardly had the man spoken than a general muttering arose all over the right hand side of the hall. ""You should have been here one hour and five minutes ago,"" the man now repeated, raising his voice this time, and quickly looked round the hall beneath him. The muttering also became immediately louder and, as the man said nothing more, died away only gradually. Now the hall was much quieter than when K. had entered. Only the people up in the gallery had not stopped passing remarks. As far as could be distinguished, up in the half-darkness, dust and haze, they seemed to be less well dressed than those below. Many of them had brought pillows that they had put between their heads and the ceiling so that they would not hurt themselves pressed against it. K. had decided he would do more watching than talking, so he did not defend himself for supposedly having come late, and simply said, ""Well maybe I have arrived late, I'm here now."" There followed loud applause, once more from the right hand side of the hall. Easy people to get on your side, thought K., and was bothered only by the quiet from the left hand side which was directly behind him and from which there was applause from only a few individuals. He wondered what he could say to get all of them to support him together or, if that were not possible, to at least get the support of the others for a while. ""Yes,"" said the man, ""but I'm now no longer under any obligation to hear your case"" - there was once more a muttering, but this time it was misleading as the man waved the people's objections aside with his hand and continued - ""I will, however, as an exception, continue with it today. But you should never arrive late like this again. And now, step forward!"" Someone jumped down from the podium so that there would be a place free for K., and K. stepped up onto it. He stood pressed closely against the table, the press of the crowd behind him was so great that he had to press back against it if he did not want to push the judge's desk down off the podium and perhaps the judge along with it. The judge, however, paid no attention to that but sat very comfortably on his chair and, after saying a few words to close his discussion with the man behind him, reached for a little note book, the only item on his desk. It was like an",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,18,"old school exercise book and had become quite misshapen from much thumbing. ""Now then,"" said the judge, thumbing through the book. He turned to K. with the tone of someone who knows his facts and said, ""you are a house painter?"" ""No,"" said K., ""I am the chief clerk in a large bank."" This reply was followed by laughter among the right hand faction down in the hall, it was so hearty that K. couldn't stop himself joining in with it. The people supported themselves with their hands on their knees and shook as if suffering a serious attack of coughing. Even some of those in the gallery were laughing. The judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no power over those below him in the hall, he tried to reduce what harm had been done in the gallery and jumped up threatening them, his eyebrows, until then hardly remarkable, pushed themselves up and became big, black and bushy over his eyes. The left hand side of the hall was still quiet, though, the people stood there in rows with their faces looking towards the podium listening to what was being said there, they observed the noise from the other side of the hall with the same quietness and even allowed some individuals from their own ranks, here and there, to go forward into the other faction. The people in the left faction were not only fewer in number than the right but probably were no more important than them, although their behaviour was calmer and that made it seem like they were. When K. now began to speak he was convinced he was doing it in the same way as them. ""Your question, My Lord, as to whether I am a house painter - in fact even more than that, you did not ask at all but merely imposed it on me - is symptomatic of the whole way these proceedings against me are being carried out. Perhaps you will object that there are no proceedings against me. You will be quite right, as there are proceedings only if I acknowledge that there are. But, for the moment, I do acknowledge it, out of pity for yourselves to a large extent. It's impossible not to observe all this business without feeling pity. I don't say things are being done without due care but I would like to make it clear that it is I who make the acknowledgement."" K. stopped speaking and looked down into the hall. He had spoken sharply, more sharply than he had intended, but he had been quite right. It should have been rewarded with some applause here and there but everything was quiet, they were all clearly waiting for what would follow, perhaps the quietness was laying the ground for an outbreak of activity that would bring this whole affair to an end. It was somewhat disturbing that just then the door at the end of the hall opened, the young washerwoman, who seemed to have finished her work, came in and, despite all her caution, attracted the attention of some of the people there. It was only the judge who gave K. any direct pleasure, as he seemed to have been immediately struck by K.'s words. Until then, he had listened to him standing, as K.'s speech had taken him by surprise while he was directing his attention to the gallery. Now, in the pause, he sat down very slowly, as if he did not want anyone to notice. He took out the notebook again, probably so that he could give the impression of being calmer. ""That won't help you, sir, "" continued K., ""even your little book will only confirm what I say."" K. was satisfied to hear nothing but his own quiet words in this room full of strangers, and he even dared casually to pick up the examining judge's notebook and, touching it only with the tips of his fingers as if it were something revolting, lifted it in the air, holding it just by one of the middle pages so that the others on each side of it, closely written, blotted and yellowing, flapped down. ""Those are the official notes of the examining judge,"" he said, and let the notebook fall down onto the desk. ""You can read in your book as much as you like, sir, I really don't have anything in this charge book to be afraid of, even though I don't have access to it as I wouldn't want it in my hand, I can only touch it with two fingers."" The judge grabbed the notebook from where it had fallen on the desk - which could only have been a sign of his deep humiliation, or at least that is how it must",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,19,"have been perceived - tried to tidy it up a little, and held it once more in front of himself in order to read from it. The people in the front row looked up at him, showing such tension on their faces that he looked back down at them for some time. Every one of them was an old man, some of them with white beards. Could they perhaps be the crucial group who could turn the whole assembly one way or the other? They had sunk into a state of motionlessness while K. gave his oration, and it had not been possible to raise them from this passivity even when the judge was being humiliated. ""What has happened to me,"" continued K., with less of the vigour he had had earlier, he continually scanned the faces in the first row, and this gave his address a somewhat nervous and distracted character, ""what has happened to me is not just an isolated case. If it were it would not be of much importance as it's not of much importance to me, but it is a symptom of proceedings which are carried out against many. It's on behalf of them that I stand here now, not for myself alone."" Without having intended it, he had raised his voice. Somewhere in the hall, someone raised his hands and applauded him shouting, ""Bravo! Why not then? Bravo! Again I say, Bravo!"" Some of the men in the first row groped around in their beards, none of them looked round to see who was shouting. Not even K. thought him of any importance but it did raise his spirits; he no longer thought it at all necessary that all of those in the hall should applaud him, it was enough if the majority of them began to think about the matter and if only one of them, now and then, was persuaded. ""I'm not trying to be a successful orator,"" said K. after this thought, ""that's probably more than I'm capable of anyway. I'm sure the examining judge can speak far better than I can, it is part of his job after all. All that I want is a public discussion of a public wrong. Listen: ten days ago I was placed under arrest, the arrest itself is something I laugh about but that's beside the point. They came for me in the morning when I was still in bed. Maybe the order had been given to arrest some house painter - that seems possible after what the judge has said - someone who is as innocent as I am, but it was me they chose. There were two police thugs occupying the next room. They could not have taken better precautions if I had been a dangerous robber. And these policemen were unprincipled riff-raff, they talked at me till I was sick of it, they wanted bribes, they wanted to trick me into giving them my clothes, they wanted money, supposedly so that they could bring me my breakfast after they had blatantly eaten my own breakfast in front of my eyes. And even that was not enough. I was led in front of the supervisor in another room. This was the room of a lady who I have a lot of respect for, and I was forced to look on while the supervisor and the policemen made quite a mess of this room because of me, although not through any fault of mine. It was not easy to stay calm, but I managed to do so and was completely calm when I asked the supervisor why it was that I was under arrest. If he were here he would have to confirm what I say. I can see him now, sitting on the chair belonging to that lady I mentioned - a picture of dull-witted arrogance. What do you think he answered? What he told me, gentlemen, was basically nothing at all; perhaps he really did know nothing, he had placed me under arrest and was satisfied. In fact he had done more than that and brought three junior employees from the bank where I work into the lady's room; they had made themselves busy interfering with some photographs that belonged to the lady and causing a mess. There was, of course, another reason for bringing these employees; they, just like my landlady and her maid, were expected to spread the news of my arrest and damage my public reputation and in particular to remove me from my position at the bank. Well they didn't succeed in any of that, not in the slightest, even my landlady, who is quite a simple person - and I will give you here her name in full respect, her name is Mrs. Grubach - even",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,20,"Mrs. Grubach was understanding enough to see that an arrest like this has no more significance than an attack carried out on the street by some youths who are not kept under proper control. I repeat, this whole affair has caused me nothing but unpleasantness and temporary irritation, but could it not also have had some far worse consequences?"" K. broke off here and looked at the judge, who said nothing. As he did so he thought he saw the judge use a movement of his eyes to give a sign to someone in the crowd. K. smiled and said, ""And now the judge, right next to me, is giving a secret sign to someone among you. There seems to be someone among you who is taking directions from above. I don't know whether the sign is meant to produce booing or applause, but I'll resist trying to guess what its meaning is too soon. It really doesn't matter to me, and I give his lordship the judge my full and public permission to stop giving secret signs to his paid subordinate down there and give his orders in words instead; let him just say ""Boo now!,"" and then the next time ""Clap now!"". Whether it was embarrassment or impatience, the judge rocked backwards and forwards on his seat. The man behind him, whom he had been talking with earlier, leant forward again, either to give him a few general words of encouragement or some specific piece of advice. Below them in the hall the people talked to each other quietly but animatedly. The two factions had earlier seemed to hold views strongly opposed to each other but now they began to intermingle, a few individuals pointed up at K., others pointed at the judge. The air in the room was fuggy and extremely oppressive, those who were standing furthest away could hardly even be seen through it. It must have been especially troublesome for those visitors who were in the gallery, as they were forced to quietly ask the participants in the assembly what exactly was happening, albeit with timid glances at the judge. The replies they received were just as quiet, and given behind the protection of a raised hand. ""I have nearly finished what I have to say,"" said K., and as there was no bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way that startled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from each other. ""Non of this concerns me, and I am therefore able to make a calm assessment of it, and, assuming that this so-called court is of any real importance, it will be very much to your advantage to listen to what I have to say. If you want to discuss what I say, please don't bother to write it down until later on, I don't have any time to waste and I'll soon be leaving."" There was immediate silence, which showed how well K. was in control of the crowd. There were no shouts among them as there had been at the start, no-one even applauded, but if they weren't already persuaded they seemed very close to it. K was pleased at the tension among all the people there as they listened to him, a rustling rose from the silence which was more invigorating than the most ecstatic applause could have been. ""There is no doubt,"" he said quietly, ""that there is some enormous organisation determining what is said by this court. In my case this includes my arrest and the examination taking place here today, an organisation that employs policemen who can be bribed, oafish supervisors and judges of whom nothing better can be said than that they are not as arrogant as some others. This organisation even maintains a high-level judiciary along with its train of countless servants, scribes, policemen and all the other assistance that it needs, perhaps even executioners and torturers - I'm not afraid of using those words. And what, gentlemen, is the purpose of this enormous organisation? Its purpose is to arrest innocent people and wage pointless prosecutions against them which, as in my case, lead to no result. How are we to avoid those in office becoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning? That is impossible, not even the highest judge would be able to achieve that for himself. That is why policemen try to steal the clothes off the back of those they arrest, that is why supervisors break into the homes of people they do not know, that is why innocent people are humiliated in front of crowds rather than being given a proper trial. The policemen only talked about the warehouses where they put the property of those they arrest, I would like to",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,21,"see these warehouses where the hard won possessions of people under arrest is left to decay, if, that is, it's not stolen by the thieving hands of the warehouse workers."" K. was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall, he shaded his eyes to see that far, as the dull light of day made the smoke whitish and hard to see through. It was the washerwoman whom K. had recognised as a likely source of disturbance as soon as she had entered. It was hard to see now whether it was her fault or not. K. could only see that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and was pressing himself against her. But it was not her who was screaming, but the man, he had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling. A small circle had formed around the two of them, the visitors near him in the gallery seemed delighted that the serious tone K. had introduced into the gathering had been disturbed in this way. K.'s first thought was to run over there, and he also thought that everyone would want to bring things back into order there or at least to make the pair leave the room, but the first row of people in from of him stayed were they were, no-one moved and no-one let K. through. On the contrary, they stood in his way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand from somewhere - he did not have the time to turn round - took hold of his collar. K., by this time, had forgotten about the pair, it seemed to him that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being taken seriously, and, without any thought for what he was doing, he jumped down from the podium. Now he stood face to face with the crowd. Had he judged the people properly? Had he put too much faith in the effect of his speech? Had they been putting up a pretence all the time he had been speaking, and now that he come to the end and to what must follow, were they tired of pretending? What faces they were, all around him! Dark, little eyes flickered here and there, cheeks drooped down like on drunken men, their long beards were thin and stiff, if they took hold of them it was more like they were making their hands into claws, not as if they were taking hold of their own beards. But underneath those beards - and this was the real discovery made by K. - there were badges of various sizes and colours shining on the collars of their coats. As far as he could see, every one of them was wearing one of these badges. All of them belonged to the same group, even though they seemed to be divided to the right and the left of him, and when he suddenly turned round he saw the same badge on the collar of the examining judge who calmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap. ""So,"" called out K, throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden realisation needed more room, ""all of you are working for this organisation, I see now that you are all the very bunch of cheats and liars I've just been speaking about, you've all pressed yourselves in here in order to listen in and snoop on me, you gave the impression of having formed into factions, one of you even applauded me to test me out, and you wanted to learn how to trap an innocent man! Well, I hope you haven't come here for nothing, I hope you've either had some fun from someone who expected you to defend his innocence or else - let go of me or I'll hit you,"" shouted K. to a quivery old man who had pressed himself especially close to him - ""or else that you've actually learned something. And so I wish you good luck in your trade."" He briskly took his hat from where it lay on the edge of the table and, surrounded by a silence caused perhaps by the completeness of their surprise, pushed his way to the exit. However, the examining judge seems to have moved even more quickly than K., as he was waiting for him at the doorway. ""One moment,"" he said. K. stood where he was, but looked at the door with his hand already on its handle rather than at the judge. ""I merely wanted to draw your attention, "" said the judge, ""to something you seem not yet to be aware of: today, you have robbed yourself of the advantages that a",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,22,"hearing of this sort always gives to someone who is under arrest."" K. laughed towards the door. ""You bunch of louts,"" he called, ""you can keep all your hearings as a present from me,"" then opened the door and hurried down the steps. Behind him, the noise of the assembly rose as it became lively once more and probably began to discuss these events as if making a scientific study of them. Chapter Three In the empty Courtroom - The Student - The Offices Every day over the following week, K. expected another summons to arrive, he could not believe that his rejection of any more hearings had been taken literally, and when the expected summons really had not come by Saturday evening he took it to mean that he was expected, without being told, to appear at the same place at the same time. So on Sunday, he set out once more in the same direction, going without hesitation up the steps and through the corridors; some of the people remembered him and greeted him from their doorways, but he no longer needed to ask anyone the way and soon arrived at the right door. It was opened as soon as he knocked and, paying no attention to the woman he had seen last time who was standing at the doorway, he was about to go straight into the adjoining room when she said to him ""There's no session today"". ""What do you mean; no session?"" he asked, unable to believe it. But the woman persuaded him by opening the door to the next room. It was indeed empty, and looked even more dismal empty than it had the previous Sunday. On the podium stood the table exactly as it had been before with a few books laying on it. ""Can I have a look at those books?"" asked K., not because he was especially curious but so that he would not have come for nothing. ""No,"" said the woman as she re-closed the door, ""that's not allowed. Those books belong to the examining judge."" ""I see,"" said K., and nodded, ""those books must be law books, and that's how this court does things, not only to try people who are innocent but even to try them without letting them know what's going on."" ""I expect you're right,"" said the woman, who had not understood exactly what he meant. ""I'd better go away again, then,"" said K. ""Should I give a message to the examining judge?"" asked the woman. ""Do you know him, then?"" asked K. ""Of course I know him,"" said the woman, ""my husband is the court usher."" It was only now that K. noticed that the room, which before had held nothing but a wash-tub, had been fitted out as a living room. The woman saw how surprised he was and said, ""Yes, we're allowed to live here as we like, only we have to clear the room out when the court's in session. There's lots of disadvantages to my husband's job."" ""It's not so much the room that surprises me,"" said K., looking at her crossly, ""it's your being married that shocks me."" ""Are you thinking about what happened last time the court was in session, when I disturbed what you were saying?"" asked the woman. ""Of course,"" said K., ""it's in the past now and I've nearly forgotten about it, but at the time it made me furious. And now you tell me yourself that you are a married woman."" ""It wasn't any disadvantage for you to have your speech interrupted. The way they talked about you after you'd gone was really bad."" ""That could well be,"" said K., turning away, ""but it does not excuse you."" ""There's no-one I know who'd hold it against me,"" said the woman. ""Him, who put his arms around me, he's been chasing after me for a long time. I might not be very attractive for most people, but I am for him. I've got no protection from him, even my husband has had to get used to it; if he wants to keep his job he's got to put up with it as that man's a student and he'll almost certainly be very powerful later on. He's always after me, he'd only just left when you arrived."" ""That fits in with everything else,"" said K., ""I'm not surprised."" ""Do you want to make things a bit better here?"" the woman asked slowly, watching him as if she were saying something that could be as dangerous for K. as for herself. ""That's what I thought when I heard you speak, I really liked what you said. Mind you, I only heard part of it, I missed the beginning of it and at the end I was lying on",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,23,"the floor with the student. - it's so horrible here,"" she said after a pause, and took hold of K.'s hand. ""Do you believe you really will be able to make things better?"" K. smiled and twisted his hand round a little in her soft hands. ""It's really not my job to make things better here, as you put it,"" he said, ""and if you said that to the examining judge he would laugh at you or punish you for it. I really would not have become involved in this matter if I could have helped it, and I would have lost no sleep worrying about how this court needs to be made better. But because I'm told that I have been arrested - and I am under arrest - it forces me to take some action, and to do so for my own sake. However, if I can be of some service to you in the process I will, of course, be glad to do so. And I will be glad to do so not only for the sake of charity but also because you can be of some help to me."" ""How could I help you, then?"" said the woman. ""You could, for example, show me the books on the table there."" ""Yes, certainly,"" the woman cried, and pulled K. along behind her as she rushed to them. The books were old and well worn, the cover of one of them had nearly broken through in its middle, and it was held together with a few threads. ""Everything is so dirty here,"" said K., shaking his head, and before he could pick the books up the woman wiped some of the dust off with her apron. K. took hold of the book that lay on top and threw it open, an indecent picture appeared. A man and a woman sat naked on a sofa, the base intent of whoever drew it was easy to see but he had been so grossly lacking in skill that all that anyone could really make out were the man and the woman who dominated the picture with their bodies, sitting in overly upright postures that created a false perspective and made it difficult for them to approach each other. K. didn't thumb through that book any more, but just threw open the next one at its title page, it was a novel with the title, What Grete Suffered from her Husband, Hans. ""So this is the sort of law book they study here,"" said K., ""this is the sort of person sitting in judgement over me."" ""I can help you,"" said the woman, ""would you like me to?"" ""Could you really do that without placing yourself in danger? You did say earlier on that your husband is wholly dependent on his superiors."" ""I still want to help you,"" said the woman, ""come over here, we've got to talk about it. Don't say any more about what danger I'm in, I only fear danger where I want to fear it. Come over here."" She pointed to the podium and invited him to sit down on the step with her. ""You've got lovely dark eyes,"" she said after they had sat down, looking up into K.'s face, ""people say I've got nice eyes too, but yours are much nicer. It was the first thing I noticed when you first came here. That's even why I came in here, into the assembly room, afterwards, I'd never normally do that, I'm not really even allowed to."" So that's what all this is about, thought K., she's offering herself to me, she's as degenerate as everything else around here, she's had enough of the court officials, which is understandable I suppose, and so she approaches any stranger and makes compliments about his eyes. With that, K. stood up in silence as if he had spoken his thoughts out loud and thus explained his action to the woman. ""I don't think you can be of any assistance to me,"" he said, ""to be of any real assistance you would need to be in contact with high officials. But I'm sure you only know the lower employees, and there are crowds of them milling about here. I'm sure you're very familiar with them and could achieve a great deal through them, I've no doubt of that, but the most that could be done through them would have no bearing at all on the final outcome of the trial. You, on the other hand, would lose some of your friends as a result, and I have no wish of that. Carry on with these people in the same way as you have been, as it does seem to me to be something you cannot do without. I have no regrets",no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,24,"in saying this as, in return for your compliment to me, I also find you rather attractive, especially when you look at me as sadly as you are now, although you really have no reason to do so. You belong to the people I have to combat, and you're very comfortable among them, you're even in love with the student, or if you don't love him you do at least prefer him to your husband. It's easy to see that from what you've been saying."" ""No!"" she shouted, remained sitting where she was and grasped K.'s hand, which he failed to pull away fast enough. ""You can't go away now, you can't go away when you've misjudged me like that! Are you really capable of going away now? Am I really so worthless that you won't even do me the favour of staying a little bit longer?"" ""You misunderstand me,"" said K., sitting back down, ""if it's really important to you for me to stay here then I'll be glad to do so, I have plenty of time, I came here thinking there would be a trial taking place. All I meant with what I said just now was to ask you not to do anything on my behalf in the proceedings against me. But even that is nothing for you to worry about when you consider that there's nothing hanging on the outcome of this trial, and that, whatever the verdict, I will just laugh at it. And that's even presupposing it ever even reaches any conclusion, which I very much doubt. I think it's much more likely that the court officials will be too lazy, too forgetful, or even to fearful ever to continue with these proceedings and that they will soon be abandoned if they haven't been abandoned already. It's even possible that they will pretend to be carrying on with the trial in the hope of receiving a large bribe, although I can tell you now that that will be quite in vain as I pay bribes to no-one. Perhaps one favour you could do me would be to tell the examining judge, or anyone else who likes to spread important news, that I will never be induced to pay any sort of bribe through any stratagem of theirs - and I'm sure they have many stratagems at their disposal. There is no prospect of that, you can tell them that quite openly. And what's more, I expect they have already noticed themselves, or even if they haven't, this affair is really not so important to me as they think. Those gentlemen would only save some work for themselves, or at least some unpleasantness for me, which, however, I am glad to endure if I know that each piece of unpleasantness for me is a blow against them. And I will make quite sure it is a blow against them. Do you actually know the judge?"" ""Course I do,"" said the woman, ""he was the first one I thought of when I offered to help you. I didn't know he's only a minor official, but if you say so it must be true. Mind you, I still think the report he gives to his superiors must have some influence. And he writes so many reports. You say these officials are lazy, but they're certainly not all lazy, especially this examining judge, he writes ever such a lot. Last Sunday, for instance, that session went on till the evening. Everyone had gone, but the examining judge, he stayed in the hall, I had to bring him a lamp in, all I had was a little kitchen lamp but he was very satisfied with it and started to write straight away. Meantime my husband arrived, he always has the day off on Sundays, we got the furniture back in and got our room sorted out and then a few of the neighbours came, we sat and talked for a bit by a candle, in short, we forgot all about the examining judge and went to bed. All of a sudden in the night, it must have been quite late in the night, I wakes up, next to the bed, there's the examining judge shading the lamp with his hand so that there's no light from it falls on my husband, he didn't need to be as careful as that, the way my husband sleeps the light wouldn't have woken him up anyway. I was quite shocked and nearly screamed, but the judge was very friendly, warned me I should be careful, he whispered to me he's been writing all this time, and now he's brought me the lamp back, and he'll never forget how I looked when he found me there asleep. What I mean, with all this,",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,25,"I just wanted to tell you how the examining judge really does write lots of reports, especially about you as questioning you was definitely one of the main things on the agenda that Sunday. If he writes reports as long as that they must be of some importance. And besides all that, you can see from what happened that the examining judge is after me, and it's right now, when he's first begun to notice me, that I can have a lot of influence on him. And I've got other proof I mean a lot to him, too. Yesterday, he sent that student to me, the one he really trusts and who he works with, he sent him with a present for me, silk stockings. He said it was because I clear up in the courtroom but that's only a pretence, that job's no more than what I'm supposed to do, it's what my husband gets paid for. Nice stockings, they are, look,"" - she stretched out her leg, drew her skirt up to her knee and looked, herself, at the stocking - ""they are nice stockings, but they're too good for me, really."" She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on K.'s as if she wanted to calm him down, and whispered, ""Be quiet, Berthold is watching us."" K. slowly looked up. In the doorway to the courtroom stood a young man, he was short, his legs were not quite straight, and he continually moved his finger round in a short, thin, red beard with which he hoped to make himself look dignified. K. looked at him with some curiosity, he was the first student he had ever met of the unfamiliar discipline of jurisprudence, face to face at least, a man who would even most likely attain high office one day. The student, in contrast, seemed to take no notice of K. at all, he merely withdrew his finger from his beard long enough to beckon to the woman and went over to the window, the woman leant over to K. and whispered, ""Don't be cross with me, please don't, and please don't think ill of me either, I've got to go to him now, to this horrible man, just look at his bent legs. But I'll come straight back and then I'll go with you if you'll take me, I'll go wherever you want, you can do whatever you like with me, I'll be happy if I can be away from here for as long as possible, it'd be best if I could get away from here for good."" She stroked K.'s hand once more, jumped up and ran over to the window. Before he realised it, K. grasped for her hand but failed to catch it. He really was attracted to the woman, and even after thinking hard about it could find no good reason why he should not give in to her allure. It briefly crossed his mind that the woman meant to entrap him on behalf of the court, but that was an objection he had no difficulty in fending off. In what way could she entrap him? Was he not still free, so free that he could crush the entire court whenever he wanted, as least where it concerned him? Could he not have that much confidence in himself? And her offer of help sounded sincere, and maybe it wasn't quite worthless. And maybe there was no better revenge against the examining judge and his cronies than to take this woman from him and have her for himself. Maybe then, after much hard work writing dishonest reports about K., the judge would go to the woman's bed late one night and find it empty. And it would be empty because she belonged to K., because this woman at the window, this lush, supple, warm body in its sombre clothes of rough, heavy material belonged to him, totally to him and to him alone. Once he had settled his thoughts towards the woman in this way, he began to find the quiet conversation at the window was taking too long, he rapped on the podium with his knuckles, and then even with his fist. The student briefly looked away from the woman to glance at K. over his shoulder but did allow himself to be disturbed, in fact he even pressed himself close to the woman and put his arms around her. She dropped her head down low as if listening to him carefully, as she did so he kissed her right on the neck, hardly even interrupting what he was saying. K. saw this as confirmation of the tyranny the student held over the woman and which she had already complained about, he stood up and walked up and down the room.",no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,26,"Glancing sideways at the student, he wondered what would be the quickest possible way to get rid of him, and so it was not unwelcome to him when the student, clearly disturbed by K.'s to-ing and fro-ing which K. had now developed into a stamping up and down, said to him, ""You don't have to stay here, you know, if you're getting impatient. You could have gone earlier, no-one would have missed you. In fact you should have gone, you should have left as quickly as possible as soon as I got here."" This comment could have caused all possible rage to break out between them, but K. also bore in mind that this was a prospective court official speaking to a disfavoured defendant, and he might well have been taking pride in speaking in this way. K. remained standing quite close to him and said with a smile, ""You're quite right, I am impatient, but the easiest way to settle this impatience would be if you left us. On the other hand, if you've come here to study - you are a student, I hear - I'll be quite happy to leave the room to you and go away with the woman. I'm sure you'll still have a lot of study to do before you're made into a judge. It's true that I'm still not all that familiar with your branch of jurisprudence but I take it it involves a lot more than speaking roughly - and I see you have no shame in doing that extremely well."" ""He shouldn't have been allowed to move about so freely,"" said the student, as if he wanted to give the woman an explanation for K.'s insults, ""that was a mistake. I've told the examining judge so. He should at least have been detained in his room between hearings. Sometimes it's impossible to understand what the judge thinks he's doing."" ""You're wasting your breath,"" said K., then he reached his hand out towards the woman and said, ""come with me."" ""So that's it,"" said the student, ""oh no, you're not going to get her,"" and with a strength you would not have expected from him, he glanced tenderly at her, lifted her up on one arm and, his back bent under the weight, ran with her to the door. In this way he showed, unmistakeably, that he was to some extent afraid of K., but he nonetheless dared to provoke him still further by stroking and squeezing the woman's arm with his free hand. K. ran the few steps up to him, but when he had reached him and was about to take hold of him and, if necessary, throttle him, the woman said, ""It's no good, it's the examining judge who's sent for me, I daren't go with you, this little bastard... "" and here she ran her hand over the student's face, ""this little bastard won't let me."" ""And you don't want to be set free!"" shouted K., laying his hand on the student's shoulder, who then snapped at it with his teeth. ""No!"" shouted the woman, pushing K. away with both hands, ""no, no don't do that, what d'you think you're doing!? That'd be the end of me. Let go of him, please just let go of him. He's only carrying out the judge's orders, he's carrying me to him."" ""Let him take you then, and I want to see nothing more of you,"" said K., enraged by his disappointment and giving the student a thump in the back so that he briefly stumbled and then, glad that he had not fallen, immediately jumped up all the higher with his burden. K. followed them slowly. He realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he had suffered from these people. It was of course nothing to worry about, he accepted the setback only because he was looking for a fight. If he stayed at home and carried on with his normal life he would be a thousand times superior to these people and could get any of them out of his way just with a kick. And he imagined the most laughable scene possible as an example of this, if this contemptible student, this inflated child, this knock-kneed redbeard, if he were kneeling at Elsa's bed wringing his hands and begging for forgiveness. K. so enjoyed imagining this scene that he decided to take the student along to Elsa with him if ever he should get the opportunity. K. was curious to see where the woman would be taken and he hurried over to the door, the student was not likely to carry her through the streets on his arm. It turned out that the journey was far shorter. Directly opposite the flat there was a narrow flight of",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,27,"wooden steps which probably led up to the attic, they turned as they went so that it was not possible to see where they ended. The student carried the woman up these steps, and after the exertions of running with her he was soon groaning and moving very slowly. The woman waved down at K. and by raising and lowering her shoulders she tried to show that she was an innocent party in this abduction, although the gesture did not show a lot of regret. K. watched her without expression like a stranger, he wanted to show neither that he was disappointed nor that he would easily get over his disappointment. The two of them had disappeared, but K. remained standing in the doorway. He had to accept that the woman had not only cheated him but that she had also lied to him when she said she was being taken to the examining judge. The examining judge certainly wouldn't be sitting and waiting in the attic. The wooden stairs would explain nothing to him however long he stared at them. Then K. noticed a small piece of paper next to them, went across to it and read, in a childish and unpractised hand, ""Entrance to the Court Offices"". Were the court offices here, in the attic of this tenement, then? If that was how they were accommodated it did not attract much respect, and it was some comfort for the accused to realise how little money this court had at its disposal if it had to locate its offices in a place where the tenants of the building, who were themselves among the poorest of people, would throw their unneeded junk. On the other hand, it was possible that the officials had enough money but that they squandered it on themselves rather than use it for the court's purposes. Going by K.'s experience of them so far, that even seemed probable, except that if the court were allowed to decay in that way it would not just humiliate the accused but also give him more encouragement than if the court were simply in a state of poverty. K. also now understood that the court was ashamed to summon those it accused to the attic of this building for the initial hearing, and why it preferred to impose upon them in their own homes. What a position it was that K. found himself in, compared with the judge sitting up in the attic! K., at the bank, had a big office with an ante-room, and had an enormous window through which he could look down at the activity in the square. It was true, though, that he had no secondary income from bribes and fraud, and he couldn't tell a servant to bring him a woman up to the office on his arm. K., however, was quite willing to do without such things, in this life at least. K. was still looking at the notice when a man came up the stairs, looked through the open door into the living room where it was also possible to see the courtroom, and finally asked K. whether he had just seen a woman there. ""You're the court usher, aren't you?"" asked K. ""That's right,"" said the man, ""oh, yes, you're defendant K., I recognise you now as well. Nice to see you here."" And he offered K. his hand, which was far from what K. had expected. And when K. said nothing, he added, ""There's no court session planned for today, though."" ""I know that,"" said K. as he looked at the usher's civilian coat which, beside its ordinary buttons, displayed two gilded ones as the only sign of his office and seemed to have been taken from an old army officer's coat. ""I was speaking with your wife a little while ago. She is no longer here. The student has carried her off to the examining judge."" ""Listen to this,"" said the usher, ""they're always carrying her away from me. It's Sunday today, and it's not part of my job to do any work today, but they send me off with some message which isn't even necessary just to get me away from here. What they do is they send me off not too far away so that I can still hope to get back on time if I really hurry. So off I go running as fast as I can, shout the message through the crack in the door of the office I've been sent to, so out of breath they'll hardly be able to understand it, run back here again, but the student's been even faster than I have - well he's got less far to go, he's only got to run down the steps. If I wasn't so",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,28,"dependent on them I'd have squashed the student against the wall here a long time ago. Right here, next to the sign. I'm always dreaming of doing that. Just here, just above the floor, that's where he's crushed onto the wall, his arms stretched out, his fingers spread apart, his crooked legs twisted round into a circle and blood squirted out all around him. It's only ever been a dream so far, though."" ""Is there nothing else you do?"" asked K. with a smile. ""Nothing that I know of,"" said the usher. ""And it's going to get even worse now, up till now he's only been carrying her off for himself, now he's started carrying her off for the judge and all, just like I'd always said he would."" ""Does your wife, then, not share some of the responsibility?"" asked K. He had to force himself as he asked this question, as he, too, felt so jealous now. ""Course she does,"" said the usher, ""it's more her fault than theirs. It was her who attached herself to him. All he did, he just chases after any woman. There's five flats in this block alone where he's been thrown out after working his way in there. And my wife is the best looking woman in the whole building, but it's me who's not even allowed to defend himself."" ""If that's how things are, then there's nothing that can be done,"" said K. ""Well why not?"" asked the usher. ""He's a coward that student, if he wants to lay a finger on my wife all you'd have to do is give him such a good hiding he'd never dare do it again. But I'm not allowed to do that, and nobody else is going to do me the favour as they're all afraid of his power. The only one who could do it is a man like you."" ""What, how could I do it?"" asked K. in astonishment. ""Well you're facing a charge, aren't you,"" said the usher. ""Yes, but that's all the more reason for me to be afraid. Even if he has no influence on the outcome of the trial he probably has some on the initial examination."" ""Yes, exactly,"" said the usher, as if K.'s view had been just as correct as his own. ""Only we don't usually get any trials heard here with no hope at all."" ""I am not of the same opinion"", said K., ""although that ought not to prevent me from dealing with the student if the opportunity arises."" ""I would be very grateful to you,"" said the usher of the court, somewhat formally, not really seeming to believe that his highest wish could be fulfilled. ""Perhaps,"" continued K., ""perhaps there are some other officials of yours here, perhaps all of them, who would deserve the same."" ""Oh yes, yes,"" said the usher, as if this was a matter of course. Then he looked at K. trustingly which, despite all his friendliness, he had not done until then, and added, ""they're always rebelling."" But the conversation seemed to have become a little uncomfortable for him, as he broke it off by saying, ""now I have to report to the office. Would you like to come with me?"" ""There's nothing for me to do there,"" said K. ""You'd be able to have a look at it. No-one will take any notice of you."" ""Is it worth seeing then?"" asked K. hesitatingly, although he felt very keen to go with him. ""Well,"" said the usher, ""I thought you'd be interested in it."" ""Alright then,"" said K. finally, ""I'll come with you."" And, quicker than the usher himself, he ran up the steps. At the entrance he nearly fell over, as behind the door there was another step. ""They don't show much concern for the public,"" he said. ""They don't show any concern at all,"" said the usher, ""just look at the waiting room here."" It consisted of a long corridor from which roughly made doors led out to the separate departments of the attic. There was no direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the departments, instead of solid walls, had just wooden bars reaching up to the ceiling to separate them from the corridor. The light made its way in through them, and it was also possible to see individual officials through them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at the wooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through the gaps. There were only a few people in the corridor, probably because it was Sunday. They were not very impressive. They sat, equally spaced, on two rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along both sides of the corridor. All of them",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,29,"were carelessly dressed although the expressions on their faces, their bearing, the style of their beards and many details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to the upper classes. There were no coat hooks for them to use, and so they had placed their hats under the bench, each probably having followed the example of the others. When those who were sitting nearest the door saw K. and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them, and when the others saw that, they also thought they had to greet them, so that as the two of them went by all the people there stood up. None of them stood properly upright, their backs were bowed, their knees bent, they stood like beggars on the street. K. waited for the usher, who was following just behind him. ""They must all be very dispirited,"" he said. ""Yes,"" said the usher, ""they are the accused, everyone you see here has been accused."" ""Really!"" said K. ""They're colleagues of mine then."" And he turned to the nearest one, a tall, thin man with hair that was nearly grey. ""What is it you are waiting for here?"" asked K., politely, but the man was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly, which was all the more pitiful to see because the man clearly had some experience of the world and elsewhere would certainly have been able to show his superiority and would not have easily given up the advantage he had acquired. Here, though, he did not know what answer to give to such a simple question and looked round at the others as if they were under some obligation to help him, and as if no-one could expect any answer from him without this help. Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and, in order to calm him down and raise his spirits, said, ""The gentleman here's only asking what it is you're waiting for. You can give him an answer."" The voice of the usher was probably familiar to him, and had a better effect than K.'s. ""I'm ... I'm waiting ..."" he began, and then came to a halt. He had clearly chosen this beginning so that he could give a precise answer to the question, but now he didn't know how to continue. Some of the others waiting had come closer and stood round the group, the usher of the court said to them, ""Get out the way, keep the gangway free."" They moved back slightly, but not as far as where they had been sitting before. In the meantime, the man whom K. had first approached had pulled himself together and even answered him with a smile. ""A month ago I made some applications for evidence to be heard in my case, and I'm waiting for it to be settled."" ""You certainly seem to be going to a lot of effort,"" said K. ""Yes,"" said the man, ""it is my affair after all."" ""Not everyone thinks the same way as you do,"" said K. ""I've been indicted as well but I swear on my soul that I've neither submitted evidence nor done anything else of the sort. Do you really think that's necessary?"" ""I don't really know, exactly,"" said the man, once more totally unsure of himself; he clearly thought K. was joking with him and therefore probably thought it best to repeat his earlier answer in order to avoid making any new mistakes. With K. looking at him impatiently, he just said, ""as far as I'm concerned, I've applied to have this evidence heard."" ""Perhaps you don't believe I've been indicted?"" asked K. ""Oh, please, I certainly do,"" said the man, stepping slightly to one side, but there was more anxiety in his answer than belief. ""You don't believe me then?"" asked K., and took hold of his arm, unconsciously prompted by the man's humble demeanour, and as if he wanted to force him to believe him. But he did not want to hurt the man and had only taken hold of him very lightly. Nonetheless, the man cried out as if K. had grasped him not with two fingers but with red hot tongs. Shouting in this ridiculous way finally made K. tired of him, if he didn't believe he was indicted then so much the better; maybe he even thought K. was a judge. And before leaving, he held him a lot harder, shoved him back onto the bench and walked on. ""These defendants are so sensitive, most of them,"" said the usher of the court. Almost all of those who had been waiting had now assembled around the man who, by now, had stopped shouted and they seemed to be asking him lots of precise questions about the",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,30,"incident. K. was approached by a security guard, identifiable mainly by his sword, of which the scabbard seemed to be made of aluminium. This greatly surprised K., and he reached out for it with his hand. The guard had come because of the shouting and asked what had been happening. The usher of the court said a few words to try and calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into it himself, saluted, and hurried on, walking with very short steps, probably because of gout. K. didn't concern himself long with the guard or these people, especially as he saw a turning off the corridor, about half way along it on the right hand side, where there was no door to stop him going that way. He asked the usher whether that was the right way to go, the usher nodded, and that is the way that K. went. The usher remained always one or two steps behind K, which he found irritating as in a place like this it could give the impression that he was being driven along by someone who had arrested him, so he frequently waited for the usher to catch up, but the usher always remained behind him. In order to put an end to his discomfort, K. finally said, ""Now that I've seen what it looks like here, I'd like to go."" ""You haven't seen everything yet,"" said the usher ingenuously. ""I don't want to see everything,"" said K., who was also feeling very tired, ""I want to go, what is the way to the exit?"" ""You haven't got lost, have you?"" asked the usher in amazement, ""you go down this way to the corner, then right down the corridor straight ahead as far as the door."" ""Come with me,"" said K., ""show me the way, I'll miss it, there are so many different ways here."" ""It's the only way there is,"" said the usher, who had now started to sound quite reproachful, ""I can't go back with you again, I've got to hand in my report, and I've already lost a lot of time because of you as it is."" ""Come with me!"" K. repeated, now somewhat sharper as if he had finally caught the usher out in a lie. ""Don't shout like that,"" whispered the usher, ""there's offices all round us here. If you don't want to go back by yourself come on a bit further with me or else wait here till I've sorted out my report, then I'll be glad to go back with you again."" ""No, no,"" said K., ""I will not wait and you must come with me now."" K. had still not looked round at anything at all in the room where he found himself, and it was only when one of the many wooden doors all around him opened that he noticed it. A young woman, probably summoned by the loudness of K.'s voice, entered and asked, ""What is it the gentleman wants?"" In the darkness behind her there was also a man approaching. K. looked at the usher. He had, after all, said that no-one would take any notice of K., and now there were two people coming, it only needed a few and everyone in the office would become aware of him and asking for explanations as to why he was there. The only understandable and acceptable thing to say was that he was accused of something and wanted to know the date of his next hearing, but this was an explanation he did not want to give, especially as it was not true - he had only come out of curiosity. Or else, an explanation even less usable, he could say that he wanted to ascertain that the court was as revolting on the inside as it was on the outside. And it did seem that he had been quite right in this supposition, he had no wish to intrude any deeper, he was disturbed enough by what he had seen already, he was not in the right frame of mind just then to face a high official such as might appear from behind any door, and he wanted to go, either with the usher of the court or, if needs be, alone. But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, and the young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they thought he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which they didn't want to miss seeing. And in the doorway stood the man whom K. had noticed in the background earlier, he held firmly on to the beam above the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if becoming impatient as he watched.",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,31,"But the young woman was the first to recognise that K.'s behaviour was caused by his feeling slightly unwell, she brought a chair and asked, ""Would you not like to sit down?"" K. sat down immediately and, in order to keep his place better, put his elbows on the armrests. ""You're a little bit dizzy, aren't you?"" she asked him. Her face was now close in front of him, it bore the severe expression that many young women have just when they're in the bloom of their youth. ""It's nothing for you to worry about,"" she said, ""that's nothing unusual here, almost everyone gets an attack like that the first time they come here. This is your first time is it? Yes, it's nothing unusual then. The sun burns down on the roof and the hot wood makes the air so thick and heavy. It makes this place rather unsuitable for offices, whatever other advantages it might offer. But the air is almost impossible to breathe on days when there's a lot of business, and that's almost every day. And when you think that there's a lot of washing put out to dry here as well - and we can't stop the tenants doing that - it's not surprising you started to feel unwell. But you get used to the air alright in the end. When you're here for the second or third time you'll hardly notice how oppressive the air is. Are you feeling any better now?"" K. made no answer, he felt too embarrassed at being put at the mercy of these people by his sudden weakness, and learning the reason for feeling ill made him feel not better but a little worse. The girl noticed it straight away, and to make the air fresher for K., she took a window pole that was leaning against the wall and pushed open a small hatch directly above K.'s head that led to the outside. But so much soot fell in that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean the soot off K.'s hands with her handkerchief, as K. was too tired to do that for himself. He would have liked just to sit quietly where he was until he had enough strength to leave, and the less fuss people made about him the sooner that would be. But then the girl said, ""You can't stay here, we're in people's way here ..."" K. looked at her as if to ask whose way they were impeding. ""If you like, I can take you to the sick room,"" and turning to the man in the doorway said, ""please help me"". The man immediately came over to them, but K. did not want to go to the sick room, that was just what he wanted to avoid, being led further from place to place, the further he went the more difficult it must become. So he said, ""I am able to walk now,"" and stood up, shaking after becoming used to sitting so comfortably. But then he was unable to stay upright. ""I can't manage it,"" he said shaking his head, and sat down again with a sigh. He remembered the usher who, despite everything, would have been able to lead him out of there but who seemed to have gone long before. K. looked out between the man and the young woman who were standing in front of him but was unable to find the usher. ""I think,"" said the man, who was elegantly dressed and whose appearance was made especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that had two long, sharply tailored points, ""the gentleman is feeling unwell because of the atmosphere here, so the best thing, and what he would most prefer, would be not to take him to the sick room but get him out of the offices altogether."" ""That's right,"" exclaimed K., with such joy that he nearly interrupted what the man was saying, ""I'm sure that'll make me feel better straight away, I'm really not that weak, all I need is a little support under my arms, I won't cause you much trouble, it's not such a long way anyway, lead me to the door and then I'll sit on the stairs for a while and soon recover, as I don't suffer from attacks like this at all, I'm surprised at it myself. I also work in an office and I'm quite used to office air, but here it seems to be too strong, you've said so yourselves. So please, be so kind as to help me on my way a little, I'm feeling dizzy, you see, and it'll make me ill if I stand up by myself."" And with that he raised his shoulders to make it easier for the two of",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,32,"them to take him by the arms. The man, however, didn't follow this suggestion but just stood there with his hands in his trouser pockets and laughed out loud. ""There, you see,"" he said to the girl, ""I was quite right. The gentleman is only unwell here, and not in general."" The young woman smiled too, but lightly tapped the man's arm with the tips of her fingers as if he had allowed himself too much fun with K. ""So what do you think, then?"" said the man, still laughing, ""I really do want to lead the gentleman out of here."" ""That's alright, then,"" said the girl, briefly inclining her charming head. ""Don't worry too much about him laughing,"" said the girl to K., who had become unhappy once more and stared quietly in front of himself as if needing no further explanation. ""This gentleman - may I introduce you?"" - (the man gave his permission with a wave of the hand) - ""so, this gentleman's job is to give out information. He gives all the information they need to people who are waiting, as our court and its offices are not very well known among the public he gets asked for quite a lot. He has an answer for every question, you can try him out if you feel like it. But that's not his only distinction, his other distinction is his elegance of dress. We, that's to say all of us who work in the offices here, we decided that the information- giver would have to be elegantly dressed as he continually has to deal with the litigants and he's the first one they meet, so he needs to give a dignified first impression. The rest of us I'm afraid, as you can see just by looking at me, dress very badly and old-fashioned; and there's not much point in spending much on clothes anyway, as we hardly ever leave the offices, we even sleep here. But, as I said, we decided that the information-giver would have to have nice clothes. As the management here is rather peculiar in this respect, and they would get them for us, we had a collection - some of the litigants contributed too - and bought him these lovely clothes and some others besides. So everything would be ready for him to give a good impression, except that he spoils it again by laughing and frightening people."" ""That's how it is,"" said the man, mocking her, ""but I don't understand why it is that you're explaining all our intimate facts to the gentleman, or rather why it is that you're pressing them on him, as I'm sure he's not all interested. Just look at him sitting there, it's clear he's occupied with his own affairs."" K. just did not feel like contradicting him.. The girl's intention may have been good, perhaps she was under instructions to distract him or to give him the chance to collect himself, but the attempt had not worked. ""I had to explain to him why you were laughing,"" said the girl. ""I suppose it was insulting."" ""I think he would forgive even worse insults if I finally took him outside."" K. said nothing, did not even look up, he tolerated the two of them negotiating over him like an object, that was even what suited him best. But suddenly he felt the information-giver's hand on one arm and the young woman's hand on the other. ""Up you get then, weakling,"" said the information-giver. ""Thank you both very much,"" said K., pleasantly surprised, as he slowly rose and personally guided these unfamiliar hands to the places where he most needed support. As they approached the corridor, the girl said quietly into K.'s ear, ""I must seem to think it's very important to show the information-giver in a good light, but you shouldn't doubt what I say, I just want to say the truth. He isn't hard-hearted. It's not really his job to help litigants outside if they're unwell but he's doing it anyway, as you can see. I don't suppose any of us is hard-hearted, perhaps we'd all like to be helpful, but working for the court offices it's easy for us to give the impression we are hard-hearted and don't want to help anyone. It makes me quite sad."" ""Would you not like to sit down here a while?"" asked the information-giver, there were already in the corridor and just in front of the defendant whom K. had spoken to earlier. K. felt almost ashamed to be seen by him, earlier he had stood so upright in front of him and now he had to be supported by two others, his hat was held up by the information-giver balanced on outstretched fingers, his hair was dishevelled and",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,33,"hung down onto the sweat on his forehead. But the defendant seemed to notice nothing of what was going on and just stood there humbly, as if wanting to apologise to the information-giver for being there. The information-giver looked past him. ""I know,"" he said, ""that my case can't be settled today, not yet, but I've come in anyway, I thought, I thought I could wait here anyway, it's Sunday today, I've got plenty of time, and I'm not disturbing anyone here."" ""There's no need to be so apologetic,"" said the information-giver, ""it's very commendable for you to be so attentive. You are taking up space here when you don't need to but as long as you don't get in my way I will do nothing to stop you following the progress of your case as closely as you like. When one has seen so many people who shamefully neglect their cases one learns to show patience with people like you. Do sit down."" ""He's very good with the litigants,"" whispered the girl. K. nodded, but started to move off again when the information-giver repeated, ""Would you not like to sit down here a while?"" ""No, ""said K., ""I don't want to rest."" He had said that with as decisively as he could, but in fact it would have done him a lot of good to sit down. It was as if he were suffering sea-sickness. He felt as if he were on a ship in a rough sea, as if the water were hitting against the wooden walls, a thundering from the depths of the corridor as if the torrent were crashing over it, as if the corridor were swaying and the waiting litigants on each side of it rising and sinking. It made the calmness of the girl and the man leading him all the more incomprehensible. He was at their mercy, if they let go of him he would fall like a board. Their little eyes glanced here and there, K. could feel the evenness of their steps but could not do the same, as from step to step he was virtually being carried. He finally noticed they were speaking to him but he did not understand them, all he heard was a noise that filled all the space and through which there seemed to be an unchanging higher note sounding, like a siren. ""Louder,"" he whispered with his head sunk low, ashamed at having to ask them to speak louder when he knew they had spoken loudly enough, even if it had been, for him, incomprehensible. At last, a draught of cool air blew in his face as if a gap had been torn out in the wall in front of him, and next to him he heard someone say, ""First he says he wants to go, and then you can tell him a hundred times that this is the way out and he doesn't move."" K. became aware that he was standing in front of the way out, and that the young woman had opened the door. It seemed to him that all his strength returned to him at once, and to get a foretaste of freedom he stepped straight on to one of the stairs and took his leave there of his companions, who bowed to him. ""Thank you very much,"" he repeated, shook their hands once more and did not let go until he thought he saw that they found it hard to bear the comparatively fresh air from the stairway after being so long used to the air in the offices. They were hardly able to reply, and the young woman might even have fallen over if K. had not shut the door extremely fast. K. then stood still for a while, combed his hair with the help of a pocket mirror, picked up his hat from the next stair - the information-giver must have thrown it down there - and then he ran down the steps so fresh and in such long leaps that the contrast with his previous state nearly frightened him. His normally sturdy state of health had never prepared him for surprises such as this. Did his body want to revolt and cause him a new trial as he was bearing the old one with such little effort? He did not quite reject the idea that he should see a doctor the next time he had the chance, but whatever he did - and this was something on which he could advise himself - he wanted to spend all Sunday mornings in future better than he had spent this one. Chapter Four Miss Brstner's Friend For some time after this, K. found it impossible to exchange even just a few words with Miss Brstner. He tried to reach",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,34,"her in many and various ways but she always found a way to avoid it. He would come straight home from the office, remain in her room without the light on, and sit on the sofa with nothing more to distract him than keeping watch on the empty hallway. If the maid went by and closed the door of the apparently empty room he would get up after a while and open it again. He got up an hour earlier than usual in the morning so that he might perhaps find Miss Brstner alone as she went to the office. But none of these efforts brought any success. Then he wrote her a letter, both to the office and the flat, attempting once more to justify his behaviour, offered to make whatever amends he could, promised never to cross whatever boundary she might set him and begged merely to have the chance to speak to her some time, especially as he was unable to do anything with Mrs. Grubach either until he had spoken with Miss Brstner, he finally informed her that the following Sunday he would stay in his room all day waiting for a sign from her that there was some hope of his request being fulfilled, or at least that she would explain to him why she could not fulfil it even though he had promised to observe whatever stipulations she might make. The letters were not returned, but there was no answer either. However, on the following Sunday there was a sign that seemed clear enough. It was still early when K. noticed, through the keyhole, that there was an unusual level of activity in the hallway which soon abated. A French teacher, although she was German and called Montag, a pale and febrile girl with a slight limp who had previously occupied a room of her own, was moving into Miss Brstner's room. She could be seen shuffling through the hallway for several hours, there was always another piece of clothing or a blanket or a book that she had forgotten and had to be fetched specially and brought into the new home. When Mrs. Grubach brought K. his breakfast - ever since the time when she had made K. so cross she didn't trust the maid to do the slightest job - he had no choice but to speak to her, for the first time in five days. ""Why is there so much noise in the hallway today?"" he asked as she poured his coffee out, ""Can't something be done about it? Does this clearing out have to be done on a Sunday?"" K. did not look up at Mrs. Grubach, but he saw nonetheless that she seemed to feel some relief as she breathed in. Even sharp questions like this from Mr. K. she perceived as forgiveness, or as the beginning of forgiveness. ""We're not clearing anything out, Mr. K.,"" she said, ""it's just that Miss Montag is moving in with Miss Brstner and is moving her things across."" She said nothing more, but just waited to see how K. would take it and whether he would allow her to carry on speaking. But K. kept her in uncertainty, took the spoon and pensively stirred his coffee while he remained silent. Then he looked up at her and said, ""What about the suspicions you had earlier about Miss Brstner, have you given them up?"" ""Mr. K.,"" called Mrs. Grubach, who had been waiting for this very question, as she put her hands together and held them out towards him. ""I just made a chance remark and you took it so badly. I didn't have the slightest intention of offending anyone, not you or anyone else. You've known me for long enough, Mr. K., I'm sure you're convinced of that. You don't know how I've been suffering for the past few days! That I should tell lies about my tenants! And you, Mr. K., you believed it! And said I should give you notice! Give you notice!"" At this last outcry, Mrs. Grubach was already choking back her tears, she raised her apron to her face and blubbered out loud. ""Oh, don't cry Mrs. Grubach,"" said K., looking out the window, he was thinking only of Miss Brstner and how she was accepting an unknown girl into her room. ""Now don't cry,"" he said again as he turned his look back into the room where Mrs. Grubach was still crying. ""I meant no harm either when I said that. It was simply a misunderstanding between us. That can happen even between old friends sometimes."" Mrs. Grubach pulled her apron down to below her eyes to see whether K. really was attempting a reconciliation. ""Well, yes, that's how it is,"" said K., and as Mrs.",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,35,"Grubach's behaviour indicated that the captain had said nothing he dared to add, ""Do you really think, then, that I'd want to make an enemy of you for the sake of a girl we hardly know?"" ""Yes, you're quite right, Mr. K.,"" said Mrs. Grubach, and then, to her misfortune, as soon as she felt just a little freer to speak, she added something rather inept. ""I kept asking myself why it was that Mr. K. took such an interest in Miss Brstner. Why does he quarrel with me over her when he knows that any cross word from him and I can't sleep that night? And I didn't say anything about Miss Brstner that I hadn't seen with my own eyes."" K. said nothing in reply, he should have chased her from the room as soon as she had opened her mouth, and he didn't want to do that. He contented himself with merely drinking his coffee and letting Mrs. Grubach feel that she was superfluous. Outside, the dragging steps of Miss Montag could still be heard as she went from one side of the hallway to the other. ""Do you hear that?"" asked K. pointing his hand at the door. ""Yes,"" said Mrs. Grubach with a sigh, ""I wanted to give her some help and I wanted the maid to help her too but she's stubborn, she wants to move everything in herself. I wonder at Miss Brstner. I often feel it's a burden for me to have Miss Montag as a tenant but Miss Brstner accepts her into her room with herself."" ""There's nothing there for you to worry about"" said K., crushing the remains of a sugar lump in his cup. ""Does she cause you any trouble?"" ""No,"" said Mrs. Grubach, ""in itself it's very good to have her there, it makes another room free for me and I can let my nephew, the captain, occupy it. I began to worry he might be disturbing you when I had to let him live in the living room next to you over the last few days. He's not very considerate."" ""What an idea!"" said K. standing up, ""there's no question of that. You seem to think that because I can't stand this to-ing and fro-ing of Miss Montag that I'm over-sensitive - and there she goes back again."" Mrs. Grubach appeared quite powerless. ""Should I tell her to leave moving the rest of her things over till later, then, Mr. K.? If that's what you want I'll do it immediately."" ""But she has to move in with Miss Brstner!"" said K. ""Yes,"" said Mrs. Grubach, without quite understanding what K. meant. ""So she has to take her things over there."" Mrs. Grubach just nodded. K. was irritated all the more by this dumb helplessness which, seen from the outside, could have seemed like a kind of defiance on her part. He began to walk up and down the room between the window and the door, thus depriving Mrs. Grubach of the chance to leave, which she otherwise probably would have done. Just as K. once more reached the door, someone knocked at it. It was the maid, to say that Miss Montag would like to have a few words with Mr. K., and therefore requested that he come to the dining room where she was waiting for him. K. heard the maid out thoughtfully, and then looked back at the shocked Mrs. Grubach in a way that was almost contemptuous. His look seemed to be saying that K. had been expecting this invitation for Miss Montag for a long time, and that it was confirmation of the suffering he had been made to endure that Sunday morning from Mrs. Grubach's tenants. He sent the maid back with the reply that he was on his way, then he went to the wardrobe to change his coat, and in answer to Mrs. Grubach's gentle whining about the nuisance Miss Montag was causing merely asked her to clear away the breakfast things. ""But you've hardly touched it,"" said Mrs. Grubach. ""Oh just take it away!"" shouted K. It seemed to him that Miss Montag was mixed up in everything and made it repulsive to him. As he went through the hallway he looked at the closed door of Miss Brstner's room. But it wasn't there that he was invited, but the dining room, to which he yanked the door open without knocking. The room was long but narrow with one window. There was only enough space available to put two cupboards at an angle in the corner by the door, and the rest of the room was entirely taken up with the long dining table which started by the door and reached all the way to the great window, which",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,36,"was thus made almost inaccessible. The table was already laid for a large number of people, as on Sundays almost all the tenants ate their dinner here at midday. When K. entered, Miss Montag came towards him from the window along one side of the table. They greeted each other in silence. Then Miss Montag, her head unusually erect as always, said, ""I'm not sure whether you know me."" K. looked at her with a frown. ""Of course I do,"" he said, ""you've been living here with Mrs. Grubach for quite some time now."" ""But I get the impression you don't pay much attention to what's going on in the lodging house,"" said Miss Montag. ""No,"" said K. ""Would you not like to sit down?"" said Miss Montag. In silence, the two of them drew chairs out from the farthest end of the table and sat down facing each other. But Miss Montag stood straight up again as she had left her handbag on the window sill and went to fetch it; she shuffled down the whole length of the room. When she came back, the handbag lightly swinging, she said, ""I'd like just to have a few words with you on behalf of my friend. She would have come herself, but she's feeling a little unwell today. Perhaps you'll be kind enough to forgive her and listen to me instead. There's anyway nothing that she could have said that I won't. On the contrary, in fact, I think I can say even more than her because I'm relatively impartial. Would you not agree?"" ""What is there to say, then?"" answered K., who was tired of Miss Montag continuously watching his lips. In that way she took control of what he wanted to say before he said it. ""Miss Brstner clearly refuses to grant me the personal meeting that I asked her for."" ""That's how it is,"" said Miss Montag, "" or rather, that's not at all how it is, the way you put it is remarkably severe. Generally speaking, meetings are neither granted nor the opposite. But it can be that meetings are considered unnecessary, and that's how it is here. Now, after your comment, I can speak openly. You asked my friend, verbally or in writing, for the chance to speak with her. Now my friend is aware of your reasons for asking for this meeting - or at least I suppose she is - and so, for reasons I know nothing about, she is quite sure that it would be of no benefit to anyone if this meeting actually took place. Moreover, it was only yesterday, and only very briefly, that she made it clear to me that such a meeting could be of no benefit for yourself either, she feels that it can only have been a matter of chance that such an idea came to you, and that even without any explanations from her, you will very soon come to realise yourself, if you have not done so already, the futility of your idea. My answer to that is that although it may be quite right, I consider it advantageous, if the matter is to be made perfectly clear, to give you an explicit answer. I offered my services in taking on the task, and after some hesitation my friend conceded. I hope, however, also to have acted in your interests, as even the slightest uncertainty in the least significant of matters will always remain a cause of suffering and if, as in this case, it can be removed without substantial effort, then it is better if that is done without delay."" ""I thank you,"" said K. as soon as Miss Montag had finished. He stood slowly up, looked at her, then across the table, then out the window - the house opposite stood there in the sun - and went to the door. Miss Montag followed him a few paces, as if she did not quite trust him. At the door, however, both of them had to step back as it opened and Captain Lanz entered. This was the first time that K. had seen him close up. He was a large man of about forty with a tanned, fleshy face. He bowed slightly, intending it also for K., and then went over to Miss Montag and deferentially kissed her hand. He was very elegant in the way he moved. The courtesy he showed towards Miss Montag made a striking contrast with the way she had been treated by K. Nonetheless, Miss Montag did not seem to be cross with K. as it even seemed to him that she wanted to introduce the captain. K. however, did not want to be introduced, he would not have been able to show any sort of friendliness",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,37,"either to Miss Montag or to the captain, the kiss on the hand had, for K., bound them into a group which would keep him at a distance from Miss Brstner whilst at the same time seeming to be totally harmless and unselfish. K. thought, however, that he saw more than that, he thought he also saw that Miss Montag had chosen a means of doing it that was good, but two-edged. She exaggerated the importance of the relationship between K. and Miss Brstner, and above all she exaggerated the importance of asking to speak with her and she tried at the same time to make out that K. was exaggerating everything. She would be disappointed, K. did not want to exaggerate anything, he was aware that Miss Brstner was a little typist who would not offer him much resistance for long. In doing so he deliberately took no account of what Mrs. Grubach had told him about Miss Brstner. All these things were going through his mind as he left the room with hardly a polite word. He wanted to go straight to his room, but a little laugh from Miss Montag that he heard from the dining room behind him brought him to the idea that he might prepare a surprise for the two of them, the captain and Miss Montag. He looked round and listened to find out if there might be any disturbance from any of the surrounding rooms, everywhere was quiet, the only thing to be heard was the conversation from the dining room and Mrs. Grubach's voice from the passage leading to the kitchen. This seemed an opportune time, K. went to Miss Brstner's room and knocked gently. There was no sound so he knocked again but there was still no answer in reply. Was she asleep? Or was she really unwell? Or was she just pretending as she realised it could only be K. knocking so gently? K. assumed she was pretending and knocked harder, eventually, when the knocking brought no result, he carefully opened the door with the sense of doing something that was not only improper but also pointless. In the room there was no-one. What's more, it looked hardly at all like the room K. had known before. Against the wall there were now two beds behind one another, there were clothes piled up on three chairs near the door, a wardrobe stood open. Miss Brstner must have gone out while Miss Montag was speaking to him in the dining room. K. was not greatly bothered by this, he had hardly expected to be able to find Miss Brstner so easily and had made this attempt for little more reason than to spite Miss Montag. But that made it all the more embarrassing for him when, as he was closing the door again, he saw Miss Montag and the captain talking in the open doorway of the dining room. They had probably been standing there ever since K. had opened the door, they avoided seeming to observe K. but chatted lightly and followed his movements with glances, the absent minded glances to the side such as you make during a conversation. But these glances were heavy for K., and he rushed alongside the wall back into his own room. Chapter Five The whip-man One evening, a few days later, K. was walking along one of the corridors that separated his office from the main stairway - he was nearly the last one to leave for home that evening, there remained only a couple of workers in the light of a single bulb in the dispatch department - when he heard a sigh from behind a door which he had himself never opened but which he had always thought just led into a junk room. He stood in amazement and listened again to establish whether he might not be mistaken. For a while there was silence, but then came some more sighs. His first thought was to fetch one of the servitors, it might well have been worth having a witness present, but then he was taken by an uncontrollable curiosity that make him simply yank the door open. It was, as he had thought, a junk room. Old, unusable forms, empty stone ink-bottles lay scattered behind the entrance. But in the cupboard-like room itself stood three men, crouching under the low ceiling. A candle fixed on a shelf gave them light. ""What are you doing here?"" asked K. quietly, but crossly and without thinking. One of the men was clearly in charge, and attracted attention by being dressed in a kind of dark leather costume which left his neck and chest and his arms exposed. He did not answer. But the other two called out, ""Mr. K.! We're to be",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,38,"beaten because you made a complaint about us to the examining judge."" And now, K. finally realised that it was actually the two policemen, Franz and Willem, and that the third man held a cane in his hand with which to beat them. ""Well,"" said K., staring at them, ""I didn't make any complaint, I only said what took place in my home. And your behaviour was not entirely unobjectionable, after all."" ""Mr. K.,"" said Willem, while Franz clearly tried to shelter behind him as protection from the third man, ""if you knew how badly we get paid you wouldn't think so badly of us. I've got a family to feed, and Franz here wanted to get married, you just have to get more money where you can, you can't do it just by working hard, not however hard you try. I was sorely tempted by your fine clothes, policemen aren't allowed to do that sort of thing, course they aren't, and it wasn't right of us, but it's tradition that the clothes go to the officers, that's how it's always been, believe me; and it's understandable too, isn't it, what can things like that mean for anyone unlucky enough to be arrested? But if he starts talking about it openly then the punishment has to follow."" ""I didn't know about any of this that you've been telling me, and I made no sort of request that you be punished, I was simply acting on principle."" ""Franz,"" said Willem, turning to the other policeman, ""didn't I tell you that the gentleman didn't say he wanted us to be punished? Now you can hear for yourself, he didn't even know we'd have to be punished."" ""Don't you let them persuade you, talking like that,"" said the third man to K., ""this punishment is both just and unavoidable."" ""Don't listen to him,"" said Willem, interrupting himself only to quickly bring his hand to his mouth when it had received a stroke of the cane, ""we're only being punished because you made a complaint against us. Nothing would have happened to us otherwise, not even if they'd found out what we'd done. Can you call that justice? Both of us, me especially, we'd proved our worth as good police officers over a long period - you've got to admit yourself that as far as official work was concerned we did the job well - things looked good for us, we had prospects, it's quite certain that we would've been made whip-men too, like this one, only he had the luck not to have anyone make a complaint about him, as you really don't get many complaints like that. Only that's all finished now, Mr. K., our careers are at an end, we're going to have to do work now that's far inferior to police work and besides all this we're going to get this terrible, painful beating."" ""Can the cane really cause so much pain, then?"" asked K., testing the cane that the whip-man swang in front of him. ""We're going to have to strip off totally naked,"" said Willem. ""Oh, I see,"" said K., looking straight at the whip-man, his skin was burned brown like a sailor's, and his face showed health and vigorous. ""Is there then no possibility of sparing these two their beating?"" he asked him. ""No,"" said the whip-man, shaking his head with a laugh. ""Get undressed!"" he ordered the policemen. And to K. he said, ""You shouldn't believe everything they tell you, it's the fear of being beaten, it's already made them a bit weak in the head. This one here, for instance,"" he pointed at Willem, ""all that he told you about his career prospects, it's just ridiculous. Look at him, look how fat he is - the first strokes of the cane will just get lost in all that fat. Do you know what it is that's made him so fat? He's in the habit of, everyone that gets arrested by him, he eats their breakfast. Didn't he eat up your breakfast? Yeah, I thought as much. But a man with a belly like that can't be made into a whip-man and never will be, that is quite out of the question."" ""There are whip-men like that,"" Willem insisted, who had just released the belt of this trousers. ""No,"" said the whip-man, striking him such a blow with the cane on his neck that it made him wince, ""you shouldn't be listening to this, just get undressed."" ""I would make it well worth your while if you would let them go,"" said K., and without looking at the whip-man again - as such matters are best carried on with both pairs of eyes turned down - he pulled out his wallet. ""And then you'd try and",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,39,"put in a complaint against me, too,"" said the whip-man, ""and get me flogged. No, no!"" ""Now, do be reasonable,"" said K., ""if I had wanted to get these two punished I would not now be trying to buy their freedom, would I. I could simply close the door here behind me, go home and see or hear nothing more of it. But that's not what I'm doing, it really is of much more importance to me to let them go free; if I had realised they would be punished, or even that they might be punished, I would never have named them in the first place as they are not the ones I hold responsible. It's the organisation that's to blame, the high officials are the ones to blame."" ""That's how it is!"" shouted the policemen, who then immediately received another blow on their backs, which were by now exposed. ""If you had a senior judge here beneath your stick,"" said K., pressing down the cane as he spoke to stop it being raised once more, ""I really would do nothing to stop you, on the contrary, I would even pay you money to give you all the more strength."" ""Yeah, that's all very plausible, what you're saying there,"" said the whip-man , ""only I'm not the sort of person you can bribe. It's my job to flog people, so I flog them."" Franz, the policeman, had been fairly quiet so far, probably in expectation of a good result from K.'s intervention, but now he stepped forward to the door wearing just his trousers, kneeled down hanging on to K.'s arm and whispered, ""Even if you can't get mercy shown for both of us, at least try and get me set free. Willem is older than me, he's less sensitive than me in every way, he even got a light beating a couple of years ago, but my record's still clean, I only did things the way I did because Willem led me on to it, he's been my teacher both for good and bad. Down in front of the bank my poor bride is waiting for me at the entrance, I'm so ashamed of myself, it's pitiful."" His face was flowing over with tears, and he wiped it dry on K.'s coat. ""I'm not going to wait any longer,"" said the whip-man, taking hold of the cane in both hands and laying in to Franz while Willem cowered back in a corner and looked on secretly, not even daring to turn his head. Then, the sudden scream that shot out from Franz was long and irrevocable, it seemed to come not from a human being but from an instrument that was being tortured, the whole corridor rang with it, it must have been heard by everyone in the building. ""Don't shout like that!"", called out K., unable to prevent himself, and, as he looked anxiously in the direction from which the servitor would come, he gave Franz a shove, not hard, but hard enough for him to fall down unconscious, clawing at the ground with his hands by reflex; he still did not avoid being hit; the rod still found him on the floor; the tip of the rod swang regularly up and down while he rolled to and fro under its blows. And now one of the servitors appeared in the distance, with another a few steps behind him. K. had quickly thrown the door shut, gone over to one of the windows overlooking the yard and opened it. The screams had completely stopped. So that the servitor wouldn't come in, he called out, ""It's only me!"" ""Good evening, chief clerk,"" somebody called back. ""Is there anything wrong?"" ""No, no,"" answered K., ""it's only a dog yelping in the yard."" There was no sound from the servitors so he added, ""You can go back to what you were doing."" He did not want to become involved with a conversation with them, and so he leant out of the window. A little while later, when he looked out in the corridor, they had already gone. Now, K. remained at the window, he did not dare go back into the junk room, and he did not want to go home either. The yard he looked down into was small and rectangular, all around it were offices, all the windows were now dark and only those at the very top caught a reflection of the moon. K tried hard to see into the darkness of one corner of the yard, where a few handcarts had been left behind one another. He felt anguish at not having been able to prevent the flogging, but that was not his fault, if Franz had not screamed like that - clearly it must have",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,40,"caused a great deal of pain but it's important to maintain control of oneself at important moments - if Franz had not screamed then it was at least highly probable that K. would have been able to dissuade the whip-man. If all the junior officers were contemptible why would the whip-man, whose position was the most inhumane of all, be any exception, and K. had noticed very clearly how his eyes had lit up when he saw the banknotes, he had obviously only seemed serious about the flogging to raise the level of the bribe a little. And K. had not been ungenerous, he really had wanted to get the policemen freed; if he really had now begun to do something against the degeneracy of the court then it was a matter of course that he would have to do something here as well. But of course, it became impossible for him to do anything as soon as Franz started screaming. K. could not possibly have let the junior bank staff, and perhaps even all sorts of other people, come along and catch him by surprise as he haggled with those people in the junk room. Nobody could really expect that sort of sacrifice of him. If that had been his intention then it would almost have been easier, K. would have taken his own clothes off and offered himself to the whip-man in the policemen's place. The whip-man would certainly not have accepted this substitution anyway, as in that way he would have seriously violated his duty without gaining any benefit. He would most likely have violated his duty twice over, as court employees were probably under orders not to cause any harm to K. while he was facing charges, although there may have been special conditions in force here. However things stood, K. was able to do no more than throw the door shut, even though that would still do nothing to remove all the dangers he faced. It was regrettable that he had given Franz a shove, and it could only be excused by the heat of the moment. In the distance, he heard the steps of the servitors; he did not want them to be too aware of his presence, so he closed the window and walked towards the main staircase. At the door of the junk room he stopped and listened for a little while. All was silent. The two policemen were entirely at the whip-man's mercy; he could have beaten them to death. K. reached his hand out for the door handle but drew it suddenly back. He was no longer in any position to help anyone, and the servitors would soon be back; he did, though, promise himself that he would raise the matter again with somebody and see that, as far as it was in his power, those who really were guilty, the high officials whom nobody had so far dared point out to him, received their due punishment. As he went down the main stairway at the front of the bank, he looked carefully round at everyone who was passing, but there was no girl to be seen who might have been waiting for somebody, not even within some distance from the bank. Franz's claim that his bride was waiting for him was thus shown to be a lie, albeit one that was forgivable and intended only to elicit more sympathy. The policemen were still on K.'s mind all through the following day; he was unable to concentrate on his work and had to stay in his office a little longer than the previous day so that he could finish it. On the way home, as he passed by the junk room again, he opened its door as if that had been his habit. Instead of the darkness he expected, he saw everything unchanged from the previous evening, and did not know how he should respond. Everything was exactly the same as he had seen it when he had opened the door the previous evening. The forms and bottles of ink just inside the doorway, the whip-man with his cane, the two policemen, still undressed, the candle on the shelf, and the two policemen began to wail and call out ""Mr. K.!"" K. slammed the door immediately shut, and even thumped on it with his fists as if that would shut it all the firmer. Almost in tears, he ran to the servitors working quietly at the copying machine. ""Go and get that junk room cleared out!"" he shouted, and, in amazement, they stopped what they were doing. ""It should have been done long ago, we're sinking in dirt!"" They would be able to do the job the next day, K. nodded, it was too late in the evening to make",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,41,"them do it there and then as he had originally intended. He sat down briefly in order to keep them near him for a little longer, looked through a few of the copies to give the impression that he was checking them and then, as he saw that they would not dare to leave at the same time as himself, went home tired and with his mind numb. Chapter Six K.'s uncle - Leni One afternoon - K. was very busy at the time, getting the post ready - K.'s Uncle Karl, a small country land owner, came into the room, pushing his way between two of the staff who were bringing in some papers. K. had long expected his uncle to appear, but the sight of him now shocked K. far less than the prospect of it had done a long time before. His uncle was bound to come, K. had been sure of that for about a month. He already thought at the time he could see how his uncle would arrive, slightly bowed, his battered panama hat in his left hand, his right hand already stretched out over the desk long before he was close enough as he rushed carelessly towards K. knocking over everything that was in his way. K.'s uncle was always in a hurry, as he suffered from the unfortunate belief that he had a number things to do while he was in the big city and had to settle all of them in one day - his visits were only ever for one day - and at the same time thought he could not forgo any conversation or piece of business or pleasure that might arise by chance. Uncle Karl was K.'s former guardian, and so K. was duty-bound to help him in all of this as well as to offer him a bed for the night. 'I'm haunted by a ghost from the country', he would say. As soon as they had greeted each other - K. had invited him to sit in the armchair but Uncle Karl had no time for that - he said he wanted to speak briefly with K. in private. ""It is necessary,"" he said with a tired gulp, ""it is necessary for my peace of mind."" K. immediately sent the junior staff from the room and told them to let no-one in. ""What's this that I've been hearing, Josef?"" cried K.'s uncle when they were alone, as he sat on the table shoving various papers under himself without looking at them to make himself more comfortable. K. said nothing, he knew what was coming, but, suddenly relieved from the effort of the work he had been doing, he gave way to a pleasant lassitude and looked out the window at the other side of the street. From where he sat, he could see just a small, triangular section of it, part of the empty walls of houses between two shop windows. ""You're staring out the window!"" called out his uncle, raising his arms, ""For God's sake, Josef, give me an answer! Is it true, can it really be true?"" ""Uncle Karl,"" said K., wrenching himself back from his daydreaming, ""I really don't know what it is you want of me."" ""Josef,"" said his uncle in a warning tone, ""as far as I know, you've always told the truth. Am I to take what you've just said as a bad sign?"" ""I think I know what it is you want,"" said K. obediently, ""I expect you've heard about my trial."" ""That's right,"" answered his uncle with a slow nod, ""I've heard about your trial."" ""Who did you hear it from, then?"" asked K. ""Erna wrote to me,"" said his uncle, ""she doesn't have much contact with you, it's true, you don't pay very much attention to her, I'm afraid to say, but she learned about it nonetheless. I got her letter today and, of course, I came straight here. And for no other reason, but it seems to me that this is reason enough. I can read you out the part of the letter that concerns you."" He drew the letter out from his wallet. ""Here it is. She writes; 'I have not seen Josef for a long time, I was in the bank last week but Josef was so busy that they would not let me through; I waited there for nearly an hour but then I had to go home as I had my piano lesson. I would have liked to have spoken to him, maybe there will be a chance another time. He sent me a big box of chocolates for my name-day, that was very nice and attentive of him. I forgot to tell you about it when I wrote, and I only",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,42,"remember now that you ask me about it. Chocolate, as I am sure you are aware, disappears straight away in this lodging house, almost as soon as you know somebody has given you chocolate it is gone. But there is something else I wanted to tell you about Josef. Like I said, they would not let me through to see him at the bank because he was negotiating with some gentleman just then. After I had been waiting quietly for quite a long time I asked one of the staff whether his meeting would last much longer. He said it might well do, as it was probably about the legal proceedings, he said, that were being conducted against him. I asked what sort of legal proceedings it was that were being conducted against the chief clerk, and whether he was not making some mistake, but he said he was not making any mistake, there were legal proceedings underway and even that they were about something quite serious, but he did not know any more about it. He would have liked to have been of some help to the chief clerk himself, as the chief clerk was a gentleman, good and honest, but he did not know what it was he could do and merely hoped there would be some influential gentlemen who would take his side. I'm sure that is what will happen and that everything will turn out for the best in the end, but in the mean time things do not look at all good, and you can see that from the mood of the chief clerk himself. Of course, I did not place too much importance on this conversation, and even did my best to put the bank clerk's mind at rest, he was quite a simple man. I told him he was not to speak to anyone else about this, and I think it is all just a rumour, but I still think it might be good if you, Dear Father, if you looked into the matter the next time you visit. It will be easy for you to find out more detail and, if it is really necessary, to do something about it through the great and influential people you know. But if it is not necessary, and that is what seems most likely, then at least your daughter will soon have the chance to embrace you and I look forward to it.' - She's a good child,"" said K.'s uncle when he had finished reading, and wiped a few tears from his eyes. K. nodded. With all the different disruptions he had had recently he had completely forgotten about Erna, even her birthday, and the story of the chocolates had clearly just been invented so that he wouldn't get in trouble with his aunt and uncle. It was very touching, and even the theatre tickets, which he would regularly send her from then on, would not be enough to repay her, but he really did not feel, now, that it was right for him to visit her in her lodgings and hold conversations with a little, eighteen year old schoolgirl. ""And what do you have to say about that?"" asked his uncle,who had forgotten all his rush and excitement as he read the letter, and seemed to be about to read it again. ""Yes, Uncle,"" said K., ""it is true."" ""True!"" called out his uncle. ""What is true? How can this be true? What sort of trial is it? Not a criminal trial, I hope?"" ""It's a criminal trial,"" answered K. ""And you sit quietly here while you've got a criminal trial round your neck?"" shouted his uncle, getting ever louder. ""The more calm I am, the better it will be for the outcome,"" said K. in a tired voice, ""don't worry."" ""How can I help worrying?!"" shouted his uncle, ""Josef, my Dear Josef, think about yourself, about your family, think about our good name! Up till now, you've always been our pride, don't now become our disgrace. I don't like the way you're behaving,"" he said, looking at K. with his head at an angle, ""that's not how an innocent man behaves when he's accused of something, not if he's still got any strength in him. Just tell me what it's all about so that I can help you. It's something to do with the bank, I take it?"" ""No,"" said K. as he stood up, ""and you're speaking too loud, Uncle, I expect one of the staff is listening at the door and I find that rather unpleasant. It's best if we go somewhere else, then I can answer all your questions, as far as I can. And I know very well that I have to account to the family for what",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,43,"I do."" ""You certainly do!"" his uncle shouted, ""Quite right, you do. Now just get a move on, Josef, hurry up now!"" ""I still have a few documents I need to prepare,"" said K., and, using the intercom, he summoned his deputy who entered a few moments later. K.'s uncle, still angry and excited, gestured with his hand to show that K. had summoned him, even though there was no need whatever to do so. K. stood in front of the desk and explained to the young man, who listened calm and attentive, what would need to be done that day in his absence, speaking in a calm voice and making use of various documents. The presence of K.'s uncle while this was going on was quite disturbing; he did not listen to what was being said, but at first he stood there with eyes wide open and nervously biting his lips. Then he began to walk up and down the room, stopped now and then at the window, or stood in front of a picture always making various exclamations such as, ""That is totally incomprehensible to me!"" or ""Now just tell me, what are you supposed to make of that?!"" The young man pretended to notice nothing of this and listened to K.'s instructions through to the end, he made a few notes, bowed to both K. and his uncle and then left the room. K.'s uncle had turned his back to him and was looking out the window, bunching up the curtains with his outstretched hands. The door had hardly closed when he called out, ""At last! Now that he's stopped jumping about we can go too!"" Once they were in the front hall of the bank, where several members of staff were standing about and where, just then, the deputy director was walking across, there was unfortunately no way of stopping K.'s uncle from continually asking questions about the trial. ""Now then, Josef,"" he began, lightly acknowledging the bows from those around them as they passed, ""tell me everything about this trial; what sort of trial is it?"" K. made a few comments which conveyed little information, even laughed a little, and it was only when they reached the front steps that he explained to his uncle that he had not wanted to talk openly in front of those people. ""Quite right,"" said his uncle, ""but now start talking."" With his head to one side, and smoking his cigar in short, impatient draughts, he listened. ""First of all, Uncle,"" said K., ""it's not a trial like you'd have in a normal courtroom."" ""So much the worse,"" said his uncle. ""How's that?"" asked K., looking at him. ""What I mean is, that's for the worse,"" he repeated. They were standing on the front steps of the bank; as the doorkeeper seemed to be listening to what they were saying K. drew his uncle down further, where they were absorbed into the bustle of the street. His uncle took K.'s arm and stopped asking questions with such urgency about the trial, they walked on for a while in silence. ""But how did all this come about?"" he eventually asked, stopping abruptly enough to startle the people walking behind, who had to avoid walking into him. ""Things like this don't come all of a sudden, they start developing a long time beforehand, there must have been warning signs of it, why didn't you write to me? You know I'd do anything for you, to some extent I am still your guardian, and until today that's something I was proud of. I'll still help you, of course I will, only now, now that the trial is already underway, it makes it very difficult. But whatever; the best thing now is for you to take a short holiday staying with us in the country. You've lost weight, I can see that now. The country life will give you strength, that will be good, there's bound to be a lot of hard work ahead of you. But besides that it'll be a way of getting you away from the court, to some extent. Here they've got every means of showing the powers at their disposal and they're automatically bound to use them against you; in the country they'll either have to delegate authority to different bodies or just have to try and bother you by letter, telegram or telephone. And that's bound to weaken the effect, it won't release you from them but it'll give you room to breathe."" ""You could forbid me to leave,"" said K., who had been drawn slightly into his uncle's way of thinking by what he had been saying. ""I didn't think you would do it,"" said his uncle thoughtfully, ""you won't suffer too much loss of power",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,44,"by moving away."" K. grasped his uncle under the arm to prevent him stopping still and said, ""I thought you'd think all this is less important than I do, and now you're taking it so hard."" ""Josef,"" called his uncle trying to disentangle himself from him so that he could stop walking, but K. did not let go, ""you've completely changed, you used to be so astute, are you losing it now? Do you want to lose the trial? Do you realise what that would mean? That would mean you would be simply destroyed. And that everyone you know would be pulled down with you or at the very least humiliated, disgraced right down to the ground. Josef, pull yourself together. The way you're so indifferent about it, it's driving me mad. Looking at you I can almost believe that old saying: 'Having a trial like that means losing a trial like that'."" ""My dear Uncle,"" said K., ""it won't do any good to get excited, it's no good for you to do it and it'd be no good for me to do it. The case won't be won by getting excited, and please admit that my practical experience counts for something, just as I have always and still do respect your experience, even when it surprises me. You say that the family will also be affected by this trial; I really can't see how, but that's beside the point and I'm quite willing to follow your instructions in all of this. Only, I don't see any advantage in staying in the country, not even for you, as that would indicate flight and a sense of guilt. And besides, although I am more subject to persecution if I stay in the city I can also press the matter forward better here."" ""You're right,"" said his uncle in a tone that seemed to indicate they were finally coming closer to each other, ""I just made the suggestion because, as I saw it, if you stay in the city the case will be put in danger by your indifference to it, and I thought it was better if I did the work for you. But will you push things forward yourself with all your strength, if so, that will naturally be far better."" ""We're agreed then,"" said K. ""And do you have any suggestions for what I should do next?"" ""Well, naturally I'll have to think about it,"" said his uncle, ""you must bear in mind that I've been living in the country for twenty years now, almost without a break, you lose your ability to deal with matters like this. But I do have some important connections with several people who, I expect, know their way around these things better than I do, and to contact them is a matter of course. Out there in the country I've been getting out of condition, I'm sure you're already aware of that. It's only at times like this that you notice it yourself. And this affair of yours came largely unexpected, although, oddly enough, I had expected something of the sort after I'd read Erna's letter, and today when I saw your face I knew it with almost total certainty. But all that is by the by, the important thing now is, we have no time to lose."" Even while he was still speaking, K.'s uncle had stood on tiptoe to summon a taxi and now he pulled K. into the car behind himself as he called out an address to the driver. ""We're going now to see Dr. Huld, the lawyer,"" he said, ""we were at school together. I'm sure you know the name, don't you? No? Well that is odd. He's got a very good reputation as a defence barrister and for working with the poor. But I esteem him especially as someone you can trust."" ""It's alright with me, whatever you do,"" said K., although he was made uneasy by the rushed and urgent way his uncle was dealing with the matter. It was not very encouraging, as the accused, be to taken to a lawyer for poor people. ""I didn't know,"" he said, ""that you could take on a lawyer in matters like this."" ""Well of course you can,"" said his uncle, ""that goes without saying. Why wouldn't you take on a lawyer? And now, so that I'm properly instructed in this matter, tell me what's been happening so far."" K. instantly began telling his uncle about what had been happening, holding nothing back - being completely open with him was the only way that K. could protest at his uncle's belief that the trial was a great disgrace. He mentioned Miss Brstner's name just once and in passing, but that did nothing to diminish his openness about the",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,45,"trial as Miss Brstner had no connection with it. As he spoke, he looked out the window and saw how, just then, they were getting closer to the suburb where the court offices were. He drew this to his uncle's attention, but he did not find the coincidence especially remarkable. The taxi stopped in front of a dark building. K.'s uncle knocked at the very first door at ground level; while they waited he smiled, showing his big teeth, and whispered, ""Eight o'clock; not the usual sort of time to be visiting a lawyer, but Huld won't mind it from me."" Two large, black eyes appeared in the spy-hatch in the door, they stared at the two visitors for a while and then disappeared; the door, however, did not open. K. and his uncle confirmed to each other the fact that they had seen the two eyes. ""A new maid, afraid of strangers,"" said K.'s uncle, and knocked again. The eyes appeared once more. This time they seemed almost sad, but the open gas flame that burned with a hiss close above their heads gave off little light and that may have merely created an illusion. ""Open the door,"" called K.'s uncle, raising his fist against it, ""we are friends of Dr. Huld, the lawyer!"" ""Dr. Huld is ill,"" whispered someone behind them. In a doorway at the far end of a narrow passage stood a man in his dressing gown, giving them this information in an extremely quiet voice. K.'s uncle, who had already been made very angry by the long wait, turned abruptly round and retorted, ""Ill? You say he's ill?"" and strode towards the gentleman in a way that seemed almost threatening, as if he were the illness himself. ""They've opened the door for you, now,"" said the gentleman, pointing at the door of the lawyer. He pulled his dressing gown together and disappeared. The door had indeed been opened, a young girl - K. recognised the dark, slightly bulging eyes - stood in the hallway in a long white apron, holding a candle in her hand. ""Next time, open up sooner!"" said K.'s uncle instead of a greeting, while the girl made a slight curtsey. ""Come along, Josef,"" he then said to K. who was slowly moving over towards the girl. ""Dr. Huld is unwell,"" said the girl as K.'s uncle, without stopping, rushed towards one of the doors. K. continued to look at the girl in amazement as she turned round to block the way into the living room, she had a round face like a puppy's, not only the pale cheeks and the chin were round but the temples and the hairline were too. ""Josef!"" called his uncle once more, and he asked the girl, ""It's trouble with his heart, is it?"" ""I think it is, sir,"" said the girl, who by now had found time to go ahead with the candle and open the door into the room. In one corner of the room, where the light of the candle did not reach, a face with a long beard looked up from the bed. ""Leni, who's this coming in?"" asked the lawyer, unable to recognise his guests because he was dazzled by the candle. ""It's your old friend, Albert,"" said K.'s uncle. ""Oh, Albert,"" said the lawyer, falling back onto his pillow as if this visit meant he would not need to keep up appearances. ""Is it really as bad as that?"" asked K.'s uncle, sitting on the edge of the bed. ""I don't believe it is. It's a recurrence of your heart trouble and it'll pass over like the other times."" ""Maybe,"" said the lawyer quietly, ""but it's just as much trouble as it's ever been. I can hardly breathe, I can't sleep at all and I'm getting weaker by the day."" ""I see,"" said K.'s uncle, pressing his panama hat firmly against his knee with his big hand. ""That is bad news. But are you getting the right sort of care? And it's so depressing in here, it's so dark. It's a long time since I was last here, but it seemed to me friendlier then. Even your young lady here doesn't seem to have much life in her, unless she's just pretending."" The maid was still standing by the door with the candle; as far as could be made out, she was watching K. more than she was watching his uncle even while the latter was still speaking about her. K. leant against a chair that he had pushed near to the girl. ""When you're as ill as I am,"" said the lawyer, ""you need to have peace. I don't find it depressing."" After a short pause he added, ""and Leni looks after me well, she's a good girl."" But",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,46,"that was not enough to persuade K.'s uncle, he had visibly taken against his friend's carer and, even though he did not contradict the invalid, he persecuted her with his scowl as she went over to the bed, put the candle on the bedside table and, leaning over the bed, made a fuss of him by tidying the pillows. K.'s uncle nearly forgot the need to show any consideration for the man who lay ill in bed, he stood up, walked up and down behind the carer, and K. would not have been surprised if he had grabbed hold of her skirts behind her and dragged her away from the bed. K. himself looked on calmly, he was not even disappointed at finding the lawyer unwell, he had been able to do nothing to oppose the enthusiasm his uncle had developed for the matter, he was glad that this enthusiasm had now been distracted without his having to do anything about it. His uncle, probably simply wishing to be offensive to the lawyer's attendant, then said, ""Young lady, now please leave us alone for a while, I have some personal matters to discuss with my friend."" Dr. Huld's carer was still leant far over the invalid's bed and smoothing out the cloth covering the wall next to it, she merely turned her head and then, in striking contrast with the anger that first stopped K.'s uncle from speaking and then let the words out in a gush, she said very quietly, ""You can see that Dr. Huld is so ill that he can't discuss any matters at all."" It was probably just for the sake of convenience that she had repeated the words spoken by K.'s uncle, but an onlooker might even have perceived it as mocking him and he, of course, jumped up as if he had just been stabbed. ""You damned ... ,"" in the first gurglings of his excitement his words could hardly be understood, K. was startled even though he had been expecting something of the sort and ran to his uncle with the intention, no doubt, of closing his mouth with both his hands. Fortunately, though, behind the girl, the invalid raised himself up, K.'s uncle made an ugly face as if swallowing something disgusting and then, somewhat calmer, said, ""We have naturally not lost our senses, not yet; if what I am asking for were not possible I would not be asking for it. Now please, go!"" The carer stood up straight by the bed directly facing K.'s uncle, K. thought he noticed that with one hand she was stroking the lawyer's hand. ""You can say anything in front of Leni,"" said the invalid, in a tone that was unmistakably imploring. ""It's not my business,"" said K.'s uncle, ""and it's not my secrets."" And he twisted himself round as if wanting to go into no more negotiations but giving himself a little more time to think. ""Whose business is it then?"" asked the lawyer in an exhausted voice as he leant back again. ""My nephew's,"" said K.'s uncle, ""and I've brought him along with me."" And he introduced him, ""Chief Clerk Josef K."" ""Oh!"" said the invalid, now with much more life in him, and reached out his hand towards K. ""Do forgive me, I didn't notice you there at all."" Then he then said to his carer, ""Leni, go,"" stretching his hand out to her as if this were a farewell that would have to last for a long time. This time the girl offered no resistance. ""So you,"" he finally said to K.'s uncle, who had also calmed down and stepped closer, ""you haven't come to visit me because I'm ill but you've come on business."" The lawyer now looked so much stronger that it seemed the idea of being visited because he was ill had somehow made him weak, he remained supporting himself of one elbow, which must have been rather tiring, and continually pulled at a lock of hair in the middle of his beard. ""You already look much better,"" said K.'s uncle, ""now that that witch has gone outside."" He interrupted himself, whispered, ""I bet you she's listening!"" and sprang over to the door. But behind the door there was no-one, K.'s uncle came back not disappointed, as her not listening seemed to him worse than if she had been, but probably somewhat embittered. ""You're mistaken about her,"" said the lawyer, but did nothing more to defend her; perhaps that was his way of indicating that she did not need defending. But in a tone that was much more committed he went on, ""As far as your nephew's affairs are concerned, this will be an extremely difficult undertaking and I'd count myself lucky if my strength lasted out long",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,47,"enough for it; I'm greatly afraid it won't do, but anyway I don't want to leave anything untried; if I don't last out you can always get somebody else. To be honest, this matters interests me too much, and I can't bring myself to give up the chance of taking some part in it. If my heart does totally give out then at least it will have found a worthy affair to fail in."" K. believed he understood not a word of this entire speech, he looked at his uncle for an explanation but his uncle sat on the bedside table with the candle in his hand, a medicine bottle had rolled off the table onto the floor, he nodded to everything the lawyer said, agreed to everything, and now and then looked at K. urging him to show the same compliance. Maybe K.'s uncle had already told the lawyer about the trial. But that was impossible, everything that had happened so far spoke against it. So he said, ""I don't understand ... "" ""Well, maybe I've misunderstood what you've been saying,"" said the lawyer, just as astonished and embarrassed as K. ""Perhaps I've been going too fast. What was it you wanted to speak to me about? I thought it was to do with your trial."" ""Of course it is,"" said K.'s uncle, who then asked K., ""So what is it you want?"" ""Yes, but how is it that you know anything about me and my case?"" asked K. ""Oh, I see,"" said the lawyer with a smile. ""I am a lawyer, I move in court circles, people talk about various different cases and the more interesting ones stay in your mind, especially when they concern the nephew of a friend. There's nothing very remarkable about that."" ""What is it you want, then?"" asked K.'s uncle once more, ""You seem so uneasy about it"" ""You move in this court's circles?"" asked K. ""Yes,"" said the lawyer. ""You're asking questions like a child,"" said K.'s uncle. ""What circles should I move in, then, if not with members of my own discipline?"" the lawyer added. It sounded so indisputable that K. gave no answer at all. ""But you work in the High Court, not that court in the attic,"" he had wanted to say but could not bring himself to actually utter it. ""You have to realise,"" the lawyer continued, in a tone as if he were explaining something obvious, unnecessary and incidental, ""you have to realise that I also derive great advantage for my clients from mixing with those people, and do so in many different ways, it's not something you can keep talking about all the time. I'm at a bit of a disadvantage now, of course, because of my illness, but I still get visits from some good friends of mine at the court and I learn one or two things. It might even be that I learn more than many of those who are in the best of health and spend all day in court. And I'm receiving a very welcome visit right now, for instance."" And he pointed into a dark corner of the room. ""Where?"" asked K., almost uncouth in his surprise. He looked round uneasily; the little candle gave off far too little light to reach as far as the wall opposite. And then, something did indeed begin to move there in the corner. In the light of the candle held up by K.'s uncle an elderly gentleman could be seen sitting beside a small table. He had been sitting there for so long without being noticed that he could hardly have been breathing. Now he stood up with a great deal of fuss, clearly unhappy that attention had been drawn to him. It was as if, by flapping his hands about like short wings, he hoped to deflect any introductions and greetings, as if he wanted on no account to disturb the others by his presence and seemed to be exhorting them to leave him back in the dark and forget about his being there. That, however, was something that could no longer be granted him. ""You took us by surprise, you see,"" said the lawyer in explanation, cheerfully indicating to the gentleman that he should come closer, which, slowly, hesitatingly, looking all around him, but with a certain dignity, he did. ""The office director - oh, yes, forgive me, I haven't introduced you - this is my friend Albert K., this is his nephew, the chief clerk Josef K., and this is the office director - so, the office director was kind enough to pay me a visit. It's only possible to appreciate just how valuable a visit like this is if you've been let into the secret of what a pile",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,48,"of work the office director has heaped over him. Well, he came anyway, we were having a peaceful chat, as far as I was able when I'm so weak, and although we hadn't told Leni she mustn't let anyone in as we weren't expecting anyone, we still would rather have remained alone, but then along came you, Albert, thumping your fists on the door, the office director moved over into the corner pulling his table and chair with him, but now it turns out we might have, that is, if that's what you wish, we might have something to discuss with each other and it would be good if we can all come back together again. - Office director ... , "" he said with his head on one side, pointing with a humble smile to an armchair near the bed. ""I'm afraid I'll only be able to stay a few minutes more,"" smiled the office director as he spread himself out in the armchair and looked at the clock. ""Business calls. But I wouldn't want to miss the chance of meeting a friend of my friend."" He inclined his head slightly toward K.'s uncle, who seemed very happy with his new acquaintance, but he was not the sort of person to express his feelings of deference and responded to the office director's words with embarrassed, but loud, laughter. A horrible sight! K. was able to quietly watch everything as nobody paid any attention to him, the office director took over as leader of the conversation as seemed to be his habit once he had been called forward, the lawyer listened attentively with his hand to his ear, his initial weakness having perhaps only had the function of driving away his new visitors, K.'s uncle served as candle-bearer - balancing the candle on his thigh while the office director frequently glanced nervously at it - and was soon free of his embarrassment and was quickly enchanted not only by the office director's speaking manner but also by the gentle, waving hand-movements with which he accompanied it. K., leaning against the bedpost, was totally ignored by the office director, perhaps deliberately, and served the old man only as audience. And besides, he had hardly any idea what the conversation was about and his thoughts soon turned to the care assistant and the ill treatment she had suffered from his uncle. Soon after, he began to wonder whether he had not seen the office director somewhere before, perhaps among the people who were at his first hearing. He may have been mistaken, but thought the office director might well have been among the old gentlemen with the thin beards in the first row. There was then a noise that everyone heard from the hallway as if something of porcelain were being broken. ""I'll go and see what's happened,"" said K., who slowly left the room as if giving the others the chance to stop him. He had hardly stepped into the hallway, finding his bearings in the darkness with his hand still firmly holding the door, when another small hand, much smaller than K.'s own, placed itself on his and gently shut the door. It was the carer who had been waiting there. ""Nothing has happened,"" she whispered to him, ""I just threw a plate against the wall to get you out of there."" ""I was thinking about you, as well,"" replied K. uneasily. ""So much the better,"" said the carer. ""Come with me"". A few steps along, they came to a frosted glass door which the carer opened for him. ""Come in here,"" she said. It was clearly the lawyer's office, fitted out with old, heavy furniture, as far as could be seen in the moonlight which now illuminated just a small, rectangular section of the floor by each of the three big windows. ""This way,"" said the carer, pointing to a dark trunk with a carved, wooden backrest. When he had sat down, K. continued to look round the room, it was a large room with a high ceiling, the clients of this lawyer for the poor must have felt quite lost in it. K. thought he could see the little steps with which visitors would approach the massive desk. But then he forgot about all of this and had eyes only for the carer who sat very close beside him, almost pressing him against the armrest. ""I did think,"" she said ""you would come out here to me by yourself with me having to call you first. It was odd. First you stare at me as soon as you come in, and then you keep me waiting. And you ought to call me Leni, too,"" she added quickly and suddenly, as if no moment of this conversation should be",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,49,"lost. ""Gladly,"" said K. ""But as for its being odd, Leni, that's easy to explain. Firstly, I had to listen to what the old men were saying and couldn't leave without a good reason, but secondly I'm not a bold person, if anything I'm quite shy, and you, Leni, you didn't really look like you could be won over in one stroke, either."" ""That's not it,"" said Leni, laying one arm on the armrest and looking at K., ""you didn't like me, and I don't suppose you like me now, either."" ""Liking wouldn't be very much,"" said K., evasively. ""Oh!"" she exclaimed with a smile, thus making use of K.'s comment to gain an advantage over him. So K. remained silent for a while. By now, he had become used to the darkness in the room and was able to make out various fixtures and fittings. He was especially impressed by a large picture hanging to the right of the door, he leant forward in order to see it better. It depicted a man wearing a judge's robes; he was sitting on a lofty throne gilded in a way that shone forth from the picture. The odd thing about the picture was that this judge was not sitting there in dignified calm but had his left arm pressed against the back and armrest, his right arm, however, was completely free and only grasped the armrest with his hand, as if about to jump up any moment in vigorous outrage and make some decisive comment or even to pass sentence. The accused was probably meant to be imagined at the foot of the steps, the top one of which could be seen in the picture, covered with a yellow carpet. ""That might be my judge,"" said K., pointing to the picture with one finger. ""I know him,"" said Leni looking up at the picture, ""he comes here quite often. That picture is from when he was young, but he can never have looked anything like it, as he's tiny, minute almost. But despite that, he had himself made to look bigger in the picture as he's madly vain, just like everyone round here. But even I'm vain and that makes me very unhappy that you don't like me."" K. replied to that last comment merely by embracing Leni and drawing her towards him, she lay her head quietly on his shoulder. To the rest of it, though, he said, ""What rank is he?"" ""He's an examining judge,"" she said, taking hold of the hand with which K. held her and playing with his fingers. ""Just an examining judge once again,"" said K. in disappointment, ""the senior officials keep themselves hidden. But here he is sitting on a throne."" ""That's all just made up,"" said Leni with her face bent over K.'s hand, ""really he's sitting on a kitchen chair with an old horse blanket folded over it. But do you have to be always thinking about your trial?"" she added slowly. ""No, not at all,"" said K., ""I probably even think too little about it."" ""That's not the mistake you're making,"" said Leni, ""you're too unyielding, that's what I've heard."" ""Who said that?"" asked K., he felt her body against his chest and looked down on her rich, dark, tightly-bound hair. ""I'd be saying too much if I told you that,"" answered Leni. ""Please don't ask for names, but do stop making these mistakes of yours, stop being so unyielding, there's nothing you can do to defend yourself from this court, you have to confess. So confess to them as soon as you get the chance. It's only then that they give you the chance to get away, not till then. Only, without help from outside even that's impossible, but you needn't worry about getting this help as I want to help you myself."" ""You understand a lot about this court and what sort of tricks are needed,"" said K. as he lifted her, since she was pressing in much too close to him, onto his lap. ""That's alright, then,"" she said, and made herself comfortable on his lap by smoothing out her skirt and adjusting her blouse. Then she hung both her arms around his neck, leant back and took a long look at him. ""And what if I don't confess, could you not help me then?"" asked K. to test her out. I'm accumulating women to help me, he thought to himself almost in amazement, first Miss Brstner, then the court usher's wife, and now this little care assistant who seems to have some incomprehensible need for me. The way she sits on my lap as if it were her proper place! ""No,"" answered Leni, slowly shaking her head, ""I couldn't help you then. But you don't want my",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,50,"help anyway, it means nothing to you, you're too stubborn and won't be persuaded."" Then, after a while she asked, ""Do you have a lover?"" ""No,"" said K. ""Oh, you must have,"" she said. ""Well, I have really,"" said K. ""Just think, I've even betrayed her while I'm carrying her photograph with me."" Leni insisted he show her a photograph of Elsa, and then, hunched on his lap, studied the picture closely. The photograph was not one that had been taken while Elsa was posing for it, it showed her just after she had been in a wild dance such as she liked to do in wine bars, her skirt was still flung out as she span round, she had placed her hands on her firm hips and, with her neck held taut, looked to one side with a laugh; you could not see from the picture whom her laugh was intended for. ""She's very tightly laced,"" said Leni, pointing to the place where she thought this could be seen. ""I don't like her, she's clumsy and crude. But maybe she's gentle and friendly towards you, that's the impression you get from the picture. Big, strong girls like that often don't know how to be anything but gentle and friendly. Would she be capable of sacrificing herself for you, though?"" ""No,"" said K., ""she isn't gentle or friendly, and nor would she be capable of sacrificing herself for me. But I've never yet asked any of those things of her. I've never looked at this picture as closely as you."" ""You can't think much of her, then,"" said Leni. ""She can't be your lover after all."" ""Yes she is,"" said K., ""I'm not going to take my word back on that."" ""Well she might be your lover now, then,"" said Leni, ""but you wouldn't miss her much if you lost her or if you exchanged her for somebody else, me for instance."" ""That is certainly conceivable,"" said K. with a smile, ""but she does have one major advantage over you, she knows nothing about my trial, and even if she did she wouldn't think about it. She wouldn't try to persuade me to be les unyielding."" ""Well that's no advantage,"" said Leni. ""If she's got no advantage other than that, I can keep on hoping. Has she got any bodily defects?"" ""'Bodily defects'?"" asked K. ""Yeah,"" said Leni, ""as I do have a bodily defect, just a little one. Look."" She spread the middle and ring fingers of her right hand apart from each other. Between those fingers the flap of skin connecting them reached up almost as far as the top joint of the little finger. In the darkness, K. did not see at first what it was she wanted to show him, so she led his hand to it so that he could feel. ""What a freak of nature,"" said K., and when he had taken a look at the whole hand he added, ""What a pretty claw!"" Leni looked on with a kind of pride as K. repeatedly opened and closed her two fingers in amazement, until, finally, he briefly kissed them and let go. ""Oh!"" she immediately exclaimed, ""you kissed me!"" Hurriedly, and with her mouth open, she clambered up K.'s lap with her knees. He was almost aghast as he looked up at her, now that she was so close to him there was a bitter, irritating smell from her, like pepper, she grasped his head, leant out over him, and bit and kissed his neck, even biting into his hair. ""I've taken her place!"" she exclaimed from time to time. ""Just look, now you've taken me instead of her!"" Just then, her knee slipped out and, with a little cry, she nearly fell down onto the carpet, K. tried to hold her by putting his arms around her and was pulled down with her. ""Now you're mine,"" she said. Her last words to him as he left were, ""Here's the key to the door, come whenever you want"", and she planted an undirected kiss on his back. When he stepped out the front door there was a light rain falling, he was about to go to the middle of the street to see if he could still glimpse Leni at the window when K.'s uncle leapt out of a car that K., thinking of other things, had not seen waiting outside the building. He took hold of K. by both arms and shoved him against the door as if he wanted to nail him to it. ""Young man,"" he shouted, ""how could you do a thing like that?! Things were going well with this business of yours, now you've caused it terrible damage. You slope of with some dirty, little thing who, moreover, is",no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,51,"obviously the lawyer's beloved, and stay away for hours. You don't even try to find an excuse, don't try to hide anything, no, you're quite open about it, you run off with her and stay there. And meanwhile we're sitting there, your uncle who's going to such effort for you, the lawyer who needs to be won over to your side, and above all the office director, a very important gentleman who is in direct command of your affair in its present stage. We wanted to discuss how best to help you, I had to handle the lawyer very carefully, he had to handle the office director carefully, and you had most reason of all to at least give me some support. Instead of which you stay away. Eventually we couldn't keep up the pretence any longer, but these are polite and highly capable men, they didn't say anything about it so as to spare my feelings but in the end not even they could continue to force themselves and, as they couldn't speak about the matter in hand, they became silent. We sat there for several minutes, listening to see whether you wouldn't finally come back. All in vain. In the end the office director stood up, as he had stayed far longer than he had originally intended, made his farewell, looked at me in sympathy without being able to help, he waited at the door for a long time although it's more than I can understand why he was being so good, and then he went. I, of course, was glad he'd gone, I'd been holding my breath all this time. All this had even more affect on the lawyer lying there ill, when I took my leave of him, the good man, he was quite unable to speak. You have probably contributed to his total collapse and so brought the very man who you are dependent on closer to his death. And me, your own uncle, you leave me here in the rain - just feel this, I'm wet right through - waiting here for hours, sick with worry."" Chapter Seven Lawyer - Manufacturer - Painter One winter morning - snow was falling in the dull light outside - K. was sitting in his office, already extremely tired despite the early hour. He had told the servitor he was engaged in a major piece of work and none of the junior staff should be allowed in to see him, so he would not be disturbed by them at least. But instead of working he turned round in his chair, slowly moved various items around his desk, but then, without being aware of it, he lay his arm stretched out on the desk top and sat there immobile with his head sunk down on his chest. He was no longer able to get the thought of the trial out of his head. He had often wondered whether it might not be a good idea to work out a written defence and hand it in to the court. It would contain a short description of his life and explain why he had acted the way he had at each event that was in any way important, whether he now considered he had acted well or ill, and his reasons for each. There was no doubt of the advantages a written defence of this sort would have over relying on the lawyer, who was anyway not without his shortcomings. K. had no idea what actions the lawyer was taking; it was certainly not a lot, it was more than a month since the lawyer had summoned him, and none of the previous discussions had given K. the impression that this man would be able to do much for him. Most importantly, he had asked him hardly any questions. And there were so many questions here to be asked. Asking questions were the most important thing. K. had the feeling that he would be able to ask all the questions needed here himself. The lawyer, in contrast, did not ask questions but did all the talking himself or sat silently facing him, leant forward slightly over the desk, probably because he was hard of hearing, pulled on a strand of hair in the middle of his beard and looked down at the carpet, perhaps at the very spot where K. had lain with Leni. Now and then he would give K. some vague warning of the sort you give to children. His speeches were as pointless as they were boring, and K. decided that when the final bill came he would pay not a penny for them. Once the lawyer thought he had humiliated K. sufficiently, he usually started something that would raise his spirits again. He had already, he would",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,52,"then say, won many such cases, partly or in whole, cases which may not really have been as difficult as this one but which, on the face of it, had even less hope of success. He had a list of these cases here in the drawer - here he would tap on one or other of the drawers in his desk - but could, unfortunately, not show them to K. as they dealt with official secrets. Nonetheless, the great experience he had acquired through all these cases would, of course, be of benefit to K. He had, of course, begun work straight away and was nearly ready to submit the first documents. They would be very important because the first impression made by the defence will often determine the whole course of the proceedings. Unfortunately, though, he would still have to make it clear to K. that the first documents submitted are sometimes not even read by the court. They simply put them with the other documents and point out that, for the time being, questioning and observing the accused are much more important than anything written. If the applicant becomes insistent, then they add that before they come to any decision, as soon as all the material has been brought together, with due regard, of course, to all the documents, then these first documents to have been submitted will also be checked over. But unfortunately, even this is not usually true, the first documents submitted are usually mislaid or lost completely, and even if they do keep them right to the end they are hardly read, although the lawyer only knew about this from rumour. This is all very regrettable, but not entirely without its justifications. But K. should not forget that the trial would not be public, if the court deems it necessary it can be made public but there is no law that says it has to be. As a result, the accused and his defence don't have access even to the court records, and especially not to the indictment, and that means we generally don't know - or at least not precisely - what the first documents need to be about, which means that if they do contain anything of relevance to the case it's only by a lucky coincidence. If anything about the individual charges and the reasons for them comes out clearly or can be guessed at while the accused is being questioned, then it's possible to work out and submit documents that really direct the issue and present proof, but not before. Conditions like this, of course, place the defence in a very unfavourable and difficult position. But that is what they intend. In fact, defence is not really allowed under the law, it's only tolerated, and there is even some dispute about whether the relevant parts of the law imply even that. So strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a counsel acknowledged by the court, and anyone who comes before this court as counsel is basically no more than a barrack room lawyer. The effect of all this, of course, is to remove the dignity of the whole procedure, the next time K. is in the court offices he might like to have a look in at the lawyers' room, just so that he's seen it. He might well be quite shocked by the people he sees assembled there. The room they've been allocated, with its narrow space and low ceiling, will be enough to show what contempt the court has for these people. The only light in the room comes through a little window that is so high up that, if you want to look out of it, you first have to get one of your colleagues to support you on his back, and even then the smoke from the chimney just in front of it will go up your nose and make your face black. In the floor of this room - to give yet another example of the conditions there - there is a hole that's been there for more than a year, it's not so big that a man could fall through, but it is big enough for your foot to disappear through it. The lawyers' room is on the second floor of the attic; if your foot does go through it will hang down into the first floor of the attic underneath it, and right in the corridor where the litigants are waiting. It's no exaggeration when lawyers say that conditions like that are a disgrace. Complaints to the management don't have the slightest effect, but the lawyers are strictly forbidden to alter anything in the room at their own expense. But even treating the lawyers in this way has its reasons. They want, as",yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,53,"far as possible, to prevent any kind of defence, everything should be made the responsibility of the accused. No a bad point of view, basically, but nothing could be more mistaken than to think from that that lawyers are not necessary for the accused in this court. On the contrary, there is no court where they are less needed than here. This is because proceedings are generally kept secret not only from the public but also from the accused. Only as far as that is possible, of course, but it is possible to a very large extent. And the accused doesn't get to see the court records either, and it's very difficult to infer what's in the court records from what's been said during questioning based on them, especially for the accused who is in a difficult situation and is faced with every possible worry to distract him. This is when the defence begins. Counsel for the defence are not normally allowed to be present while the accused is being questioned, so afterwards, and if possible still at the door of the interview room, he has to learn what he can about it from him and extract whatever he can that might be of use, even though what the accused has to report is often very confused. But that is not the most important thing, as there's really not a lot that can be learned in this way, although in this, as with anything else, a competent man will learn more than another. Nonetheless, the most important thing is the lawyer's personal connections, that's where the real value of taking counsel lies. Now K. will most likely have already learned from his own experience that, among its very lowest orders, the court organisation does have its imperfections, the court is strictly closed to the public, but staff who forget their duty or who take bribes do, to some extent, show where the gaps are. This is where most lawyers will push their way in, this is where bribes are paid and information extracted, there have even, in earlier times at least, been incidents where documents have been stolen. There's no denying that some surprisingly favourable results have been attained for the accused in this way, for a limited time, and these petty advocates then strut to and fro on the basis of them and attract new clients, but for the further course of the proceedings it signifies either nothing or nothing good. The only things of real value are honest personal contacts, contacts with higher officials, albeit higher officials of the lower grades, you understand. That is the only way the progress of the trial can be influenced, hardly noticeable at first, it's true, but from then on it becomes more and more visible. There are, of course, not many lawyers who can do this, and K. has made a very good choice in this matter. There were probably no more than one or two who had as many contacts as Dr. Huld, but they don't bother with the company of the lawyers' room and have nothing to do with it. This means they have all the less contact with the court officials. It is not at all necessary for Dr. Huld to go to the court, wait in the ante-rooms for the examining judges to turn up, if they turn up, and try to achieve something which, according to the judges' mood is usually more apparent than real and most often not even that. No, K. has seen for himself that the court officials, including some who are quite high up, come forward without being asked, are glad to give information which is fully open or at least easy to understand, they discuss the next stages in the proceedings, in fact in some cases they can be won over and are quite willing to adopt the other person's point of view. However, when this happens, you should never trust them too far, as however firmly they may have declared this new point of view in favour of the defendant they might well go straight back to their offices and write a report for the court that says just the opposite, and might well be even harder on the defendant than the original view, the one they insist they've been fully dissuaded from. And, of course, there's no way of defending yourself from this, something said in private is indeed in private and cannot then be used in public, it's not something that makes it easy for the defence to keep those gentlemen's favour. On the other hand, it's also true that the gentlemen don't become involved with the defence - which will of course be done with great expertise - just for philanthropic reasons or in order to be",yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,54,"friendly, in some respects it would be truer to say that they, too, have it allocated to them. This is where the disadvantages of a court structure that, right from the start, stipulates that all proceedings take place in private, come into force. In normal, mediocre trials its officials have contact with the public, and they're very well equipped for it, but here they don't; normal trials run their course all by themselves, almost, and just need a nudge here and there; but when they're faced with cases that are especially difficult they're as lost as they often are with ones that are very simple; they're forced to spend all their time, day and night, with their laws, and so they don't have the right feel for human relationships, and that's a serious shortcoming in cases like this. That's when they come for advice to the lawyer, with a servant behind them carrying the documents which normally are kept so secret. You could have seen many gentlemen at this window, gentlemen of whom you would least expect it, staring out this window in despair on the street below while the lawyer is at his desk studying the documents so that he can give them good advice. And at times like that it's also possible to see how exceptionally seriously these gentlemen take their professions and how they are thrown into great confusion by difficulties which it's just not in their natures to overcome. But they're not in an easy position, to regard their positions as easy would be to do them an injustice. The different ranks and hierarchies of the court are endless, and even someone who knows his way around them cannot always tell what's going to happen. But even for the junior officials, the proceedings in the courtrooms are usually kept secret, so they are hardly able to see how the cases they work with proceed, court affairs appear in their range of vision often without their knowing where they come from and they move on further without their learning where they go. So civil servants like this are not able to learn the things you can learn from studying the successive stages that individual trials go through, the final verdict or the reasons for it. They're only allowed to deal with that part of the trial which the law allocates them, and they usually know less about the results of their work after it's left them than the defence does, even though the defence will usually stay in contact with the accused until the trial is nearly at its end, so that the court officials can learn many useful things from the defence. Bearing all this in mind, does it still surprise K. that the officials are irritated and often express themselves about the litigants in unflattering ways - which is an experience shared by everyone. All the officials are irritated, even when they appear calm. This causes many difficulties for the junior advocates, of course. There is a story, for instance, that has very much the ring of truth about it. It goes like this: One of the older officials, a good and peaceful man, was dealing with a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused, especially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers. He had been studying it for a day and a night without a break - as these officials are indeed hard working, no-one works as hard as they do. When it was nearly morning, and he had been working for twenty-four hours with probably very little result, he went to the front entrance, waited there in ambush, and every time a lawyer tried to enter the building he would throw him down the steps. The lawyers gathered together down in front of the steps and discussed with each other what they should do; on the one hand they had actually no right to be allowed into the building so that there was hardly anything that they could legally do to the official and, as I've already mentioned, they would have to be careful not to set all the officials against them. On the other hand, any day not spent in court is a day lost for them and it was a matter of some importance to force their way inside. In the end, they agreed that they would try to tire the old man out. One lawyer after another was sent out to run up the steps and let himself be thrown down again, offering what resistance he could as long as it was passive resistance, and his colleagues would catch him at the bottom of the steps. That went on for about an hour until the old gentleman, who was already exhausted from working all night, was very",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,55,"tired and went back to his office. Those who were at the bottom of the steps could not believe it at first, so they sent somebody out to go and look behind the door to see if there really was no-one there, and only then did they all gather together and probably didn't even dare to complain, as it's far from being the lawyers' job to introduce any improvements in the court system, or even to want to. Even the most junior lawyer can understand the relationship there to some extent, but one significant point is that almost every defendant, even very simple people, begins to think of suggestions for improving the court as soon as his proceedings have begun, many of them often even spend time and energy on the matter that could be spent far better elsewhere. The only right thing to do is to learn how to deal with the situation as it is. Even if it were possible to improve any detail of it - which is anyway no more than superstitious nonsense - the best that they could achieve, although doing themselves incalculable harm in the process, is that they will have attracted the special attention of the officials for any case that comes up in the future, and the officials are always ready to seek revenge. Never attract attention to yourself! Stay calm, however much it goes against your character! Try to gain some insight into the size of the court organism and how, to some extent, it remains in a state of suspension, and that even if you alter something in one place you'll draw the ground out from under your feet and might fall, whereas if an enormous organism like the court is disrupted in any one place it finds it easy to provide a substitute for itself somewhere else. Everything is connected with everything else and will continue without any change or else, which is quite probable, even more closed, more attentive, more strict, more malevolent. So it's best to leave the work to the lawyers and not to keep disturbing them. It doesn't do much good to make accusations, especially if you can't make it clear what they're based on and their full significance, but it must be said that K. caused a great deal of harm to his own case by his behaviour towards the office director, he was a very influential man but now he might as well be struck off the list of those who might do anything for K. If the trial is mentioned, even just in passing, it's quite obvious that he's ignoring it. These officials are in many ways just like children. Often, something quite harmless - although K.'s behaviour could unfortunately not be called harmless - will leave them feeling so offended that they will even stop talking with good friends of theirs, they turn away when they see them and do everything they can to oppose them. But then, with no particular reason, surprisingly enough, some little joke that was only ever attempted because everything seemed so hopeless will make them laugh and they'll be reconciled. It's both difficult and hard at the same time to deal with them, and there's hardly any reason for it. It's sometimes quite astonishing that a single, average life is enough to encompass so much that it's at all possible ever to have any success in one's work here. On the other hand, there are also dark moments, such as everyone has, when you think you've achieved nothing at all, when it seems that the only trials to come to a good end are those that were determined to have a good end from the start and would do so without any help, while all the others are lost despite all the running to and fro, all the effort, all the little, apparent successes that gave such joy. Then you no longer feel very sure of anything and, if asked about a trial that was doing well by its own nature but which was turned for the worse because you assisted in it, would not even dare deny that. And even that is a kind of self-confidence, but then it's the only one that's left. Lawyers are especially vulnerable to fits of depression of that sort - and they are no more than fits of depression of course - when a case is suddenly taken out of their hands after they've been conducting it satisfactorily for some time. That's probably the worst that can happen to a lawyer. It's not that the accused takes the case away from him, that hardly ever happens, once a defendant has taken on a certain lawyer he has to stay with him whatever happens. How could he ever carry on",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,56,"by himself after he's taken on help from a lawyer? No, that just doesn't happen, but what does sometimes happen is that the trial takes on a course where the lawyer may not go along with it. Client and trial are both simply taken away from the lawyer; and then even contact with the court officials won't help, however good they are, as they don't know anything themselves. The trial will have entered a stage where no more help can be given, where it's being processed in courts to which no-one has any access, where the defendant cannot even be contacted by his lawyer. You come home one day and find all the documents you've submitted, which you've worked hard to create and which you had the best hopes for, lying on the desk, they've been sent back as they can't be carried through to the next stage in the trial, they're just worthless scraps of paper. It doesn't meant that the case has been lost, not at all, or at least there is no decisive reason for supposing so, it's just that you don't know anything more about the case and won't be told anything of what's happening. Well, cases like that are the exceptions, I'm glad to say, and even if K.'s trial is one of them, it's still, for the time being, a long way off. But there was still plenty of opportunity for lawyers to get to work, and K. could be sure they would be made use of. As he had said, the time for submitting documents was still in the future and there was no rush to prepare them, it was much more important to start the initial discussions with the appropriate officials, and they had already taken place. With varying degrees of success, it must be said. It was much better not to give away any details before their time, as in that way K. could only be influenced unfavourably and his hopes might be raised or he might be made too anxious, better just to say that some individuals have spoken very favourably and shown themselves very willing to help, although others have spoken less favourably, but even they have not in any way refused to help. So all in all, the results are very encouraging, only you should certainly not draw any particular conclusions as all preliminary proceedings begin in the same way and it was only the way they developed further that would show what the value of these preliminary proceedings has been. Anyway, nothing has been lost yet, and if we can succeed in getting the office director, despite everything, on our side - and several actions have been undertaken to this end - then everything is a clean wound, as a surgeon would say, and we can wait for the results with some comfort. When he started talking on in this way the lawyer was quite tireless. He went through it all again every time K. went to see him. There was always some progress, but he could never be told what sort of progress it was. The first set of documents to be submitted were being worked on but still not ready, which usually turned out to be a great advantage the next time K. went to see him as the earlier occasion would have been a very bad time to put them in, which they could not then have known. If K., stupefied from all this talking, ever pointed out that even considering all these difficulties progress was very slow, the lawyer would object that progress was not slow at all, but that they might have progressed far further if K. had come to him at the right time. But he had come to him late and that lateness would bring still further difficulties, and not only where time was concerned. The only welcome interruption during these visits was always when Leni contrived to bring the lawyer his tea while K. was there. Then she would stand behind K. - pretending to watch the lawyer as he bent greedily over his cup, poured the tea in and drank - and secretly let K. hold her hand. There was always complete silence. The lawyer drank. K. squeezed Leni's hand and Leni would sometimes dare to gently stroke K.'s hair. ""Still here, are you?"" the lawyer would ask when he was ready. ""I wanted to take the dishes away,"" said Leni, they would give each other's hands a final squeeze, the lawyer would wipe his mouth and then start talking at K. again with renewed energy. Was the lawyer trying to comfort K. or to confuse him? K. could not tell, but it seemed clear to him that his defence was not in good hands. Maybe everything the",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,57,"lawyer said was quite right, even though he obviously wanted to make himself as conspicuous as possible and probably had never even taken on a case as important as he said K.'s was. But it was still suspicious how he continually mentioned his personal contacts with the civil servants. Were they to be exploited solely for K.'s benefit? The lawyer never forgot to mention that they were dealing only with junior officials, which meant officials who were dependent on others, and the direction taken in each trial could be important for their own furtherment. Could it be that they were making use of the lawyer to turn trials in a certain direction, which would, of course, always be at the cost of the defendant? It certain did not mean that they would do that in every trial, that was not likely at all, and there were probably also trials where they gave the lawyer advantages and all the room he needed to turn it in the direction he wanted, as it would also be to their advantage to keep his reputation intact. If that really was their relationship, how would they direct K.'s trial which, as the lawyer had explained, was especially difficult and therefore important enough to attract great attention from the very first time it came to court? There could not be much doubt about what they would do. The first signs of it could already be seen in the fact that the first documents still had not been submitted even though the trial had already lasted several months, and that, according to the lawyer, everything was still in its initial stages, which was very effective, of course, in making the defendant passive and keeping him helpless. Then he could be suddenly surprised with the verdict, or at least with a notification that the hearing had not decided in his favour and the matter would be passed on to a higher office. It was essential that K. take a hand in it himself. On winter's mornings such as this, when he was very tired and everything dragged itself lethargically through his head, this belief of his seemed irrefutable. He no longer felt the contempt for the trial that he had had earlier. If he had been alone in the world it would have been easy for him to ignore it, although it was also certain that, in that case, the trial would never have arisen in the first place. But now, his uncle had already dragged him to see the lawyer, he had to take account of his family; his job was no longer totally separate from the progress of the trial, he himself had carelessly - with a certain, inexplicable complacency - mentioned it to acquaintances and others had learned about it in ways he did not know, his relationship with Miss Brstner seemed to be in trouble because of it. In short, he no longer had any choice whether he would accept the trial or turn it down, he was in the middle of it and had to defend himself. If he was tired, then that was bad. But there was no reason to worry too much before he needed to. He had been capable of working himself up to his high position in the bank in a relatively short time and to retain it with respect from everyone, now he simply had to apply some of the talents that had made that possible for him to the trial, and there was no doubt that it had to turn out well. The most important thing, if something was to be achieved, was to reject in advance any idea that he might be in any way guilty. There was no guilt. The trial was nothing but a big piece of business, just like he had already concluded to the benefit of the bank many times, a piece of business that concealed many lurking dangers waiting in ambush for him, as they usually did, and these dangers would need to be defended against. If that was to be achieved then he must not entertain any idea of guilt, whatever he did, he would need to look after his own interests as closely as he could. Seen in this way, there was no choice but to take his representation away from the lawyer very soon, at best that very evening. The lawyer had told him, as he talked to him, that that was something unheard of and would probably do him a great deal of harm, but K. could not tolerate any impediment to his efforts where his trial was concerned, and these impediments were probably caused by the lawyer himself. But once he had shaken off the lawyer the documents would need to be submitted straight away and,",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,58,"if possible, he would need to see to it that they were being dealt with every day. It would of course not be enough, if that was to be done, for K. to sit in the corridor with his hat under the bench like the others. Day after day, he himself, or one of the women or somebody else on his behalf, would have to run after the officials and force them to sit at their desks and study K.'s documents instead of looking out on the corridor through the grating. There could be no let-up in these efforts, everything would need to be organised and supervised, it was about time that the court came up against a defendant who knew how to defend and make use of his rights. But when K. had the confidence to try and do all this the difficulty of composing the documents was too much for him. Earlier, just a week or so before, he could only have felt shame at the thought of being made to write out such documents himself; it had never entered his head that the task could also be difficult. He remembered one morning when, already piled up with work, he suddenly shoved everything to one side and took a pad of paper on which he sketched out some of his thoughts on how documents of this sort should proceed. Perhaps he would offer them to that slow-witted lawyer, but just then the door of the manager's office opened and the deputy-director entered the room with a loud laugh. K. was very embarrassed, although the deputy-director, of course, was not laughing at K.'s documents, which he knew nothing about, but at a joke he had just heard about the stock-exchange, a joke which needed an illustration if it was to be understood, and now the deputy-director leant over K.'s desk, took his pencil from his hand, and drew the illustration on the writing pad that K. had intended for his ideas about his case. K. now had no more thoughts of shame, the documents had to be prepared and submitted. If, as was very likely, he could find no time to do it in the office he would have to do it at home at night. If the nights weren't enough he would have to take a holiday. Above he could not stop half way, that was nonsense not only in business but always and everywhere. Needless to say, the documents would mean an almost endless amount of work. It was easy to come to the belief, not only for those of an anxious disposition, that it was impossible ever to finish it. This was not because of laziness or deceit, which were the only things that might have hindered the lawyer in preparing it, but because he did not know what the charge was or even what consequences it might bring, so that he had to remember every tiny action and event from the whole of his life, looking at them from all sides and checking and reconsidering them. It was also a very disheartening job. It would have been more suitable as a way of passing the long days after he had retired and become senile. But now, just when K. needed to apply all his thoughts to his work, when he was still rising and already posed a threat to the deputy- director, when every hour passed so quickly and he wanted to enjoy the brief evenings and nights as a young man, this was the time he had to start working out these documents. Once more, he began to feel resentment. Almost involuntarily, only to put an end to it, his finger felt for the button of the electric bell in the ante-room. As he pressed it he glanced up to the clock. It was eleven o'clock, two hours, he had spent a great deal of his costly time just dreaming and his wits were, of course, even more dulled than they had been before. But the time had, nonetheless, not been wasted, he had come to some decisions that could be of value. As well as various pieces of mail, the servitors brought two visiting cards from gentlemen who had already been waiting for K. for some time. They were actually very important clients of the bank who should not really have been kept waiting under any circumstances. Why had they come at such an awkward time, and why, the gentlemen on the other side of the closed door seemed to be asking, was the industrious K. using up the best business time for his private affairs? Tired from what had gone before, and tired in anticipation of what was to follow, K. stood up to receive the first of them. He was a",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,59,"short, jolly man, a manufacturer who K. knew well. He apologised for disturbing K. at some important work, and K., for his part, apologised for having kept the manufacturer waiting for so long. But even this apology was spoken in such a mechanical way and with such false intonation that the manufacturer would certainly have noticed if he had not been fully preoccupied with his business affairs. Instead, he hurriedly pulled calculations and tables out from all his pockets, spread them out in front of K., explained several items, corrected a little mistake in the arithmetic that he noticed as he quickly glanced over it all, and reminded K. of a similar piece of business he'd concluded with him about a year before, mentioning in passing that this time there was another bank spending great effort to get his business, and finally stopped speaking in order to learn K.'s opinion on the matter. And K. had indeed, at first, been closely following what the manufacturer was saying, he too was aware of how important the deal was, but unfortunately it did not last, he soon stopped listening, nodded at each of the manufacturer's louder exclamations for a short while, but eventually he stopped doing even that and did no more than stare at the bald head bent over the papers, asking himself when the manufacturer would finally realise that everything he was saying was useless. When he did stop talking, K. really thought at first that this was so that he would have the chance to confess that he was incapable of listening. Instead, seeing the anticipation on the manufacturer's face, obviously ready to counter any objections made, he was sorry to realise that the business discussion had to be continued. So he bent his head as if he'd been given an order and began slowly to move his pencil over the papers, now and then he would stop and stare at one of the figures. The manufacturer thought there must be some objection, perhaps his figures weren't really sound, perhaps they weren't the decisive issue, whatever he thought, the manufacturer covered the papers with his hand and began once again, moving very close to K., to explain what the deal was all about. ""It is difficult,"" said K., pursing his lips. The only thing that could offer him any guidance were the papers, and the manufacturer had covered them from his view, so he just sank back against the arm of the chair. Even when the door of the manager's office opened and revealed not very clearly, as if through a veil, the deputy director, he did no more than look up weakly. K. thought no more about the matter, he merely watched the immediate effect of the deputy director's appearance and, for him, the effect was very pleasing; the manufacturer immediately jumped up from his seat and hurried over to meet the deputy director, although K. would have liked to make him ten times livelier as he feared the deputy director might disappear again. He need not have worried, the two gentlemen met each other, shook each other's hand and went together over to K.'s desk. The manufacturer said he was sorry to find the chief clerk so little inclined to do business, pointing to K. who, under the view of the deputy director, had bent back down over the papers. As the two men leant over the desk and the manufacturer made some effort to gain and keep the deputy director's attention, K. felt as if they were much bigger than they really were and that their negotiations were about him. Carefully and slowly turning his eyes upwards, he tried to learn what was taking place above him, took one of the papers from his desk without looking to see what it was, lay it on the flat of his hand and raised it slowly up as he rose up to the level of the two men himself. He had no particular plan in mind as he did this, but merely felt this was how he would act if only he had finished preparing that great document that was to remove his burden entirely. The deputy director had been paying all his attention to the conversation and did no more than glance at the paper, he did not read what was written on it at all as what was important for the chief clerk was not important for him, he took it from K.'s hand saying, ""Thank you, I'm already familiar with everything"", and lay it calmly back on the desk. K. gave him a bitter, sideways look. But the deputy director did not notice this at all, or if he did notice it it only raised his spirits, he frequently laughed out loud, one time he",no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,60,"clearly embarrassed the manufacturer when he raised an objection in a witty way but drew him immediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely on himself, and finally invited him into his office where they could bring the matter to its conclusion. ""It's a very important matter,"" said the manufacturer. ""I understand that completely. And I'm sure the chief clerk ..."" - even as he said this he was actually speaking only to the manufacturer - ""will be very glad to have us take it off his hands. This is something that needs calm consideration. But he seems to be over-burdened today, there are even some people in the room outside who've been waiting there for hours for him."" K. still had enough control of himself to turn away from the deputy director and direct his friendly, albeit stiff, smile only at the manufacturer, he made no other retaliation, bent down slightly and supported himself with both hands on his desk like a clerk, and watched as the two gentlemen, still talking, took the papers from his desk and disappeared into the manager's office. In the doorway, the manufacturer turned and said he wouldn't make his farewell with K. just yet, he would of course let the chief clerk know about the success of his discussions but he also had a little something to tell him about. At last, K. was by himself. It did not enter his head to show anyone else into his office and only became vaguely aware of how nice it was that the people outside thought he was still negotiating with the manufacturer and, for this reason, he could not let anyone in to see him, not even the servitor. He went over to the window, sat down on the ledge beside it, held firmly on to the handle and looked down onto the square outside. The snow was still falling, the weather still had not brightened up at all. He remained a long time sitting in this way, not knowing what it actually was that made him so anxious, only occasionally did he glance, slightly startled, over his shoulder at the door to the outer room where, mistakenly, he thought he'd heard some noise. No- one came, and that made him feel calmer, he went over to the wash stand, rinsed his face with cold water and, his head somewhat clearer, went back to his place by the window. The decision to take his defence into his own hands now seemed more of a burden than he had originally assumed. All the while he had left his defence up to the lawyer his trial had had little basic affect on him, he had observed it from afar as something that was scarcely able to reach him directly, when it suited him he looked to see how things stood but he was also able to draw his head back again whenever he wanted. Now, in contrast, if he was to conduct his defence himself, he would have to devote himself entirely to the court - for the time being, at least - success would mean, later on, his complete and conclusive liberation, but if he was to achieve this he would have to place himself, to start with, in far greater danger than he had been in so far. If he ever felt tempted to doubt this, then his experience with the deputy director and the manufacturer that day would be quite enough to convince him of it. How could he have sat there totally convinced of the need to do his own defence? How would it be later? What would his life be like in the days ahead? Would he find the way through it all to a happy conclusion? Did a carefully worked out defence - and any other sort would have made no sense - did a carefully worked out defence not also mean he would need to shut himself off from everything else as much as he could? Would he survive that? And how was he to succeed in conducting all this at the bank? It involved much more than just submitting some documents that he could probably prepare in a few days' leave, although it would have been great temerity to ask for time off from the bank just at that time, it was a whole trial and there was no way of seeing how long it might last. This was an enormous difficulty that had suddenly been thrown into K.'s life! And was he supposed to be doing the bank's work at a time like this? He looked down at his desk. Was he supposed to let people in to see him and go into negotiations with them at a time like this? While his trial trundled on,",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,61,"while the court officials upstairs in the attic room sat looking at the papers for this trial, should he be worrying about the business of the bank? Did this not seem like a kind of torture, acknowledged by the court, connected with the trial and which followed him around? And is it likely that anyone in the bank, when judging his work, would take any account of his peculiar situation? No-one and never. There were those who knew about his trial, although it was not quite clear who knew about it or how much. But he hoped rumours had not reached as far as the deputy director, otherwise he would obviously soon find a way of making use of it to harm K., he would show neither comradeship nor humaneness. And what about the director? It was true that he was well disposed towards K., and as soon as he heard about the trial he would probably try to do everything he could to make it easier for him, but he would certainly not devote himself to it. K. at one time had provided the counter-balance to what the deputy director said but the director was now coming more and more under his influence, and the deputy director would also exploit the weakened condition of the director to strengthen his own power. So what could K. hope for? Maybe considerations of this sort weakened his power of resistance, but it was still necessary not to deceive oneself and to see everything as clearly as it could be seen at that moment. For no particular reason, just to avoiding returning to his desk for a while, he opened the window. It was difficult to open and he had to turn the handle with both his hands. Then, through the whole height and breadth of the window, the mixture of fog and smoke was drawn into the room, filling it with a slight smell of burning. A few flakes of snow were blown in with it. ""It's a horrible autumn,"" said the manufacturer, who had come into the room unnoticed after seeing the deputy director and now stood behind K. K. nodded and looked uneasily at the manufacturer's briefcase, from which he would now probably take the papers and inform K. of the result of his negotiations with the deputy director. However, the manufacturer saw where K. was looking, knocked on his briefcase and without opening it said, ""You'll be wanting to hear how things turned out. I've already got the contract in my pocket, almost. He's a charming man, your deputy director - he's got his dangers, though."" He laughed as he shook K.'s hand and wanted to make him laugh with him. But to K., it once more seemed suspicious that the manufacturer did not want to show him the papers and saw nothing about his comments to laugh at. ""Chief clerk,"" said the manufacturer, ""I expect the weather's been affecting your mood, has it? You're looking so worried today."" ""Yes,"" said K., raising his hand and holding the temple of his head, ""headaches, worries in the family."" ""Quite right,"" said the manufacturer, who was always in a hurry and could never listen to anyone for very long, ""everyone has his cross to bear."" K. had unconsciously made a step towards the door as if wanting to show the manufacturer out, but the manufacturer said, ""Chief clerk, there's something else I'd like to mention to you. I'm very sorry if it's something that'll be a burden to you today of all days but I've been to see you twice already, lately, and each time I forgot all about it. If I delay it any longer it might well lose its point altogether. That would be a pity, as I think what I've got to say does have some value."" Before K. had had the time to answer, the manufacturer came up close to him, tapped his knuckle lightly on his chest and said quietly, ""You've got a trial going on, haven't you?"" K. stepped back and immediately exclaimed, ""That's what the deputy director's been telling you!"" ""No, no,"" said the manufacturer, ""how would the deputy director know about it?"" ""And what about you?"" asked K., already more in control of himself. ""I hear things about the court here and there,"" said the manufacturer, ""and that even applies to what it is that I wanted to tell you about."" ""There are so many people who have connections with the court!"" said K. with lowered head, and he led the manufacturer over to his desk. They sat down where they had been before, and the manufacturer said, ""I'm afraid it's not very much that I've got to tell you about. Only, in matters like this, it's best not to overlook the tiniest",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,62,"details. Besides, I really want to help you in some way, however modest my help might be. We've been good business partners up till now, haven't we? Well then."" K. wanted to apologise for his behaviour in the conversation earlier that day, but the manufacturer would tolerate no interruption, shoved his briefcase up high in his armpit to show that he was in a hurry, and carried on. ""I know about your case through a certain Titorelli. He's a painter, Titorelli's just his artistic name, I don't even know what his real name is. He's been coming to me in my office for years from time to time, and brings little pictures with him which I buy more or less just for the sake of charity as he's hardly more than a beggar. And they're nice pictures, too, moorland landscapes and that sort of thing. We'd both got used to doing business in this way and it always went smoothly. Only, one time these visits became a bit too frequent, I began to tell him off for it, we started talking and I became interested how it was that he could earn a living just by painting, and then I learned to my amazement that his main source of income was painting portraits. 'I work for the court,' he said, 'what court?' said I. And that's when he told me about the court. I'm sure you can imagine how amazed I was at being told all this. Ever since then I learn something new about the court every time he comes to visit, and so little by little I get to understand something of how it works. Anyway, Titorelli talks a lot and I often have to push him away, not only because he's bound to be lying but also, most of all, because a businessman like me who's already close to breaking point under the weight of his own business worries can't pay too much attention to other people's. But all that's just by the by. Perhaps - this is what I've been thinking - perhaps Titorelli might be able to help you in some small way, he knows lots of judges and even if he can't have much influence himself he can give you some advice about how to get some influential people on your side. And even if this advice doesn't turn out to make all the difference I still think it'll be very important once you've got it. You're nearly a lawyer yourself. That's what I always say, Mr. K. the chief clerk is nearly a lawyer. Oh I'm sure this trial of yours will turn out all right. So do you want to go and see Titorelli, then? If I ask him to he'll certainly do everything he possibly can. I really do think you ought to go. It needn't be today, of course, just some time, when you get the chance. And anyway - I want to tell you this too - you don't actually have to go and see Titorelli, this advice from me doesn't place you under any obligation at all. No, if you think you can get by without Titorelli it'll certainly be better to leave him completely out of it. Maybe you've already got a clear idea of what you're doing and Titorelli could upset your plans. No, if that's the case then of course you shouldn't go there under any circumstances! And it certainly won't be easy to take advice from a lad like that. Still, it's up to you. Here's the letter of recommendation and here's the address."" Disappointed, K. took the letter and put it in his pocket. Even at best, the advantage he might derive from this recommendation was incomparably smaller than the damage that lay in the fact of the manufacturer knowing about his trial, and that the painter was spreading the news about. It was all he could mange to give the manufacturer, who was already on his way to the door, a few words of thanks. ""I'll go there,"" he said as he took his leave of the manufacturer at the door, ""or, as I'm very busy at present, I'll write to him, perhaps he would like to come to me in my office some time."" ""I was sure you'd find the best solution,"" said the manufacturer. ""Although I had thought you'd prefer to avoid inviting people like this Titorelli to the bank and talking about the trial here. And it's not always a good idea to send letters to people like Titorelli, you don't know what might happen to them. But you're bound to have thought everything through and you know what you can and can't do."" K. nodded and accompanied the manufacturer on through the ante-room. But despite seeming calm on",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,63,"the outside he was actually very shocked; he had told the manufacturer he would write to Titorelli only to show him in some way that he valued his recommendations and would consider the opportunity to speak with Titorelli without delay, but if he had thought Titorelli could offer any worthwhile assistance he would not have delayed. But it was only the manufacturer's comment that made K. realise what dangers that could lead to. Was he really able to rely on his own understanding so little? If it was possible that he might invite a questionable character into the bank with a clear letter, and ask advice from him about his trial, separated from the deputy director by no more than a door, was it not possible or even very likely that there were also other dangers he had failed to see or that he was even running towards? There was not always someone beside him to warn him. And just now, just when he would have to act with all the strength he could muster, now a number of doubts of a sort he had never before known had presented themselves and affected his own vigilance! The difficulties he had been feeling in carrying out his office work; were they now going to affect the trial too? Now, at least, he found himself quite unable to understand how he could have intended to write to Titorelli and invite him into the bank. He shook his head at the thought of it once more as the servitor came up beside him and drew his attention to the three gentlemen who were waiting on a bench in the ante-room. They had already been waiting to see K. for a long time. Now that the servitor was speaking with K. they had stood up and each of them wanted to make use of the opportunity to see K. before the others. It had been negligent of the bank to let them waste their time here in the waiting room, but none of them wanted to draw attention to this. ""Mr. K., ..."" one of them was saying, but K. had told the servitor to fetch his winter coat and said to the three of them, as the servitor helped him to put it on, ""Please forgive me, gentlemen, I'm afraid I have no time to see you at present. Please do forgive me but I have some urgent business to settle and have to leave straight away. You've already seen yourselves how long I've been delayed. Would you be so kind as to come back tomorrow or some time? Or perhaps we could settle your affairs by telephone? Or perhaps you would like to tell me now, briefly, what it's about and I can then give you a full answer in writing. Whatever, the best thing will be for you to come here again."" The gentlemen now saw that their wait had been totally pointless, and these suggestions of K.'s left them so astounded that they looked at each other without a word. ""That's agreed then, is it?"" asked K., who had turned toward the servitor bringing him his hat. Through the open door of K.'s office they could see that the snowfall outside had become much heavier. So K. turned the collar of his coat up and buttoned it up high under his chin. Just then the deputy director came out of the adjoining room, smiled as he saw K. negotiating with the gentlemen in his winter coat, and asked, ""Are you about to go out?"" ""Yes,"" said K., standing more upright, ""I have to go out on some business."" But the deputy director had already turned towards the gentlemen. ""And what about these gentlemen?"" he asked. ""I think they've already been waiting quite a long time."" ""We've already come to an understanding,"" said K. But now the gentlemen could be held back no longer, they surrounded K. and explained that they would not have been waiting for hours if it had not been about something important that had to be discussed now, at length and in private. The deputy director listened to them for a short while, he also looked at K. as he held his hat in his hand cleaning the dust off it here and there, and then he said, ""Gentlemen, there is a very simple way to solve this. If you would prefer it, I'll be very glad to take over these negotiations instead of the chief clerk. Your business does, of course, need to be discussed without delay. We are businessmen like yourselves and know the value of a businessman's time. Would you like to come this way?"" And he opened the door leading to the ante-room of his own office. The deputy director seemed very good",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,64,"at appropriating everything that K. was now forced to give up! But was K. not giving up more than he absolutely had to? By running off to some unknown painter, with, as he had to admit, very little hope of any vague benefit, his renown was suffering damage that could not me repaired. It would probably be much better to take off his winter coat again and, at the very least, try to win back the two gentlemen who were certainly still waiting in the next room. If K. had not then glimpsed the deputy director in his office, looking for something from his bookshelves as if they were his own, he would probably even have made the attempt. As K., somewhat agitated, approached the door the deputy director called out, ""Oh, you've still not left!"" He turned his face toward him - its many deep folds seemed to show strength rather than age - and immediately began once more to search. ""I'm looking for a copy of a contract,"" he said, ""which this gentleman insists you must have. Could you help me look for it, do you think?"" K. made a step forward, but the deputy director said, ""thank you, I've already found it,"" and with a big package of papers, which certainly must have included many more documents than just the copy of the contract, he turned and went back into his own office. ""I can't deal with him right now,"" K. said to himself, ""but once my personal difficulties have been settled, then he'll certainly be the first to get the effect of it, and he certainly won't like it."" Slightly calmed by these thoughts, K. gave the servitor, who had already long been holding the door to the corridor open for him, the task of telling the director, when he was able, that K. was going out of the bank on a business matter. As he left the bank he felt almost happy at the thought of being able to devote more of himself to his own business for a while. He went straight to the painter, who lived in an outlying part of town which was very near to the court offices, although this area was even poorer, the houses were darker, the streets were full of dirt that slowly blew about over the half-melted snow. In the great gateway to the building where the painter lived only one of the two doors was open, a hole had been broken open in the wall by the other door, and as K. approached it a repulsive, yellow, steaming liquid shot out causing some rats to scurry away into the nearby canal. Down by the staircase there was a small child lying on its belly crying, but it could hardly be heard because of the noise from a metal-workshop on the other side of the entrance hall, drowning out any other sound. The door to the workshop was open, three workers stood in a circle around some piece of work that they were beating with hammers. A large tin plate hung on the wall, casting a pale light that pushed its way in between two of the workers, lighting up their faces and their work-aprons. K. did no more that glance at any of these things, he wanted to get things over with here as soon as possible, to exchange just a few words to find out how things stood with the painter and go straight back to the bank. Even if he had just some tiny success here it would still have a good effect on his work at the bank for that day. On the third floor he had to slow down his pace, he was quite out of breath - the steps, just like the height of each floor, were much higher than they needed to be and he'd been told that the painter lived right up in the attic. The air was also quite oppressive, there was no proper stairwell and the narrow steps were closed in by walls on both sides with no more than a small, high window here and there. Just as K. paused for a while some young girls ran out of one of the flats and rushed higher up the stairs, laughing. K. followed them slowly, caught up with one of the girls who had stumbled and been left behind by the others, and asked her as they went up side by side, ""Is there a painter, Titorelli, who lives here?"" The girl, hardly thirteen years old and somewhat hunchbacked, jabbed him with her elbow and looked at him sideways. Her youth and her bodily defects had done nothing to stop her being already quite depraved. She did not smile once, but looked at K. earnestly, with sharp,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,65,"acquisitive eyes. K. pretended not to notice her behaviour and asked, ""Do you know Titorelli, the painter?"" She nodded and asked in reply, ""What d'you want to see him for?"" K. thought it would be to his advantage quickly to find out something more about Titorelli. ""I want to have him paint my portrait,"" he said. ""Paint your portrait?"" she asked, opening her mouth too wide and lightly hitting K. with her hand as if he had said something extraordinarily surprising or clumsy, with both hands she lifted her skirt, which was already very short, and, as fast as she could, she ran off after the other girls whose indistinct shouts lost themselves in the heights. At the next turn of the stairs, however, K. encountered all the girls once more. The hunchbacked girl had clearly told them about K.'s intentions and they were waiting for him. They stood on both sides of the stairs, pressing themselves against the wall so that K. could get through between them, and smoothed their aprons down with their hands. All their faces, even in this guard of honour, showed a mixture of childishness and depravity. Up at the head of the line of girls, who now, laughing, began to close in around K., was the hunchback who had taken on the role of leader. It was thanks to her that K. found the right direction without delay - he would have continued up the stairs straight in front of him, but she showed him that to reach Titorelli he would need to need to turn off to one side. The steps that led up to the painter were especially narrow, very long without any turning, the whole length could be seen in one glance and, at the top, at Titorelli's closed door, it came to its end. This door was much better illuminated than the rest of the stairway by the light from a small skylight set obliquely above it, it had been put together from unpainted planks of wood and the name 'Titorelli' was painted on it in broad, red brushstrokes. K. was no more than half way up the steps, accompanied by his retinue of girls, when, clearly the result of the noise of all those footsteps, the door opened slightly and in the crack a man who seemed to be dressed in just his nightshirt appeared. ""Oh!"" he cried, when he saw the approaching crowd, and vanished. The hunchbacked girl clapped her hands in glee and the other girls crowded in behind K. to push him faster forward. They still had not arrived at the top, however, when the painter up above them suddenly pulled the door wide open and, with a deep bow, invited K. to enter. The girls, on the other hand, he tried to keep away, he did not want to let any of them in however much they begged him and however much they tried to get in - if they could not get in with his permission they would try to force their way in against his will. The only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through under his outstretched arm, but the painter chased after her, grabbed her by the skirt, span her once round and set her down again by the door with the other girls who, unlike the first, had not dared to cross the doorstep while the painter had left his post. K. did not know what he was to make of all this, as they all seemed to be having fun. One behind the other, the girls by the door stretched their necks up high and called out various words to the painter which were meant in jest but which K. did not understand, and even the painter laughed as the hunchback whirled round in his hand. Then he shut the door, bowed once more to K., offered him his hand and introduced himself, saying, ""Titorelli, painter"". K. pointed to the door, behind which the girls were whispering, and said, ""You seem to be very popular in this building."" ""Ach, those brats!"" said the painter, trying in vain to fasten his nightshirt at the neck. He was also bare-footed and, apart from that, was wearing nothing more than a loose pair of yellowish linen trousers held up with a belt whose free end whipped to and fro. ""Those kids are a real burden for me,"" he continued. The top button of his nightshirt came off and he gave up trying to fasten it, fetched a chair for K. and made him sit down on it. ""I painted one of them once - she's not here today - and ever since then they've been following me about. If I'm here they only come in when I allow it,",no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,66,"but as soon as I've gone out there's always at least one of them in here. They had a key made to my door and lend it round to each other. It's hard to imagine what a pain that is. Suppose I come back home with a lady I'm going to paint, I open the door with my own key and find the hunchback there or something, by the table painting her lips red with my paintbrush, and meanwhile her little sisters will be keeping guard for her, moving about and causing chaos in every corner of the room. Or else, like happened yesterday, I might come back home late in the evening - please forgive my appearance and the room being in a mess, it is to do with them - so, I might come home late in the evening and want to go to bed, then I feel something pinching my leg, look under the bed and pull another of them out from under it. I don't know why it is they bother me like this, I expect you've just seen that I do nothing to encourage them to come near me. And they make it hard for me to do my work too, of course. If I didn't get this studio for nothing I'd have moved out a long time ago."" Just then, a little voice, tender and anxious, called out from under the door, ""Titorelli, can we come in now?"" ""No,"" answered the painter. ""Not even just me, by myself?"" the voice asked again. ""Not even just you,"" said the painter, as he went to the door and locked it. Meanwhile, K. had been looking round the room, if it had not been pointed out it would never have occurred to him that this wretched little room could be called a studio. It was hardly long enough or broad enough to make two steps. Everything, floor, walls and ceiling, was made of wood, between the planks narrow gaps could be seen. Across from where K. was, the bed stood against the wall under a covering of many different colours. In the middle of the room a picture stood on an easel, covered over with a shirt whose arms dangled down to the ground. Behind K. was the window through which the fog made it impossible to see further than the snow covered roof of the neighbouring building. The turning of the key in the lock reminded K. that he had not wanted to stay too long. So he drew the manufacturer's letter out from his pocket, held it out to the painter and said, ""I learned about you from this gentleman, an acquaintance of yours, and it's on his advice that I've come here"". The painter glanced through the letter and threw it down onto the bed. If the manufacturer had not said very clearly that Titorelli was an acquaintance of his, a poor man who was dependent on his charity, then it would really have been quite possible to believe that Titorelli did not know him or at least that he could not remember him. This impression was augmented by the painter's asking, ""Were you wanting to buy some pictures or did you want to have yourself painted?"" K. looked at the painter in astonishment. What did the letter actually say? K. had taken it as a matter of course that the manufacturer had explained to the painter in his letter that K. wanted nothing more with him than to find out more about his trial. He had been far too rash in coming here! But now he had to give the painter some sort of answer and, glancing at the easel, said, ""Are you working on a picture currently?"" ""Yes,"" said the painter, and he took the shirt hanging over the easel and threw it onto the bed after the letter. ""It's a portrait. Quite a good piece of work, although it's not quite finished yet."" This was a convenient coincidence for K., it gave him a good opportunity to talk about the court as the picture showed, very clearly, a judge. What's more, it was remarkably similar to the picture in the lawyer's office, although this one showed a quite different judge, a heavy man with a full beard which was black and bushy and extended to the sides far up the man's cheeks. The lawyer's picture was also an oil painting, whereas this one had been made with pastel colours and was pale and unclear. But everything else about the picture was similar, as this judge, too, was holding tightly to the arm of his throne and seemed ominously about to rise from it. At first K. was about to say, ""He certainly is a judge,"" but he held himself back for",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,67,"the time being and went closer to the picture as if he wanted to study it in detail. There was a large figure shown in middle of the throne's back rest which K. could not understand and asked the painter about it. That'll need some more work done on it, the painter told him, and taking a pastel crayon from a small table he added a few strokes to the edges of the figure but without making it any clearer as far as K. could make out. ""That's the figure of justice,"" said the painter, finally. ""Now I see,"" said K., ""here's the blindfold and here are the scales. But aren't those wings on her heels, and isn't she moving?"" ""Yes,"" said the painter, ""I had to paint it like that according to the contract. It's actually the figure of justice and the goddess of victory all in one."" ""That is not a good combination,"" said K. with a smile. ""Justice needs to remain still, otherwise the scales will move about and it won't be possible to make a just verdict."" ""I'm just doing what the client wanted,"" said the painter. ""Yes, certainly,"" said K., who had not meant to criticise anyone by that comment. ""You've painted the figure as it actually appears on the throne."" ""No,"" said the painter, ""I've never seen that figure or that throne, it's all just invention, but they told me what it was I had to paint."" ""How's that?"" asked K. pretending not fully to understand what the painter said. ""That is a judge sitting on the judge's chair, isn't it?"" ""Yes, "" said the painter, ""but that judge isn't very high up and he's never sat on any throne like that."" ""And he has himself painted in such a grand pose? He's sitting there just like the president of the court."" ""Yeah, gentlemen like this are very vain,"" said the painter. ""But they have permission from higher up to get themselves painted like this. It's laid down quite strictly just what sort of portrait each of them can get for himself. Only it's a pity that you can't make out the details of his costume and pose in this picture, pastel colours aren't really suitable for showing people like this."" ""Yes,"" said K., ""it does seem odd that it's in pastel colours."" ""That's what the judge wanted,"" said the painter, ""it's meant to be for a woman."" The sight of the picture seemed to make him feel like working, he rolled up his shirtsleeves, picked up a few of the crayons, and K. watched as a reddish shadow built up around the head of the judge under their quivering tips and radiated out the to edges of the picture. This shadow play slowly surrounded the head like a decoration or lofty distinction. But around the figure of Justice, apart from some coloration that was barely noticeable, it remained light, and in this brightness the figure seemed to shine forward so that it now looked like neither the God of Justice nor the God of Victory, it seemed now, rather, to be a perfect depiction of the God of the Hunt. K. found the painter's work more engrossing than he had wanted; but finally he reproached himself for staying so long without having done anything relevant to his own affair. ""What's the name of this judge?"" he asked suddenly. ""I'm not allowed to tell you that,"" the painter answered. He was bent deeply over the picture and clearly neglecting his guest who, at first, he had received with such care. K. took this to be just a foible of the painter's, and it irritated him as it made him lose time. ""I take it you must be a trustee of the court,"" he said. The painter immediately put his crayons down, stood upright, rubbed his hands together and looked at K. with a smile. ""Always straight out with the truth,"" he said. ""You want to learn something about the court, like it says in your letter of recommendation, but then you start talking about my pictures to get me on your side. Still, I won't hold it against you, you weren't to know that that was entirely the wrong thing to try with me. Oh, please!"" he said sharply, repelling K.'s attempt to make some objection. He then continued, ""And besides, you're quite right in your comment that I'm a trustee of the court."" He made a pause, as if wanting to give K. the time to come to terms with this fact. The girls could once more be heard from behind the door. They were probably pressed around the keyhole, perhaps they could even see into the room through the gaps in the planks. K. forewent the opportunity to excuse himself in some",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,68,"way as he did not wish to distract the painter from what he was saying, or else perhaps he didn't want him to get too far above himself and in this way make himself to some extent unattainable, so he asked, ""Is that a publicly acknowledged position?"" ""No,"" was the painter's curt reply, as if the question prevented him saying any more. But K. wanted him to continue speaking and said, ""Well, positions like that, that aren't officially acknowledged, can often have more influence than those that are."" ""And that's how it is with me,"" said the painter, and nodded with a frown. ""I was talking about your case with the manufacturer yesterday, and he asked me if I wouldn't like to help you, and I answered: 'He can come and see me if he likes', and now I'm pleased to see you here so soon. This business seems to be quite important to you, and, of course, I'm not surprised at that. Would you not like to take your coat off now?"" K. had intended to stay for only a very short time, but the painter's invitation was nonetheless very welcome. The air in the room had slowly become quite oppressive for him, he had several times looked in amazement at a small, iron stove in the corner that certainly could not have been lit, the heat of the room was inexplicable. As he took off his winter overcoat and also unbuttoned his frock coat the painter said to him in apology, ""I must have warmth. And it is very cosy here, isn't it. This room's very good in that respect."" K. made no reply, but it was actually not the heat that made him uncomfortable but, much more, the stuffiness, the air that almost made it more difficult to breathe, the room had probably not been ventilated for a long time. The unpleasantness of this was made all the stronger for K. when the painter invited him to sit on the bed while he himself sat down on the only chair in the room in front of the easel. The painter even seemed to misunderstand why K. remained at the edge of the bed and urged K. to make himself comfortable, and as he hesitated he went over to the bed himself and pressed K. deep down into the bedclothes and pillows. Then he went back to his seat and at last he asked his first objective question, which made K. forget everything else. ""You're innocent, are you?"" he asked. ""Yes,"" said K. He felt a simple joy at answering this question, especially as the answer was given to a private individual and therefore would have no consequences. Up till then no-one had asked him this question so openly. To make the most of his pleasure he added, ""I am totally innocent."" ""So,"" said the painter, and he lowered his head and seemed to be thinking. Suddenly he raised his head again and said, ""Well if you're innocent it's all very simple."" K. began to scowl, this supposed trustee of the court was talking like an ignorant child. ""My being innocent does not make things simple,"" said K. Despite everything, he couldn't help smiling and slowly shook his head. ""There are many fine details in which the court gets lost, but in the end it reaches into some place where originally there was nothing and pulls enormous guilt out of it."" ""Yeah, yeah, sure,"" said the painter, as if K. had been disturbing his train of thought for no reason. ""But you are innocent, aren't you?"" ""Well of course I am,"" said K. ""That's the main thing,"" said the painter. There was no counter-argument that could influence him, but although he had made up his mind it was not clear whether he was talking this way because of conviction or indifference. K., then, wanted to find out and said therefore, ""I'm sure you're more familiar with the court than I am, I know hardly more about it than what I've heard, and that's been from many very different people. But they were all agreed on one thing, and that was that when ill thought-out accusations are made they are not ignored, and that once the court has made an accusation it is convinced of the guilt of the defendant and it's very hard to make it think otherwise."" ""Very hard?"" the painter asked, throwing one hand up in the air. ""It's impossible to make it think otherwise. If I painted all the judges next to each other here on canvas, and you were trying to defend yourself in front of it, you'd have more success with them than you'd ever have with the real court."" ""Yes,"" said K. to himself, forgetting that he had only gone there to",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,69,"investigate the painter. One of the girls behind the door started up again, and asked, ""Titorelli, is he going to go soon?"" ""Quiet!"" shouted the painter at the door, ""Can't you see I'm talking with the gentleman?"" But this was not enough to satisfy the girl and she asked, ""You going to paint his picture?"" And when the painter didn't answer she added, ""Please don't paint him, he's an 'orrible bloke."" There followed an incomprehensible, interwoven babble of shouts and replies and calls of agreement. The painter leapt over to the door, opened it very slightly - the girls' clasped hands could be seen stretching through the crack as if they wanted something - and said, ""If you're not quiet I'll throw you all down the stairs. Sit down here on the steps and be quiet."" They probably did not obey him immediately, so that he had to command, ""Down on the steps!"" Only then it became quiet. ""I'm sorry about that,"" said the painter as he returned to K. K. had hardly turned towards the door, he had left it completely up to the painter whether and how he would place him under his protection if he wanted to. Even now, he made hardly any movement as the painter bent over him and, whispering into his ear in order not to be heard outside, said, ""These girls belong to the court as well."" ""How's that?"" asked K., as he leant his head to one side and looked at the painter. But the painter sat back down on his chair and, half in jest, half in explanation, ""Well, everything belongs to the court."" ""That is something I had never noticed until now,"" said K. curtly, this general comment of the painter's made his comment about the girls far less disturbing. Nonetheless, K. looked for a while at the door, behind which the girls were now sitting quietly on the steps. Except, that one of them had pushed a drinking straw through a crack between the planks and was moving it slowly up and down. ""You still don't seem to have much general idea of what the court's about"", said the painter, who had stretched his legs wide apart and was tapping loudly on the floor with the tip of his foot. ""But as you're innocent you won't need it anyway. I'll get you out of this by myself."" ""How do you intend to do that?"" asked K. ""You did say yourself not long ago that it's quite impossible to go to the court with reasons and proofs."" ""Only impossible for reasons and proofs you take to the court yourself "" said the painter, raising his forefinger as if K. had failed to notice a fine distinction. ""It goes differently if you try to do something behind the public court, that's to say in the consultation rooms, in the corridors or here, for instance, in my studio."" K. now began to find it far easier to believe what the painter was saying, or rather it was largely in agreement with what he had also been told by others. In fact it was even quite promising. If it really was so easy to influence the judges through personal contacts as the lawyer had said then the painter's contacts with these vain judges was especially important, and at the very least should not be undervalued. And the painter would fit in very well in the circle of assistants that K. was slowly gathering around himself. He had been noted at the bank for his talent in organising, here, where he was placed entirely on his own resources, would be a good opportunity to test that talent to its limits. The painter observed the effect his explanation had had on K. and then, with a certain unease, said, ""Does it not occur to you that the way I'm speaking is almost like a lawyer? It's the incessant contact with the gentlemen of the court has that influence on me. I gain a lot by it, of course, but I lose a lot, artistically speaking."" ""How did you first come into contact with the judges, then?"" asked K., he wanted first to gain the painter's trust before he took him into his service. ""That was very easy,"" said the painter, ""I inherited these contacts. My father was court painter before me. It's a position that's always inherited. The can't use new people for it, the rules governing how the various grades of officials are painted are so many and varied, and, above all, so secret that no-one outside of certain families even knows them. In the drawer there, for instance, I've got my father's notes, which I don't show to anyone. But you're only able to paint judges if you know what they say. Although,",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,70,"even if I lost them no-one could ever dispute my position because of all the rules I just carry round in my head. All the judges want to be painted like the old, great judges were, and I'm the only one who can do that."" ""You are to be envied,"" said K., thinking of his position at the bank. ""Your position is quite unassailable, then?"" ""Yes, quite unassailable,"" said the painter, and he raised his shoulders in pride. ""That's how I can even afford to help some poor man facing trial now and then."" ""And how do you do that?"" asked K., as if the painter had not just described him as a poor man. The painter did not let himself be distracted, but said, ""In your case, for instance, as you're totally innocent, this is what I'll do."" The repeated mention of K.'s innocence was becoming irksome to him. It sometimes seemed to him as if the painter was using these comments to make a favourable outcome to the trial a precondition for his help, which of course would make the help itself unnecessary. But despite these doubts K. forced himself not to interrupt the painter. He did not want to do without the painter's help, that was what he had decided, and this help did not seem in any way less questionable than that of the lawyer. K. valued the painter's help far more highly because it was offered in a way that was more harmless and open. The painter had pulled his seat closer to the bed and continued in a subdued voice: ""I forgot to ask you; what sort of acquittal is it you want? There are three possibilities; absolute acquittal, apparent acquittal and deferment. Absolute acquittal is the best, of course, only there's nothing I could do to get that sort of outcome. I don't think there's anyone at all who could do anything to get an absolute acquittal. Probably the only thing that could do that is if the accused is innocent. As you are innocent it could actually be possible and you could depend on your innocence alone. In that case you won't need me or any other kind of help."" At first, K. was astonished at this orderly explanation, but then, just as quietly as the painter, he said, ""I think you're contradicting yourself."" ""How's that?"" asked the painter patiently, leaning back with a smile. This smile made K. feel as if he were examining not the words of the painter but seeking out inconsistencies in the procedures of the court itself. Nonetheless, he continued unabashed and said, ""You remarked earlier that the court cannot be approached with reasoned proofs, you later restricted this to the open court, and now you go so far as to say that an innocent man needs no assistance in court. That entails a contradiction. Moreover, you said earlier that the judges can be influenced personally but now you insist that an absolute acquittal, as you call it, can never be attained through personal influence. That entails a second contradiction."" ""It's quite easy to clear up these contradictions,"" said the painter. ""We're talking about two different things here, there's what it says in the law and there's what I know from my own experience, you shouldn't get the two confused. I've never seen it in writing, but the law does, of course, say on the one hand that the innocent will be set free, but on the other hand it doesn't say that the judges can be influenced. But in my experience it's the other way round. I don't know of any absolute acquittals but I do know of many times when a judge has been influenced. It's possible, of course, that there was no innocence in any of the cases I know about. But is that likely? Not a single innocent defendant in so many cases? When I was a boy I used to listen closely to my father when he told us about court cases at home, and the judges that came to his studio talked about the court, in our circles nobody talks about anything else; I hardly ever got the chance to go to court myself but always made use of it when I could, I've listened to countless trials at important stages in their development, I've followed them closely as far as they could be followed, and I have to say that I've never seen a single acquittal."" ""So. Not a single acquittal,"" said K., as if talking to himself and his hopes. ""That confirms the impression I already have of the court. So there's no point in it from this side either. They could replace the whole court with a single hangman."" ""You shouldn't generalise,"" said the painter, dissatisfied, ""I've only",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,71,"been talking about my own experience."" ""Well that's enough,"" said K., ""or have you heard of any acquittals that happened earlier?"" ""They say there have been some acquittals earlier,"" the painter answered, ""but it's very hard to be sure about it. The courts don't make their final conclusions public, not even the judges are allowed to know about them, so that all we know about these earlier cases are just legends. But most of them did involve absolute acquittals, you can believe that, but they can't be proved. On the other hand, you shouldn't forget all about them either, I'm sure there is some truth to them, and they are very beautiful, I've painted a few pictures myself depicting these legends."" ""My assessment will not be altered by mere legends,"" said K. ""I don't suppose it's possible to cite these legends in court, is it?"" The painter laughed. ""No, you can't cite them in court,"" he said. ""Then there's no point in talking about them,"" said K., he wanted, for the time being, to accept anything the painter told him, even if he thought it unlikely or contradicted what he had been told by others. He did not now have the time to examine the truth of everything the painter said or even to disprove it, he would have achieved as much as he could if the painter would help him in any way even if his help would not be decisive. As a result, he said, ""So let's pay no more attention to absolute acquittal, but you mentioned two other possibilities."" ""Apparent acquittal and deferment. They're the only possibilities,"" said the painter. ""But before we talk about them, would you not like to take your coat off? You must be hot."" ""Yes,"" said K., who until then had paid attention to nothing but the painter's explanations, but now that he had had the heat pointed out to him his brow began to sweat heavily. ""It's almost unbearable."" The painter nodded as if he understood K.'s discomfort very well. ""Could we not open the window?"" asked K. ""No,"" said the painter. ""It's only a fixed pane of glass, it can't be opened."" K. now realised that all this time he had been hoping the painter would suddenly go over to the window and pull it open. He had prepared himself even for the fog that he would breathe in through his open mouth. The thought that here he was entirely cut off from the air made him feel dizzy. He tapped lightly on the bedspread beside him and, with a weak voice, said, ""That is very inconvenient and unhealthy."" ""Oh no,"" said the painter in defence of his window, ""as it can't be opened this room retains the heat better than if the window were double glazed, even though it's only a single pane. There's not much need to air the room as there's so much ventilation through the gaps in the wood, but when I do want to I can open one of my doors, or even both of them."" K. was slightly consoled by this explanation and looked around to see where the second door was. The painter saw him do so and said, ""It's behind you, I had to hide it behind the bed."" Only then was K. able to see the little door in the wall. ""It's really much too small for a studio here,"" said the painter, as if he wanted to anticipate an objection K. would make. ""I had to arrange things as well as I could. That's obviously a very bad place for the bed, in front of the door. For instance when the judge I'm painting at present comes he always comes through the door by the bed, and I've even given him a key to this door so that he can wait for me here in the studio when I'm not home. Although nowadays he usually comes early in the morning when I'm still asleep. And of course, it always wakes me up when I hear the door opened beside the bed, however fast asleep I am. If you could hear the way I curse him as he climbs over my bed in the morning you'd lose all respect for judges. I suppose I could take the key away from him but that'd only make things worse. It only takes a tiny effort to break any of the doors here off their hinges."" All the time the painter was speaking, K. was considering whether he should take off his coat, but he finally realised that, if he didn't do so, he would be quite unable to stay here any longer, so he took off his frock coat and lay it on his knee so that he could put it back on",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,72,"again as soon as the conversation was over. He had hardly done this when one of the girls called out, ""Now he's taken his coat off!"" and they could all be heard pressing around the gaps in the planks to see the spectacle for themselves. ""The girls think I'm going to paint your portrait,"" said the painter, ""and that's why you're taking your coat off."" ""I see,"" said K., only slightly amused by this, as he felt little better than he had before even though he now sat in his shirtsleeves. With some irritation he asked, ""What did you say the two other possibilities were?"" He had already forgotten the terms used. ""Apparent acquittal and deferment,"" said the painter. ""It's up to you which one you choose. You can get either of them if I help you, but it'll take some effort of course, the difference between them is that apparent acquittal needs concentrated effort for a while and that deferment takes much less effort but it has to be sustained. Now then, apparent acquittal. If that's what you want I'll write down an assertion of your innocence on a piece of paper. The text for an assertion of this sort was passed down to me from my father and it's quite unassailable. I take this assertion round to the judges I know. So I'll start off with the one I'm currently painting, and put the assertion to him when he comes for his sitting this evening. I'll lay the assertion in front of him, explain that you're innocent and give him my personal guarantee of it. And that's not just a superficial guarantee, it's a real one and it's binding."" The painter's eyes seemed to show some reproach of K. for wanting to impose that sort of responsibility on him. ""That would be very kind of you"", said K. ""And would the judge then believe you and nonetheless not pass an absolute acquittal?"" ""It's like I just said,"" answered the painter. ""And anyway, it's not entirely sure that all the judges would believe me, many of them, for instance, might want me to bring you to see them personally. So then you'd have to come along too. But at least then, if that happens, the matter is half way won, especially as I'd teach you in advance exactly how you'd need to act with the judge concerned, of course. What also happens, though, is that there are some judges who'll turn me down in advance, and that's worse. I'll certainly make several attempts, but still, we'll have to forget about them, but at least we can afford to do that as no one judge can pass the decisive verdict. Then when I've got enough judges' signatures on this document I take it to the judge who's concerned with your case. I might even have his signature already, in which case things develop a bit quicker than they would do otherwise. But there aren't usually many hold ups from then on, and that's the time that the defendant can feel most confident. It's odd, but true, that people feel more confidence in this time than they do after they've been acquitted. There's no particular exertion needed now. When he has the document asserting the defendant's innocence, guaranteed by a number of other judges, the judge can acquit you without any worries, and although there are still several formalities to be gone through there's no doubt that that's what he'll do as a favour to me and several other acquaintances. You, however, walk out the court and you're free."" ""So, then I'll be free,"" said K., hesitantly. ""That's right,"" said the painter, ""but only apparently free or, to put it a better way, temporarily free, as the most junior judges, the ones I know, they don't have the right to give the final acquittal. Only the highest judge can do that, in the court that's quite of reach for you, for me and for all of us. We don't know how things look there and, incidentally, we don't want to know. The right to acquit people is a major privilege and our judges don't have it, but they do have the right to free people from the indictment. That's to say, if they're freed in this way then for the time being the charge is withdrawn but it's still hanging over their heads and it only takes an order from higher up to bring it back into force. And as I'm in such good contact with the court I can also tell you how the difference between absolute and apparent acquittal is described, just in a superficial way, in the directives to the court offices. If there's an absolute acquittal all proceedings should stop, everything disappears from the process, not just",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,73,"the indictment but the trial and even the acquittal disappears, everything just disappears. With an apparent acquittal it's different. When that happens, nothing has changed except that the case for your innocence, for your acquittal and the grounds for the acquittal have been made stronger. Apart from that, proceedings go on as before, the court offices continue their business and the case gets passed to higher courts, gets passed back down to the lower courts and so on, backwards and forwards, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, to and fro. It's impossible to know exactly what's happening while this is going on. Seen from outside it can sometimes seem that everything has been long since forgotten, the documents have been lost and the acquittal is complete. No-one familiar with the court would believe it. No documents ever get lost, the court forgets nothing. One day - no-one expects it - some judge or other picks up the documents and looks more closely at them, he notices that this particular case is still active, and orders the defendant's immediate arrest. I've been talking here as if there's a long delay between apparent acquittal and re-arrest, that is quite possible and I do know of cases like that, but it's just as likely that the defendant goes home after he's been acquitted and finds somebody there waiting to re-arrest him. Then, of course, his life as a free man is at an end."" ""And does the trial start over again?"" asked K., finding it hard to believe. ""The trial will always start over again,"" said the painter, ""but there is, once again as before, the possibility of getting an apparent acquittal. Once again, the accused has to muster all his strength and mustn't give up."" The painter said that last phrase possibly as a result of the impression that K., whose shoulders had dropped somewhat, gave on him. ""But to get a second acquittal,"" asked K., as if in anticipation of further revelations by the painter, ""is that not harder to get than the first time?"" ""As far as that's concerned,"" answered the painter, ""there's nothing you can say for certain. You mean, do you, that the second arrest would have an adverse influence on the judge and the verdict he passes on the defendant? That's not how it happens. When the acquittal is passed the judges are already aware that re-arrest is likely. So when it happens it has hardly any effect. But there are countless other reasons why the judges' mood and their legal acumen in the case can be altered, and efforts to obtain the second acquittal must therefore be suited to the new conditions, and generally just as vigorous as the first."" ""But this second acquittal will once again not be final,"" said K., shaking his head. ""Of course not,"" said the painter, ""the second acquittal is followed by the third arrest, the third acquittal by the fourth arrest and so on. That's what is meant by the term apparent acquittal."" K. was silent. ""You clearly don't think an apparent acquittal offers much advantage,"" said the painter, ""perhaps deferment would suit you better. Would you like me to explain what deferment is about?"" K. nodded. The painter had leant back and spread himself out in his chair, his nightshirt was wide open, he had pushed his hand inside and was stroking his breast and his sides. ""Deferment,"" said the painter, looking vaguely in front of himself for a while as if trying to find a perfectly appropriate explanation, ""deferment consists of keeping proceedings permanently in their earliest stages. To do that, the accused and those helping him need to keep in continuous personal contact with the court, especially those helping him. I repeat, this doesn't require so much effort as getting an apparent acquittal, but it probably requires a lot more attention. You must never let the trial out of your sight, you have to go and see the appropriate judge at regular intervals as well as when something in particular comes up and, whatever you do, you have to try and remain friendly with him; if you don't know the judge personally you have to influence him through the judges you do know, and you have to do it without giving up on the direct discussions. As long as you don't fail to do any of these things you can be reasonably sure the trial won't get past its first stages. The trial doesn't stop, but the defendant is almost as certain of avoiding conviction as if he'd been acquitted. Compared with an apparent acquittal, deferment has the advantage that the defendant's future is less uncertain, he's safe from the shock of being suddenly re-arrested and doesn't need to fear the exertions and stress involved in getting an apparent",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,74,"acquittal just when everything else in his life would make it most difficult. Deferment does have certain disadvantages of its own though, too, and they shouldn't be under-estimated. I don't mean by this that the defendant is never free, he's never free in the proper sense of the word with an apparent acquittal either. There's another disadvantage. Proceedings can't be prevented from moving forward unless there are some at least ostensible reasons given. So something needs to seem to be happening when looked at from the outside. This means that from time to time various injunctions have to be obeyed, the accused has to be questioned, investigations have to take place and so on. The trial's been artificially constrained inside a tiny circle, and it has to be continuously spun round within it. And that, of course, brings with it certain unpleasantnesses for the accused, although you shouldn't imagine they're all that bad. All of this is just for show, the interrogations, for instance, they're only very short, if you ever don't have the time or don't feel like going to them you can offer an excuse, with some judges you can even arrange the injunctions together a long time in advance, in essence all it means is that, as the accused, you have to report to the judge from time to time."" Even while the painter was speaking those last words K. had laid his coat over his arm and had stood up. Immediately, from outside the door, there was a cry of 'He's standing up now!'. ""Are you leaving already?"" asked the painter, who had also stood up. ""It must be the air that's driving you out. I'm very sorry about that. There's still a lot I need to tell you. I had to put everything very briefly but I hope at least it was all clear."" ""Oh yes,"" said K., whose head was aching from the effort of listening. Despite this affirmation the painter summed it all up once more, as if he wanted to give K. something to console him on his way home. ""Both have in common that they prevent the defendant being convicted,"" he said. ""But they also prevent his being properly acquitted,"" said K. quietly, as if ashamed to acknowledge it. ""You've got it, in essence,"" said the painter quickly. K. placed his hand on his winter overcoat but could not bring himself to put it on. Most of all he would have liked to pack everything together and run out to the fresh air. Not even the girls could induce him to put his coat on, even though they were already loudly telling each other that he was doing so. The painter still had to interpret K.'s mood in some way, so he said, ""I expect you've deliberately avoided deciding between my suggestions yet. That's good. I would even have advised against making a decision straight away. There's no more than a hair's breadth of difference between the advantages and disadvantages. Everything has to be carefully weighed up. But the most important thing is you shouldn't lose too much time."" ""I'll come back here again soon,"" said K., who had suddenly decided to put his frock coat on, threw his overcoat over his shoulder and hurried over to the door behind which the girls now began to scream. K. thought he could even see the screaming girls through the door. ""Well, you'll have to keep your word,"" said the painter, who had not followed him, ""otherwise I'll to the bank to ask about it myself."" ""Will you open this door for me,"" said K. pulling at the handle which, as he noticed from the resistance, was being held tightly by the girls on the other side. ""Do you want to be bothered by the girls?"" asked the painter. ""It's better if you use the other way out,"" he said, pointing to the door behind the bed. K. agreed to this and jumped back to the bed. But instead of opening that door the painter crawled under the bed and from underneath it asked K., ""Just a moment more, would you not like to see a picture I could sell to you?"" K. did not want to be impolite, the painter really had taken his side and promised to help him more in the future, and because of K.'s forgetfulness there had been no mention of any payment for the painter's help, so K. could not turn him down now and allowed him to show him the picture, even though he was quivering with impatience to get out of the studio. From under the bed, the painter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings. They were so covered in dust that when the painter tried to blow it off the one on top the",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,75,"dust swirled around in front of K.'s eyes, robbing him of breath for some time. ""Moorland landscape,"" said the painter passing the picture to K. It showed two sickly trees, well separated from each other in dark grass. In the background there was a multi-coloured sunset. ""That's nice,"" said K. ""I'll buy it."" K. expressed himself in this curt way without any thought, so he was glad when the painter did not take this amiss and picked up a second painting from the floor. ""This is a counterpart to the first picture,"" said the painter. Perhaps it had been intended as a counterpart, but there was not the slightest difference to be seen between it and the first picture, there were the trees, there the grass and there the sunset. But this was of little importance to K. ""They are beautiful landscapes,"" he said, ""I'll buy them both and hang them in my office."" ""You seem to like this subject,"" said the painter, picking up a third painting, ""good job I've still got another, similar picture here."" The picture though, was not similar, rather it was exactly the same moorland landscape. The painter was fully exploiting this opportunity to sell off his old pictures. ""I'll take this one too,"" said K. ""How much do the three paintings cost?"" ""We can talk about that next time,"" said the painter. ""You're in a hurry now, and we'll still be in contact. And besides, I'm glad you like the paintings, I'll give you all the paintings I've got down here. They're all moorland landscapes, I've painted a lot of moorland landscapes. A lot of people don't like that sort of picture because they're too gloomy, but there are others, and you're one of them, who love gloomy themes."" But K. was not in the mood to hear about the professional experiences of this painter cum beggar. ""Wrap them all up!"" he called out, interrupting the painter as he was speaking, ""my servant will come to fetch them in the morning."" ""There's no need for that,"" said the painter. ""I expect I can find a porter for you who can go with you now."" And, at last, he leant over the bed and unlocked the door. ""Just step on the bed, don't worry about that,"" said the painter, ""that's what everyone does who comes in here."" Even without this invitation, K. had shown no compunction in already placing his foot in the middle of the bed covers, then he looked out through the open door and drew his foot back again. ""What is that?"" he asked the painter. ""What are you so surprised at?"" he asked, surprised in his turn. ""Those are court offices. Didn't you know there are court offices here? There are court offices in almost every attic, why should this building be any different? Even my studio is actually one of the court offices but the court put it at my disposal."" It was not so much finding court offices even here that shocked K., he was mainly shocked at himself, at his own navety in court matters. It seemed to him that one of the most basic rules governing how a defendant should behave was always to be prepared, never allow surprises, never to look, unsuspecting, to the right when the judge stood beside him to his left - and this was the very basic rule that he was continually violating. A long corridor extended in from of him, air blew in from it which, compared with the air in the studio, was refreshing. There were benches set along each side of the corridor just as in the waiting area for the office he went to himself. There seemed to be precise rules governing how offices should be equipped. There did not seem to be many people visiting the offices that day. There was a man there, half sitting, half laying, his face was buried in his arm on the bench and he seemed to be sleeping; another man was standing in the half-dark at the end of the corridor. K. now climbed over the bed, the painter followed him with the pictures. They soon came across a servant of the court - K. was now able to recognise all the servants of the court from the gold buttons they wore on their civilian clothes below the normal buttons - and the painter instructed him to go with K. carrying the pictures. K. staggered more than he walked, his handkerchief pressed over his mouth. They had nearly reached the exit when the girls stormed in on them, so K. had not been able to avoid them. They had clearly seen that the second door of the studio had been opened and had gone around to impose themselves on him from",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,76,"this side. ""I can't come with you any further!"" called out the painter with a laugh as the girls pressed in. ""Goodbye, and don't hesitate too long!"" K. did not even look round at him. Once on the street he took the first cab he came across. He now had to get rid of the servant, whose gold button continually caught his eye even if it caught no-one else's. As a servant, the servant of the court was going to sit on the coach-box. But K. chased him down from there. It was already well into the afternoon when K. arrived in front of the bank. He would have liked to leave the pictures in the cab but feared there might be some occasion when he would have to let the painter see he still had them. So he had the pictures taken to his office and locked them in the lowest drawer of his desk so that he could at least keep them safe from the deputy director's view for the next few days. Chapter Eight Block, the businessman - Dismissing the lawyer K. had at last made the decision to withdraw his defence from the lawyer. It was impossible to remove his doubts as to whether this was the right decision, but this was outweighed by his belief in its necessity. This decision, on the day he intended to go to see the lawyer, took a lot of the strength he needed for his work, he worked exceptionally slowly, he had to remain in his office a long time, and it was already past ten o'clock when he finally stood in front of the lawyer's front door. Even before he rang he considered whether it might not be better to give the lawyer notice by letter or telephone, a personal conversation would certainly be very difficult. Nonetheless, K. did not actually want to do without it, if he gave notice by any other means it would be received in silence or with a few formulated words, and unless Leni could discover anything K. would never learn how the lawyer had taken his dismissal and what its consequences might be, in the lawyer's not unimportant opinion. But sitting in front of him and taken by surprise by his dismissal, K. would be able easily to infer everything he wanted from the lawyer's face and behaviour, even if he could not be induced to say very much. It was not even out of the question that K. might, after all, be persuaded that it would be best to leave his defence to the lawyer and withdraw his dismissal. As usual, there was at first no response to K.'s ring at the door. ""Leni could be a bit quicker,"" thought K. But he could at least be glad there was nobody else interfering as usually happened, be it the man in his nightshirt or anyone else who might bother him. As K. pressed on the button for the second time he looked back at the other door, but this time it, too, remained closed. At last, two eyes appeared at the spy-hatch in the lawyer's door, although they weren't Leni's eyes. Someone unlocked the door, but kept himself pressed against it as he called back inside, ""It's him!"", and only then did he open the door properly. K. pushed against the door, as behind him he could already hear the key being hurriedly turned in the lock of the door to the other flat. When the door in front of him finally opened, he stormed straight into the hallway. Through the corridor which led between the rooms he saw Leni, to whom the warning cry of the door opener had been directed, still running away in her nightshirt . He looked at her for a moment and then looked round at the person who had opened the door. It was a small, wizened man with a full beard, he held a candle in his hand. ""Do you work here?"" asked K. ""No,"" answered the man, ""I don't belong here at all, the lawyer is only representing me, I'm here on legal business."" ""Without your coat?"" asked K., indicating the man's deficiency of dress with a gesture of his hand. ""Oh, do forgive me!"" said the man, and he looked at himself in the light of the candle he was holding as if he had not known about his appearance until then. ""Is Leni your lover?"" asked K. curtly. He had set his legs slightly apart, his hands, in which he held his hat, were behind his back. Merely by being in possession of a thick overcoat he felt his advantage over this thin little man. ""Oh God,"" he said and, shocked, raised one hand in front of his face as if",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,77,"in defence, ""no, no, what can you be thinking?"" ""You look honest enough,"" said K. with a smile, ""but come along anyway."" K. indicated with his hat which way the man was to go and let him go ahead of him. ""What is you name then?"" asked K. on the way. ""Block. I'm a businessman,"" said the small man, twisting himself round as he thus introduced himself, although K. did not allow him to stop moving. ""Is that your real name?"" asked K. ""Of course it is,"" was the man's reply, ""why do you doubt it?"" ""I thought you might have some reason to keep your name secret,"" said K. He felt himself as much at liberty as is normally only felt in foreign parts when speaking with people of lower standing, keeping everything about himself to himself, speaking only casually about the interests of the other, able to raise him to a level above one's own, but also able, at will, to let him drop again. K. stopped at the door of the lawyer's office, opened it and, to the businessman who had obediently gone ahead, called, ""Not so fast! Bring some light here!"" K. thought Leni might have hidden in here, he let the businessman search in every corner, but the room was empty. In front of the picture of the judge K. took hold of the businessman's braces to stop him moving on. ""Do you know him?"" he asked, pointing upwards with his finger. The businessman lifted the candle, blinked as he looked up and said, ""It's a judge."" ""An important judge?"" asked K., and stood to the side and in front of the businessman so that he could observe what impression the picture had on him. The businessman was looking up in admiration. ""He's an important judge."" ""You don't have much insight,"" said K. ""He is the lowest of the lowest examining judges."" ""I remember now,"" said the businessman as he lowered the candle, ""that's what I've already been told."" ""Well of course you have,"" called out K., ""I'd forgotten about it, of course you would already have been told."" ""But why, why?"" asked the businessman as he moved forwards towards the door, propelled by the hands of K. Outside in the corridor K. said, ""You know where Leni's hidden, do you?"" ""Hidden?"" said the businessman, ""No, but she might be in the kitchen cooking soup for the lawyer."" ""Why didn't you say that immediately?"" asked K. ""I was going to take you there, but you called me back again,"" answered the businessman, as if confused by the contradictory commands. ""You think you're very clever, don't you,"" said K, ""now take me there!"" K. had never been in the kitchen, it was surprisingly big and very well equipped. The stove alone was three times bigger than normal stoves, but it was not possible to see any detail beyond this as the kitchen was at the time illuminated by no more than a small lamp hanging by the entrance. At the stove stood Leni, in a white apron as always, breaking eggs into a pot standing on a spirit lamp. ""Good evening, Josef,"" she said with a glance sideways. ""Good evening,"" said K., pointing with one hand to a chair in a corner which the businessman was to sit on, and he did indeed sit down on it. K. however went very close behind Leni's back, leant over her shoulder and asked, ""Who is this man?"" Leni put one hand around K. as she stirred the soup with the other, she drew him forward toward herself and said, ""He's a pitiful character, a poor businessman by the name of Block. Just look at him."" The two of them looked back over their shoulders. The businessman was sitting on the chair that K. had directed him to, he had extinguished the candle whose light was no longer needed and pressed on the wick with his fingers to stop the smoke. ""You were in your nightshirt,"" said K., putting his hand on her head and turning it back towards the stove. She was silent. ""Is he your lover?"" asked K. She was about to take hold of the pot of soup, but K. took both her hands and said, ""Answer me!"" She said, ""Come into the office, I'll explain everything to you."" ""No,"" said K., ""I want you to explain it here."" She put her arms around him and wanted to kiss him. K., though, pushed her away and said, ""I don't want you to kiss me now."" ""Josef,"" said Leni, looking at K. imploringly but frankly in the eyes, ""you're not going to be jealous of Mr. Block now, are you? Rudi,"" she then said, turning to the businessman, ""help me out will you, I'm being suspected of",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,78,"something, you can see that, leave the candle alone."" It had looked as though Mr. Block had not been paying attention but he had been following closely. ""I don't even know why you might be jealous,"" he said ingenuously. ""Nor do I, actually,"" said K., looking at the businessman with a smile. Leni laughed out loud and while K. was not paying attention took the opportunity of embracing him and whispering, ""Leave him alone, now, you can see what sort of person he is. I've been helping him a little bit because he's an important client of the lawyer's, and no other reason. And what about you? Do you want to speak to the lawyer at this time of day? He's very unwell today, but if you want I'll tell him you're here. But you can certainly spend the night with me. It's so long since you were last here, even the lawyer has been asking about you. Don't neglect your case! And I've got some things to tell you that I've learned about. But now, before anything else, take your coat off!"" She helped him off with his coat, took the hat off his head, ran with the things into the hallway to hang them up, then she ran back and saw to the soup. ""Do you want me to tell him you're here straight away or take him his soup first?"" ""Tell him I'm here first,"" said K. He was in a bad mood, he had originally intended a detailed discussion of his business with Leni, especially the question of his giving the lawyer notice, but now he no longer wanted to because of the presence of the businessman. Now he considered his affair too important to let this little businessman take part in it and perhaps change some of his decisions, and so he called Leni back even though she was already on her way to the lawyer. ""Bring him his soup first,"" he said, ""I want him to get his strength up for the discussion with me, he'll need it."" ""You're a client of the lawyer's too, aren't you,"" said the businessman quietly from his corner as if he were trying to find this out. It was not, however, taken well. ""What business is that of yours?"" said K., and Leni said, ""Will you be quiet. - I'll take him his soup first then, shall I?"" And she poured the soup into a dish. ""The only worry then is that he might go to sleep soon after he's eaten."" ""What I've got to say to him will keep him awake,"" said K., who still wanted to intimate that he intended some important negotiations with the lawyer, he wanted Leni to ask him what it was and only then to ask her advice. But instead, she just promptly carried out the order he had given her. When she went over to him with the dish she deliberately brushed against him and whispered, ""I'll tell him you're here as soon as he's eaten the soup so that I can get you back as soon as possible."" ""Just go,"" said K., ""just go."" ""Be a bit more friendly,"" she said and, still holding the dish, turned completely round once more in the doorway. K. watched her as she went; the decision had finally been made that the lawyer was to be dismissed, it was probably better that he had not been able to discuss the matter any more with Leni beforehand; she hardly understood the complexity of the matter, she would certainly have advised him against it and perhaps would even have prevented him from dismissing the lawyer this time, he would have remained in doubt and unease and eventually have carried out his decision after a while anyway as this decision was something he could not avoid. The sooner it was carried out the more harm would be avoided. And moreover, perhaps the businessman had something to say on the matter. K. turned round, the businessman hardly noticed it as he was about to stand up. ""Stay where you are,"" said K. and pulled up a chair beside him. ""Have you been a client of the lawyer's for a long time?"" asked K. ""Yes,"" said the businessman, ""a very long time."" ""How many years has he been representing you so far, then?"" asked K. ""I don't know how you mean,"" said the businessman, ""he's been my business lawyer - I buy and sell cereals - he's been my business lawyer since I took the business over, and that's about twenty years now, but perhaps you mean my own trial and he's been representing me in that since it started, and that's been more than five years. Yes, well over five years,"" he then added, pulling out an old",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,79,"briefcase, ""I've got everything written down; I can tell you the exact dates if you like. It's so hard to remember everything. Probably, my trial's been going on much longer than that, it started soon after the death of my wife, and that's been more than five and a half years now."" K. moved in closer to him. ""So the lawyer takes on ordinary legal business, does he?"" he asked. This combination of criminal and commercial business seemed surprisingly reassuring for K. ""Oh yes,"" said the businessman, and then he whispered, ""They even say he's more efficient in jurisprudence than he is in other matters."" But then he seemed to regret saying this, and he laid a hand on K.'s shoulder and said, ""Please don't betray me to him, will you."" K. patted his thigh to reassure him and said, ""No, I don't betray people."" ""He can be so vindictive, you see,"" said the businessman. ""I'm sure he won't do anything against such a faithful client as you,"" said K. ""Oh, he might do,"" said the businessman, ""when he gets cross it doesn't matter who it is, and anyway, I'm not really faithful to him."" ""How's that then?"" asked K. ""I'm not sure I should tell you about it,"" said the businessman hesitantly. ""I think it'll be alright,"" said K. ""Well then,"" said the businessman, ""I'll tell you about some of it, but you'll have to tell me a secret too, then we can support each other with the lawyer."" ""You are very careful,"" said K., ""but I'll tell you a secret that will set your mind completely at ease. Now tell me, in what way have you been unfaithful to the lawyer?"" ""I've ..."" said the businessman hesitantly, and in a tone as if he were confessing something dishonourable, ""I've taken on other lawyers besides him."" ""That's not so serious,"" said K., a little disappointed. ""It is, here,"" said the businessman, who had had some difficulty breathing since making his confession but who now, after hearing K.'s comment, began to feel more trust for him. ""That's not allowed. And it's allowed least of all to take on petty lawyers when you've already got a proper one. And that's just what I have done, besides him I've got five petty lawyers."" ""Five!"" exclaimed K., astonished at this number, ""Five lawyers besides this one?"" The businessman nodded. ""I'm even negotiating with a sixth one."" ""But why do you need so many lawyers?"" asked K. ""I need all of them,"" said the businessman. ""Would you mind explaining that to me?"" asked K. ""I'd be glad to,"" said the businessman. ""Most of all, I don't want to lose my case, well that's obvious. So that means I mustn't neglect anything that might be of use to me; even if there's very little hope of a particular thing being of any use I can't just throw it away. So everything I have I've put to use in my case. I've taken all the money out of my business, for example, the offices for my business used to occupy nearly a whole floor, but now all I need is a little room at the back where I work with one apprentice. It wasn't just using up the money that caused the difficulty, of course, it was much more to do with me not working at the business as much as I used to. If you want to do something about your trial you don't have much time for anything else."" ""So you're also working at the court yourself?"" asked K. ""That's just what I want to learn more about."" ""I can't tell you very much about that,"" said the businessman, ""at first I tried to do that too but I soon had to give it up again. It wears you out too much, and it's really not much use. And it turned out to be quite impossible to work there yourself and to negotiate, at least for me it was. It's a heavy strain there just sitting and waiting. You know yourself what the air is like in those offices."" ""How do you know I've been there, then?"" asked K. ""I was in the waiting room myself when you went through."" ""What a coincidence that is!"" exclaimed K., totally engrossed and forgetting how ridiculous the businessman had seemed to him earlier. ""So you saw me! You were in the waiting room when I went through. Yes, I did go through it one time."" ""It isn't such a big coincidence,"" said the businessman, ""I'm there nearly every day."" ""I expect I'll have to go there quite often myself now,"" said K., ""although I can hardly expect to be shown the same respect as I was then. They all stood up for me. They must have thought",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,80,"I was a judge."" ""No,"" said the businessman, ""we were greeting the servant of the court. We knew you were a defendant. That sort of news spreads very quickly."" ""So you already knew about that,"" said K., ""the way I behaved must have seemed very arrogant to you. Did you criticise me for it afterwards?"" ""No,"" said the businessman, ""quite the opposite. That was just stupidity."" ""What do you mean, 'stupidity'?"" asked K. ""Why are you asking about it?"" said the businessman in some irritation. ""You still don't seem to know the people there and you might take it wrong. Don't forget in proceedings like this there are always lots of different things coming up to talk about, things that you just can't understand with reason alone, you just get too tired and distracted for most things and so, instead, people rely on superstition. I'm talking about the others, but I'm no better myself. One of these superstitions, for example, is that you can learn a lot about the outcome of a defendant's case by looking at his face, especially the shape of his lips. There are lots who believe that, and they said they could see from the shape of your lips that you'd definitely be found guilty very soon. I repeat that all this is just a ridiculous superstition, and in most cases it's completely disproved by the facts, but when you live in that society it's hard to hold yourself back from beliefs like that. Just think how much effect that superstition can have. You spoke to one of them there, didn't you? He was hardly able to give you an answer. There are lots of things there that can make you confused, of course, but one of them, for him, was the appearance of your lips. He told us all later he thought he could see something in your lips that meant he'd be convicted himself."" ""On my lips?"" asked K., pulling out a pocket mirror and examining himself. ""I can see nothing special about my lips. Can you?"" ""Nor can I,"" said the businessman, ""nothing at all."" ""These people are so superstitious!"" exclaimed K. ""Isn't that what I just told you?"" asked the businessman. ""Do you then have that much contact with each other, exchanging each other's opinions?"" said K. ""I've kept myself completely apart so far."" ""They don't normally have much contact with each other,"" said the businessman, ""that would be impossible, there are so many of them. And they don't have much in common either. If a group of them ever thinks they have found something in common it soon turns out they were mistaken. There's nothing you can do as a group where the court's concerned. Each case is examined separately, the court is very painstaking. So there's nothing to be achieved by forming into a group, only sometimes an individual will achieve something in secret; and it's only when that's been done the others learn about it; nobody knows how it was done. So there's no sense of togetherness, you meet people now and then in the waiting rooms, but we don't talk much there. The superstitious beliefs were established a long time ago and they spread all by themselves."" ""I saw those gentlemen in the waiting room,"" said K., ""it seemed so pointless for them to be waiting in that way."" ""Waiting is not pointless,"" said the businessman, ""it's only pointless if you try and interfere yourself. I told you just now I've got five lawyers besides this one. You might think - I thought it myself at first - you might think I could leave the whole thing entirely up to them now. That would be entirely wrong. I can leave it up to them less than when I had just the one. Maybe you don't understand that, do you?"" ""No,"" said K., and to slow the businessman down, who had been speaking too fast, he laid his hand on the businessman's to reassure him, ""but I'd like just to ask you to speak a little more slowly, these are many very important things for me, and I can't follow exactly what you're saying."" ""You're quite right to remind me of that,"" said the businessman, ""you're new to all this, a junior. Your trial is six months old, isn't it? Yes, I've heard about it. Such a new case! But I've already thought all these things through countless times, to me they're the most obvious things in the world."" ""You must be glad your trial has already progressed so far, are you?"" asked K., he did not wish to ask directly how the businessman's affairs stood, but received no clear answer anyway. ""Yes, I've been working at my trial for five years now,"" said the businessman as his head",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,81,"sank, ""that's no small achievement."" Then he was silent for a while. K. listened to hear whether Leni was on her way back. On the one hand he did not want her to come back too soon as he still had many questions to ask and did not want her to find him in this intimate discussion with the businessman, but on the other hand it irritated him that she stayed so long with the lawyer when K. was there, much longer than she needed to give him his soup. ""I still remember it exactly,"" the businessman began again, and K. immediately gave him his full attention, ""when my case was as old as yours is now. I only had this one lawyer at that time but I wasn't very satisfied with him."" Now I'll find out everything, thought K., nodding vigorously as if he could thereby encourage the businessman to say everything worth knowing. ""My case,"" the businessman continued, ""didn't move on at all, there were some hearings that took place and I went to every one of them, collected materials, handed all my business books to the court - which I later found was entirely unnecessary - I ran back and forth to the lawyer, and he submitted various documents to the court too ..."" ""Various documents?"" asked K. ""Yes, that's right,"" said the businessman. ""That's very important for me,"" said K., ""in my case he's still working on the first set of documents. He still hasn't done anything. I see now that he's been neglecting me quite disgracefully."" ""There can be lots of good reasons why the first documents still aren't ready,"" said the businessman, ""and anyway, it turned out later on that the ones he submitted for me were entirely worthless. I even read one of them myself, one of the officials at the court was very helpful. It was very learned, but it didn't actually say anything. Most of all, there was lots of Latin, which I can't understand, then pages and pages of general appeals to the court, then lots of flattery for particular officials, they weren't named, these officials, but anyone familiar with the court must have been able to guess who they were, then there was self-praise by the lawyer where he humiliated himself to the court in a way that was downright dog- like, and then endless investigations of cases from the past which were supposed to be similar to mine. Although, as far as I was able to follow them, these investigations had been carried out very carefully. Now, I don't mean to criticise the lawyer's work with all of this, and the document I read was only one of many, but even so, and this is something I will say, at that time I couldn't see any progress in my trial at all."" ""And what sort of progress had you been hoping for?"" asked K. ""That's a very sensible question,"" said the businessman with a smile, ""it's only very rare that you see any progress in these proceedings at all. But I didn't know that then. I'm a businessman, much more in those days than now, I wanted to see some tangible progress, it should have all been moving to some conclusion or at least should have been moving on in some way according to the rules. Instead of which there were just more hearings, and most of them went through the same things anyway; I had all the answers off pat like in a church service; there were messengers from the court coming to me at work several times a week, or they came to me at home or anywhere else they could find me; and that was very disturbing of course (but at least now things are better in that respect, it's much less disturbing when they contact you by telephone), and rumours about my trial even started to spread among some of the people I do business with, and especially my relations, so I was being made to suffer in many different ways but there was still not the slightest sign that even the first hearing would take place soon. So I went to the lawyer and complained about it. He explained it all to me at length, but refused to do anything I asked for, no-one has any influence on the way the trial proceeds, he said, to try and insist on it in any of the documents submitted - like I was asking - was simply unheard of and would do harm to both him and me. I thought to myself: What this lawyer can't or won't do another lawyer will. So I looked round for other lawyers. And before you say anything: none of them asked for a definite date for the main",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,82,"trial and none of them got one, and anyway, apart form one exception which I'll talk about in a minute, it really is impossible, that's one thing this lawyer didn't mislead me about; but besides, I had no reason to regret turning to other lawyers. Perhaps you've already heard how Dr. Huld talks about the petty lawyers, he probably made them sound very contemptible to you, and he's right, they are contemptible. But when he talks about them and compares them with himself and his colleagues there's a small error running through what he says, and, just for your interest, I'll tell you about it. When he talks about the lawyers he mixes with he sets them apart by calling them the 'great lawyers'. That's wrong, anyone can call himself 'great' if he wants to, of course, but in this case only the usage of the court can make that distinction. You see, the court says that besides the petty lawyers there are also minor lawyers and great lawyers. This one and his colleagues are only minor lawyers, and the difference in rank between them and the great lawyers, who I've only ever heard about and never seen, is incomparably greater than between the minor lawyers and the despised petty lawyers."" ""The great lawyers?"" asked K. ""Who are they then? How do you contact them?"" ""You've never heard about them, then?"" said the businessman. ""There's hardly anyone who's been accused who doesn't spend a lot of time dreaming about the great lawyers once he's heard about them. It's best if you don't let yourself be misled in that way. I don't know who the great lawyers are, and there's probably no way of contacting them. I don't know of any case I can talk about with certainty where they've taken any part. They do defend a lot of people, but you can't get hold of them by your own efforts, they only defend those who they want to defend. And I don't suppose they ever take on cases that haven't already got past the lower courts. Anyway, it's best not to think about them, as if you do it makes the discussions with the other lawyers, all their advice and all that they do manage to achieve, seem so unpleasant and useless, I had that experience myself, just wanted to throw everything away and lay at home in bed and hear nothing more about it. But that, of course, would be the stupidest thing you could do, and you wouldn't be left in peace in bed for very long either."" ""So you weren't thinking about the great lawyers at that time?"" asked K. ""Not for very long,"" said the businessman, and smiled again, ""you can't forget about them entirely, I'm afraid, especially in the night when these thoughts come so easily. But I wanted immediate results in those days, so I went to the petty lawyers."" ""Well look at you two sat huddled together!"" called Leni as she came back with the dish and stood in the doorway. They were indeed sat close together, if either of them turned his head even slightly it would have knocked against the other's, the businessman was not only very small but also sat hunched down, so that K. was also forced to bend down low if he wanted to hear everything. ""Not quite yet!"" called out K., to turn Leni away, his hand, still resting on the businessman's hand, twitching with impatience. ""He wanted me to tell him about my trial,"" said the businessman to Leni. ""Carry on, then, carry on,"" she said. She spoke to the businessman with affection but, at the same time, with condescension. K. did not like that, he had begun to learn that the man was of some value after all, he had experience at least, and he was willing to share it. Leni was probably wrong about him. He watched her in irritation as Leni now took the candle from the businessman's hand - which he had been holding on to all this time - wiped his hand with her apron and then knelt beside him to scratch off some wax that had dripped from the candle onto his trousers. ""You were about to tell me about the petty lawyers,"" said K., shoving Leni's hand away with no further comment. ""What's wrong with you today?"" asked Leni, tapped him gently and carried on with what she had been doing. ""Yes, the petty lawyers,"" said the businessman, putting his hand to his brow as if thinking hard. K. wanted to help him and said, ""You wanted immediate results and so went to the petty lawyers."" ""Yes, that's right,"" said the businessman, but did not continue with what he'd been saying. ""Maybe he doesn't want to speak about it",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,83,"in front of Leni,"" thought K., suppressing his impatience to hear the rest straight away, and stopped trying to press him. ""Have you told him I'm here?"" he asked Leni. ""Course I have,"" she said, ""he's waiting for you. Leave Block alone now, you can talk to Block later, he'll still be here."" K. still hesitated. ""You'll still be here?"" he asked the businessman, wanting to hear the answer from him and not wanting Leni to speak about the businessman as if he weren't there, he was full of secret resentment towards Leni today. And once more it was only Leni who answered. ""He often sleeps here."" ""He sleeps here?"" exclaimed K., he had thought the businessman would just wait there for him while he quickly settled his business with the lawyer, and then they would leave together to discuss everything thoroughly and undisturbed. ""Yes,"" said Leni, ""not everyone's like you, Josef, allowed to see the lawyer at any time you like. Do don't even seem surprised that the lawyer, despite being ill, still receives you at eleven o'clock at night. You take it far too much for granted, what your friends do for you. Well, your friends, or at least I do, we like to do things for you. I don't want or need any more thanks than that you're fond of me."" ""Fond of you?"" thought K. at first, and only then it occurred to him, ""Well, yes, I am fond of her."" Nonetheless, what he said, forgetting all the rest, was, ""He receives me because I am his client. If I needed anyone else's help I'd have to beg and show gratitude whenever I do anything."" ""He's really nasty today, isn't he?"" Leni asked the businessman. ""Now it's me who's not here,"" thought K., and nearly lost his temper with the businessman when, with the same rudeness as Leni, he said, ""The lawyer also has other reasons to receive him. His case is much more interesting than mine. And it's only in its early stages too, it probably hasn't progressed very far so the lawyer still likes to deal with him. That'll all change later on."" ""Yeah, yeah,"" said Leni, looking at the businessman and laughing. ""He doesn't half talk!"" she said, turning to face K. ""You can't believe a word he says. He's as talkative as he is sweet. Maybe that's why the lawyer can't stand him. At least, he only sees him when he's in the right mood. I've already tried hard to change that but it's impossible. Just think, there are times when I tell him Block's here and he doesn't receive him until three days later. And if Block isn't on the spot when he's called then everything's lost and it all has to start all over again. That's why I let Block sleep here, it wouldn't be the first time Dr. Huld has wanted to see him in the night. So now Block is ready for that. Sometimes, when he knows Block is still here, he'll even change his mind about letting him in to see him."" K. looked questioningly at the businessman. The latter nodded and, although he had spoken quite openly with K. earlier, seemed to be confused with shame as he said, ""Yes, later on you become very dependent on your lawyer."" ""He's only pretending to mind,"" said Leni. ""He likes to sleep here really, he's often said so."" She went over to a little door and shoved it open. ""Do you want to see his bedroom?"" she asked. K. went over to the low, windowless room and looked in from the doorway. The room contained a narrow bed which filled it completely, so that to get into the bed you would need to climb over the bedpost. At the head of the bed there was a niche in the wall where, fastidiously tidy, stood a candle, a bottle of ink, and a pen with a bundle of papers which were probably to do with the trial. ""You sleep in the maid's room?"" asked K., as he went back to the businessman. ""Leni's let me have it,"" answered the businessman, ""it has many advantages."" K. looked long at him; his first impression of the businessman had perhaps not been right; he had experience as his trial had already lasted a long time, but he had paid a heavy price for this experience. K. was suddenly unable to bear the sight of the businessman any longer. ""Bring him to bed, then!"" he called out to Leni, who seemed to understand him. For himself, he wanted to go to the lawyer and, by dismissing him, free himself from not only the lawyer but also from Leni and the businessman. But before he had reached the door the businessman spoke to him",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,84,"gently. ""Excuse me, sir,"" he said, and K. looked round crossly. ""You've forgotten your promise,"" said the businessman, stretching his hand out to K. imploringly from where he sat. ""You were going to tell me a secret."" ""That is true,"" said K., as he glanced at Leni, who was watching him carefully, to check on her. ""So listen; it's hardly a secret now anyway. I'm going to see the lawyer now to sack him."" ""He's sacking him!"" yelled the businessman, and he jumped up from his chair and ran around the kitchen with his arms in the air. He kept on shouting, ""He's sacking his lawyer!"" Leni tried to rush at K. but the businessman got in her way so that she shoved him away with her fists. Then, still with her hands balled into fists, she ran after K. who, however, had been given a long start. He was already inside the lawyer's room by the time Leni caught up with him. He had almost closed the door behind himself, but Leni held the door open with her foot, grabbed his arm and tried to pull him back. But he put such pressure on her wrist that, with a sigh, she was forced to release him. She did not dare go into the room straight away, and K. locked the door with the key. ""I've been waiting for you a very long time,"" said the lawyer from his bed. He had been reading something by the light of a candle but now he laid it onto the bedside table and put his glasses on, looking at K. sharply through them. Instead of apologising K. said, ""I'll be leaving again soon."" As he had not apologised the lawyer ignored what K. said, and replied, ""I won't let you in this late again next time."" ""I find that quite acceptable,"" said K. The lawyer looked at him quizzically. ""Sit down,"" he said. ""As you wish,"" said K., drawing a chair up to the bedside table and sitting down. ""It seemed to me that you locked the door,"" said the lawyer. ""Yes,"" said K., ""it was because of Leni."" He had no intention of letting anyone off lightly. But the lawyer asked him, ""Was she being importunate again?"" ""Importunate?"" asked K. ""Yes,"" said the lawyer, laughing as he did so, had a fit of coughing and then, once it had passed, began to laugh again. ""I'm sure you must have noticed how importunate she can be sometimes,"" he said, and patted K.'s hand which K. had rested on the bedside table and which he now snatched back. ""You don't attach much importance to it, then,"" said the lawyer when K. was silent, ""so much the better. Otherwise I might have needed to apologise to you. It is a peculiarity of Leni's. I've long since forgiven her for it, and I wouldn't be talking of it now, if you hadn't locked the door just now. Anyway, perhaps I should at least explain this peculiarity of hers to you, but you seem rather disturbed, the way you're looking at me, and so that's why I'll do it, this peculiarity of hers consists in this; Leni finds most of the accused attractive. She attaches herself to each of them, loves each of them, even seems to be loved by each of them; then she sometimes entertains me by telling me about them when I allow her to. I am not so astonished by all of this as you seem to be. If you look at them in the right way the accused really can be attractive, quite often. But that is a remarkable and to some extent scientific phenomenon. Being indicted does not cause any clear, precisely definable change in a person's appearance, of course. But it's not like with other legal matters, most of them remain in their usual way of life and, if they have a good lawyer looking after them, the trial doesn't get in their way. But there are nonetheless those who have experience in these matters who can look at a crowd, however big, and tell you which among them is facing a charge. How can they do that, you will ask. My answer will not please you. It is simply that those who are facing a charge are the most attractive. It cannot be their guilt that makes them attractive as not all of them are guilty - at least that's what I, as a lawyer, have to say - and nor can it be the proper punishment that has made them attractive as not all of them are punished, so it can only be that the proceedings levelled against them take some kind of hold on them. Whatever the reason, some of these attractive people are indeed very",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,85,"attractive. But all of them are attractive, even Block, pitiful worm that he is."" As the lawyer finished what he was saying, K. was fully in control of himself, he had even nodded conspicuously at his last few words in order to confirm to himself the view he had already formed; that the lawyer was trying to confuse him, as he always did, by making general and irrelevant observations, and thus distract him from the main question of what he was actually doing for K.'s trial. The lawyer must have noticed that K. was offering him more resistance than before, as he became silent, giving K. the chance to speak himself, and then, as K. also remained silent, he asked, ""Did you have a particular reason for coming to see me today?"" ""Yes,"" said K., putting his hand up to slightly shade his eyes from the light of the candle so that he could see the lawyer better, ""I wanted to tell you that I'm withdrawing my representation from you, with immediate effect."" ""Do I understand you rightly?"" asked the lawyer as he half raised himself in his bed and supported himself with one hand on the pillow. ""I think you do,"" said K., sitting stiffly upright as if waiting in ambush. ""Well we can certainly discuss this plan of yours,"" said the lawyer after a pause. ""It's not a plan any more,"" said K. ""That may be,"" said the lawyer, ""but we still mustn't rush anything."" He used the word 'we', as if he had no intention of letting K. go free, and as if, even if he could no longer represent him, he could still at least continue as his adviser. ""Nothing is being rushed,"" said K., standing slowly up and going behind his chair, ""everything has been well thought out and probably even for too long. The decision is final."" ""Then allow me to say a few words,"" said the lawyer, throwing the bed cover to one side and sitting on the edge of the bed. His naked, white-haired legs shivered in the cold. He asked K. to pass him a blanket from the couch. K. passed him the blanket and said, ""You are running the risk of catching cold for no reason."" ""The circumstances are important enough,"" said the lawyer as he wrapped the bed cover around the top half of his body and then the blanket around his legs. ""Your uncle is my friend and in the course of time I've become fond of you as well. I admit that quite openly. There's nothing in that for me to be ashamed of."" It was very unwelcome for K. to hear the old man speak in this touching way, as it forced him to explain himself more fully, which he would rather have avoided, and he was aware that it also confused him even though it could never make him reverse his decision. ""Thank you for feeling so friendly toward me,"" he said, ""and I also realise how deeply involved you've been in my case, as deeply as possible for yourself and to bring as much advantage as possible to me. Nonetheless, I have recently come to the conviction that it is not enough. I would naturally never attempt, considering that you are so much older and more experienced than I am, to convince you of my opinion; if I have ever unintentionally done so then I beg your forgiveness, but, as you have just said yourself, the circumstances are important enough and it is my belief that my trial needs to be approached with much more vigour than has so far been the case."" ""I see,"" said the lawyer, ""you've become impatient."" ""I am not impatient,"" said K., with some irritation and he stopped paying so much attention to his choice of words. ""When I first came here with my uncle you probably noticed I wasn't greatly concerned about my case, and if I wasn't reminded of it by force, as it were, I would forget about it completely. But my uncle insisted I should allow you to represent me and I did so as a favour to him. I could have expected the case to be less of a burden than it had been, as the point of taking on a lawyer is that he should take on some of its weight. But what actually happened was the opposite. Before, the trial was never such a worry for me as it has been since you've been representing me. When I was by myself I never did anything about my case, I was hardly aware of it, but then, once there was someone representing me, everything was set for something to happen, I was always, without cease, waiting for you to do something, getting more",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,86,"and more tense, but you did nothing. I did get some information about the court from you that I probably could not have got anywhere else, but that can't be enough when the trial, supposedly in secret, is getting closer and closer to me."" K. had pushed the chair away and stood erect, his hands in the pockets of his frock coat. ""After a certain point in the proceedings,"" said the lawyer quietly and calmly, ""nothing new of any importance ever happens. So many litigants, at the same stage in their trials, have stood before me just like you are now and spoken in the same way."" ""Then these other litigants,"" said K., ""have all been right, just as I am. That does not show that I'm not."" ""I wasn't trying to show that you were mistaken,"" said the lawyer, ""but I wanted to add that I expected better judgement from you than from the others, especially as I've given you more insight into the workings of the court and my own activities than I normally do. And now I'm forced to accept that, despite everything, you have too little trust in me. You don't make it easy for me."" How the lawyer was humiliating himself to K.! He was showing no regard for the dignity of his position, which on this point, must have been at its most sensitive. And why did he do that? He did seem to be very busy as a lawyer as well a rich man, neither the loss of income nor the loss of a client could have been of much importance to him in themselves. He was moreover unwell and should have been thinking of passing work on to others. And despite all that he held on tightly to K. Why? Was it something personal for his uncle's sake, or did he really see K.'s case as one that was exceptional and hoped to be able to distinguish himself with it, either for K.'s sake or - and this possibility could never be excluded - for his friends at the court? It was not possible to learn anything by looking at him, even though K. was scrutinizing him quite brazenly. It could almost be supposed he was deliberately hiding his thoughts as he waited to see what effect his words would have. But he clearly deemed K.'s silence to be favourable for himself and he continued, ""You will have noticed the size of my office, but that I don't employ any staff to help me. That used to be quite different, there was a time when several young lawyers were working for me but now I work alone. This is partly to do with changes in the way I do business, in that I concentrate nowadays more and more on matters such as your own case, and partly to do with the ever deeper understanding that I acquire from these legal matters. I found that I could never let anyone else deal with this sort of work unless I wanted to harm both the client and the job I had taken on. But the decision to do all the work myself had its obvious result: I was forced to turn almost everyone away who asked me to represent them and could only accept those I was especially interested in - well there are enough creatures who leap at every crumb I throw down, and they're not so very far away. Most importantly, I became ill from over-work. But despite that I don't regret my decision, quite possibly I should have turned more cases away than I did, but it did turn out to be entirely necessary for me to devote myself fully to the cases I did take on, and the successful results showed that it was worth it. I once read a description of the difference between representing someone in ordinary legal matters and in legal matters of this sort, and the writer expressed it very well. This is what he said: some lawyers lead their clients on a thread until judgement is passed, but there are others who immediately lift their clients onto their shoulders and carry them all the way to the judgement and beyond. That's just how it is. But it was quite true when I said I never regret all this work. But if, as in your case, they are so fully misunderstood, well, then I come very close to regretting it."" All this talking did more to make K. impatient than to persuade him. From the way the lawyer was speaking, K. thought he could hear what he could expect if he gave in, the delays and excuses would begin again, reports of how the documents were progressing, how the mood of the court officials had improved,",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,87,"as well as all the enormous difficulties - in short all that he had heard so many times before would be brought out again even more fully, he would try to mislead K. with hopes that were never specified and to make him suffer with threats that were never clear. He had to put a stop to that, so he said, ""What will you undertake on my behalf if you continue to represent me?"" The lawyer quietly accepted even this insulting question, and answered, ""I should continue with what I've already been doing for you."" ""That's just what I thought,"" said K., ""and now you don't need to say another word."" ""I will make one more attempt,"" said the lawyer as if whatever had been making K. so annoyed was affecting him too. ""You see, I have the impression that you have not only misjudged the legal assistance I have given you but also that that misjudgement has led you to behave in this way, you seem, although you are the accused, to have been treated too well or, to put it a better way, handled with neglect, with apparent neglect. Even that has its reason; it is often better to be in chains than to be free. But I would like to show you how other defendants are treated, perhaps you will succeed in learning something from it. What I will do is I will call Block in, unlock the door and sit down here beside the bedside table."" ""Be glad to,"" said K., and did as the lawyer suggested; he was always ready to learn something new. But to make sure of himself for any event he added, ""but you do realise that you are no longer to be my lawyer, don't you?"" ""Yes,"" said the lawyer. ""But you can still change your mind today if you want to."" He lay back down in the bed, pulled the quilt up to his chin and turned to face the wall. Then he rang. Leni appeared almost the moment he had done so. She looked hurriedly at K. and the lawyer to try and find out what had happened; she seemed to be reassured by the sight of K. sitting calmly at the lawyer's bed. She smiled and nodded to K., K. looked blankly back at her. ""Fetch Block,"" said the lawyer. But instead of going to fetch him, Leni just went to the door and called out, ""Block! To the lawyer!"" Then, probably because the lawyer had turned his face to the wall and was paying no attention, she slipped in behind K.'s chair. From then on, she bothered him by leaning forward over the back of the chair or, albeit very tenderly and carefully, she would run her hands through his hair and over his cheeks. K. eventually tried to stop her by taking hold of one hand, and after some resistance Leni let him keep hold of it. Block came as soon as he was called, but he remained standing in the doorway and seemed to be wondering whether he should enter or not. He raised his eyebrows and lowered his head as if listening to find out whether the order to attend the lawyer would be repeated. K. could have encouraged to enter, but he had decided to make a final break not only with the lawyer but with everything in his home, so he kept himself motionless. Leni was also silent. Block noticed that at least no-one was chasing him away, and, on tiptoe, he entered the room, his face was tense, his hands were clenched behind his back. He left the door open in case he needed to go back again. K. did not even glance at him, he looked instead only at the thick quilt under which the lawyer could not be seen as he had squeezed up very close to the wall. Then his voice was heard: ""Block here?"" he asked. Block had already crept some way into the room but this question seemed to give him first a shove in the breast and then another in the back, he seemed about to fall but remained standing, deeply bowed, and said, ""At your service, sir."" ""What do you want?"" asked the lawyer, ""you've come at a bad time."" ""Wasn't I summoned?"" asked Block, more to himself than the lawyer. He held his hands in front of himself as protection and would have been ready to run away any moment. ""You were summoned,"" said the lawyer, ""but you have still come at a bad time."" Then, after a pause he added, ""You always come at a bad time."" When the lawyer started speaking Block had stopped looking at the bed but stared rather into one of the corners, just listening, as if the",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,88,"light from the speaker were brighter than Block could bear to look at. But it was also difficult for him to listen, as the lawyer was speaking into the wall and speaking quickly and quietly. ""Would you like me to go away again, sir?"" asked Block. ""Well you're here now,"" said the lawyer. ""Stay!"" It was as if the lawyer had not done as Block had wanted but instead threatened him with a stick, as now Block really began to shake. ""I went to see,"" said the lawyer, ""the third judge yesterday, a friend of mine, and slowly brought the conversation round to the subject of you. Do you want to know what he said?"" ""Oh, yes please,"" said Block. The lawyer did not answer immediately, so Block repeated his request and lowered his head as if about to kneel down. But then K. spoke to him: ""What do you think you're doing?"" he shouted. Leni had wanted to stop him from calling out and so he took hold of her other hand. It was not love that made him squeeze it and hold on to it so tightly, she sighed frequently and tried to disengage her hands from him. But Block was punished for K.'s outburst, as the lawyer asked him, ""Who is your lawyer?"" ""You are, sir,"" said Block. ""And who besides me?"" the lawyer asked. ""No-one besides you, sir,"" said Block. ""And let there be no-one besides me,"" said the lawyer. Block fully understood what that meant, he glowered at K., shaking his head violently. If these actions had been translated into words they would have been coarse insults. K. had been friendly and willing to discuss his own case with someone like this! ""I won't disturb you any more,"" said K., leaning back in his chair. ""You can kneel down or creep on all fours, whatever you like. I won't bother with you any more."" But Block still had some sense of pride, at least where K. was concerned, and he went towards him waving his fists, shouting as loudly as he dared while the lawyer was there. ""You shouldn't speak to me like that, that's not allowed. Why are you insulting me? Especially here in front of the lawyer, where both of us, you and me, we're only tolerated because of his charity. You not a better person than me, you've been accused of something too, you're facing a charge too. If, in spite of that, you're still a gentleman then I'm just as much a gentleman as you are, if not even more so. And I want to be spoken to as a gentleman, especially by you. If you think being allowed to sit there and quietly listen while I creep on all fours as you put it makes you something better than me, then there's an old legal saying you ought to bear in mind: If you're under suspicion it better to be moving than still, as if you're still you can be in the pan of the scales without knowing it and be weighed along with your sins."" K. said nothing. He merely looked in amazement at this distracted being, his eyes completely still. He had gone through such changes in just the last few hours! Was it the trial that was throwing him from side to side in this way and stopped him knowing who was friend and who was foe? Could he not see the lawyer was deliberately humiliating him and had no other purpose today than to show off his power to K., and perhaps even thereby subjugate K.? But if Block was incapable of seeing that, or if he so feared the lawyer that no such insight would even be of any use to him, how was it that he was either so sly or so bold as to lie to the lawyer and conceal from him the fact that he had other lawyers working on his behalf? And how did he dare to attack K., who could betray his secret any time he liked? But he dared even more than this, he went to the lawyer's bed and began there to make complaints about K. ""Dr. Huld, sir,"" he said, ""did you hear the way this man spoke to me? You can count the length of his trial in hours, and he wants to tell me what to do when I've been involved in a legal case for five years. He even insults me. He doesn't know anything, but he insults me, when I, as far as my weak ability allows, when I've made a close study of how to behave with the court, what we ought to do and what the court practices are."" ""Don't let anyone bother you,"" said the lawyer, ""and do what seems",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,89,"to you to be right."" ""I will,"" said Block, as if speaking to himself to give himself courage, and with a quick glance to the side he kneeled down close beside the bed. ""I'm kneeling now Dr. Huld, sir,"" he said. But the lawyer remained silent. With one hand, Block carefully stroked the bed cover. In the silence while he did so, Leni, as she freed herself from K.'s hands, said, ""You're hurting me. Let go of me. I'm going over to Block."" She went over to him and sat on the edge of the bed. Block was very pleased at this and with lively, but silent, gestures he immediately urged her to intercede for him with the lawyer. It was clear that he desperately needed to be told something by the lawyer, although perhaps only so that he could make use of the information with his other lawyers. Leni probably knew very well how the lawyer could be brought round, pointed to his hand and pursed her lips as if making a kiss. Block immediately performed the hand-kiss and, at further urging from Leni, repeated it twice more. But the lawyer continued to be silent. Then Leni leant over the lawyer, as she stretched out, the attractive shape of her body could be seen, and, bent over close to his face, she stroked his long white hair. That now forced him to give an answer. ""I'm rather wary of telling him,"" said the lawyer, and his head could be seen shaking slightly, perhaps so that he would feel the pressure of Leni's hand better. Block listened closely with his head lowered, as if by listening he were breaking an order. ""What makes you so wary about it?"" asked Leni. K. had the feeling he was listening to a contrived dialogue that had been repeated many times, that would be repeated many times more, and that for Block alone it would never lose its freshness. ""What has his behaviour been like today?"" asked the lawyer instead of an answer. Before Leni said anything she looked down at Block and watched him a short while as he raised his hands towards her and rubbed them together imploringly. Finally she gave a serious nod, turned back to the lawyer and said, ""He's been quiet and industrious."" This was an elderly businessman, a man whose beard was long, and he was begging a young girl to speak on his behalf. Even if there was some plan behind what he did, there was nothing that could reinstate him in the eyes of his fellow man. K. could not understand how the lawyer could have thought this performance would win him over. Even if he had done nothing earlier to make him want to leave then this scene would have done so. It was almost humiliating even for the onlooker. So these were the lawyer's methods, which K. fortunately had not been exposed to for long, to let the client forget about the whole world and leave him with nothing but the hope of reaching the end of his trial by this deluded means. He was no longer a client, he was the lawyer's dog. If the lawyer had ordered him to crawl under the bed as if it were a kennel and to bark out from under it, then he would have done so with enthusiasm. K. listened to all of this, testing it and thinking it over as if he had been given the task of closely observing everything spoken here, inform a higher office about it and write a report. ""And what has he been doing all day?"" asked the lawyer. ""I kept him locked in the maid's room all day,"" said Leni, ""so that he wouldn't stop me doing my work. That's where he usually stays. From time to time I looked in through the spyhole to see was he was doing, and each time he was kneeling on the bed and reading the papers you gave him, propped up on the window sill. That made a good impression on me; as the window only opens onto an air shaft and gives hardly any light. It showed how obedient he is that he was even reading in those conditions."" ""I'm pleased to hear it,"" said the lawyer. ""But did he understand what he was reading?"" While this conversation was going on, Block continually moved his lips and was clearly formulating the answers he hoped Leni would give. ""Well I can't give you any certain answer to that of course,"" said Leni, ""but I could see that he was reading thoroughly. He spent all day reading the same page, running his finger along the lines. Whenever I looked in on him he sighed as if this reading was a lot of work",no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,90,"for him. I expect the papers you gave him were very hard to understand."" ""Yes,"" said the lawyer, ""they certainly are that. And I really don't think he understood anything of them. But they should at least give him some inkling of just how hard a struggle it is and how much work it is for me to defend him. And who am I doing all this hard work for? I'm doing it - it's laughable even to say it - I'm doing it for Block. He ought to realise what that means, too. Did he study without a pause?"" ""Almost without a pause,"" answered Leni. ""Just the once he asked me for a drink of water, so I gave him a glassful through the window. Then at eight o'clock I let him out and gave him something to eat."" Block glanced sideways at K., as if he were being praised and had to impress K. as well. He now seemed more optimistic, he moved more freely and rocked back and forth on his knees. This made his astonishment all the more obvious when he heard the following words from the lawyer: ""You speak well of him,"" said the lawyer, ""but that's just what makes it difficult for me. You see, the judge did not speak well of him at all, neither about Block nor about his case."" ""Didn't speak well of him?"" asked Leni. ""How is that possible?"" Block looked at her with such tension he seemed to think that although the judge's words had been spoken so long before she would be able to change them in his favour. ""Not at all,"" said the lawyer. ""In fact he became quite cross when I started to talk about Block to him. 'Don't talk to me about Block,' he said. 'He is my client,' said I. 'You're letting him abuse you,' he said. 'I don't think his case is lost yet,' said I. 'You're letting him abuse you,' he repeated. 'I don't think so,' said I. 'Block works hard in his case and always knows where it stands. He practically lives with me so that he always knows what's happening. You don't always find such enthusiasm as that. He's not very pleasant personally, I grant you, his manners are terrible and he's dirty, but as far as the trial's concerned he's quite immaculate.' I said immaculate, but I was deliberately exaggerating. Then he said, 'Block is sly, that's all. He's accumulated plenty of experience and knows how to delay proceedings. But there's more that he doesn't know than he does. What do you think he'd say if he learned his trial still hasn't begun, if you told him they haven't even rung the bell to announce the start of proceedings?' Alright Block, alright,"" said the lawyer, as at these words Block had begun to raise himself on his trembling knees and clearly wanted to plead for some explanation. It was the first time the lawyer had spoken any clear words directly to Block. He looked down with his tired eyes, half blankly and half at Block, who slowly sank back down on his knees under this gaze. ""What the judge said has no meaning for you,"" said the lawyer. ""You needn't be frightened at every word. If you do it again I won't tell you anything else at all. It's impossible to start a sentence without you looking at me as if you were receiving your final judgement. You should be ashamed of yourself here in front of my client! And you're destroying the trust he has for me. Just what is it you want? You're still alive, you're still under my protection. There's no point in worrying! Somewhere you've read that the final judgement can often come without warning, from anyone at any time. And, in the right circumstances, that's basically true, but it's also true that I dislike your anxiety and fear and see that you don't have the trust in me you should have. Now what have I just said? I repeated something said by one of the judges. You know that there are so many various opinions about the procedure that they form into a great big pile and nobody can make any sense of them. This judge, for instance, sees proceedings as starting at a different point from where I do. A difference of opinion, nothing more. At a certain stage in the proceedings tradition has it that a sign is given by ringing a bell. This judge sees that as the point at which proceedings begin. I can't set out all the opinions opposed to that view here, and you wouldn't understand it anyway, suffice it to say that there are many reasons to disagree with him."" Embarrassed, Block ran his fingers through the",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,91,"pile of the carpet, his anxiety about what the judge had said had let him forget his inferior status towards the lawyer for a while, he thought only about himself and turned the judges words round to examine them from all sides. ""Block,"" said Leni, as if reprimanding him, and, taking hold of the collar of his coat, pulled him up slightly higher. ""Leave the carpet alone and listen to what the lawyer is saying."" This chapter was left unfinished. Chapter Nine In the Cathedral A very important Italian business contact of the bank had come to visit the city for the first time and K. was given the task of showing him some of its cultural sights. At any other time he would have seen this job as an honour but now, when he was finding it hard even to maintain his current position in the bank, he accepted it only with reluctance. Every hour that he could not be in the office was a cause of concern for him, he was no longer able to make use of his time in the office anything like as well as he had previously, he spent many hours merely pretending to do important work, but that only increased his anxiety about not being in the office. Then he sometimes thought he saw the deputy director, who was always watching, come into K.'s office, sit at his desk, look through his papers, receive clients who had almost become old friends of K., and lure them away from him, perhaps he even discovered mistakes, mistakes that seemed to threaten K. from a thousand directions when he was at work now, and which he could no longer avoid. So now, if he was ever asked to leave the office on business or even needed to make a short business trip, however much an honour it seemed - and tasks of this sort happened to have increased substantially recently - there was always the suspicion that they wanted to get him out of his office for a while and check his work, or at least the idea that they thought he was dispensable. It would not have been difficult for him to turn down most of these jobs, but he did not dare to do so because, if his fears had the slightest foundation, turning the jobs down would have been an acknowledgement of them. For this reason, he never demurred from accepting them, and even when he was asked to go on a tiring business trip lasting two days he said nothing about having to go out in the rainy autumn weather when he had a severe chill, just in order to avoid the risk of not being asked to go. When, with a raging headache, he arrived back from this trip he learned that he had been chosen to accompany the Italian business contact the following day. The temptation for once to turn the job down was very great, especially as it had no direct connection with business, but there was no denying that social obligations towards this business contact were in themselves important enough, only not for K., who knew quite well that he needed some successes at work if he was to maintain his position there and that, if he failed in that, it would not help him even if this Italian somehow found him quite charming; he did not want to be removed from his workplace for even one day, as the fear of not being allowed back in was too great, he knew full well that the fear was exaggerated but it still made him anxious. However, in this case it was almost impossible to think of an acceptable excuse, his knowledge of Italian was not great but still good enough; the deciding factor was that K. had earlier known a little about art history and this had become widely known around the bank in extremely exaggerated form, and that K. had been a member of the Society for the Preservation of City Monuments, albeit only for business reasons. It was said that this Italian was an art lover, so the choice of K. to accompany him was a matter of course. It was a very rainy and stormy morning when K., in a foul temper at the thought of the day ahead of him, arrived early at seven o'clock in the office so that he could at least do some work before his visitor would prevent him. He had spent half the night studying a book of Italian grammar so that he would be somewhat prepared and was very tired; his desk was less attractive to him than the window where he had spent far too much time sitting of late, but he resisted the temptation and sat",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,92,"down to his work. Unfortunately, just then the servitor came in and reported that the director had sent him to see whether the chief clerk was already in his office; if he was, then would he please be so kind as to come to his reception room as the gentleman from Italy was already there. ""I'll come straight away,"" said K. He put a small dictionary in his pocket, took a guide to the city's tourist sites under his arm that he had compiled for strangers, and went through the deputy director's office into that of the director. He was glad he had come into the office so early and was able to be of service immediately, nobody could seriously have expected that of him. The deputy director's office was, of course, still as empty as the middle of the night, the servitor had probably been asked to summon him too but without success. As K. entered the reception room two men stood up from the deep armchairs where they had been sitting. The director gave him a friendly smile, he was clearly very glad that K. was there, he immediately introduced him to the Italian who shook K.'s hand vigorously and joked that somebody was an early riser. K. did not quite understand whom he had in mind, it was moreover an odd expression to use and it took K. a little while to guess its meaning. He replied with a few bland phrases which the Italian received once more with a laugh, passing his hand nervously and repeatedly over his blue-grey, bushy moustache. This moustache was obviously perfumed, it was almost tempting to come close to it and sniff. When they had all sat down and begun a light preliminary conversation, K. was disconcerted to notice that he understood no more than fragments of what the Italian said. When he spoke very calmly he understood almost everything, but that was very infrequent, mostly the words gushed from his mouth and he seemed to be enjoying himself so much his head shook. When he was talking in this way his speech was usually wrapped up in some kind of dialect which seemed to K. to have nothing to do with Italian but which the director not only understood but also spoke, although K. ought to have foreseen this as the Italian came from the south of his country where the director had also spent several years. Whatever the cause, K. realised that the possibility of communicating with the Italian had been largely taken from him, even his French was difficult to understand, and his moustache concealed the movements of his lips which might have offered some help in understanding what he said. K. began to anticipate many difficulties, he gave up trying to understand what the Italian said - with the director there, who could understand him so easily, it would have been pointless effort - and for the time being did no more than scowl at the Italian as he relaxed sitting deep but comfortable in the armchair, as he frequently pulled at his short, sharply tailored jacket and at one time lifted his arms in the air and moved his hands freely to try and depict something that K. could not grasp, even though he was leaning forward and did not let the hands out of his sight. K. had nothing to occupy himself but mechanically watch the exchange between the two men and his tiredness finally made itself felt, to his alarm, although fortunately in good time, he once caught himself nearly getting up, turning round and leaving. Eventually the Italian looked at the clock and jumped up. After taking his leave from the director he turned to K., pressing himself so close to him that K. had to push his chair back just so that he could move. The director had, no doubt, seen the anxiety in K.'s eyes as he tried to cope with this dialect of Italian, he joined in with this conversation in a way that was so adroit and unobtrusive that he seemed to be adding no more than minor comments, whereas in fact he was swiftly and patiently breaking into what the Italian said so that K. could understand. K. learned in this way that the Italian first had a few business matters to settle, that he unfortunately had only a little time at his disposal, that he certainly did not intend to rush round to see every monument in the city, that he would much rather - at least as long as K. would agree, it was entirely his decision - just see the cathedral and to do so thoroughly. He was extremely pleased to be accompanied by someone who was so learned and so pleasant - by this",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,93,"he meant K., who was occupied not with listening to the Italian but the director - and asked if he would be so kind, if the time was suitable, to meet him in the cathedral in two hours' time at about ten o'clock. He hoped he would certainly be able to be there at that time. K. made an appropriate reply, the Italian shook first the director's hand and then K.'s, then the director's again and went to the door, half turned to the two men who followed him and continuing to talk without a break. K. remained together with the director for a short while, although the director looked especially unhappy today. He thought he needed to apologise to K. for something and told him - they were standing intimately close together - he had thought at first he would accompany the Italian himself, but then - he gave no more precise reason than this - then he decided it would be better to send K. with him. He should not be surprised if he could not understand the Italian at first, he would be able to very soon, and even if he really could not understand very much he said it was not so bad, as it was really not so important for the Italian to be understood. And anyway, K.'s knowledge of Italian was surprisingly good, the director was sure he would get by very well. And with that, it was time for K. to go. He spent the time still remaining to him with a dictionary, copying out obscure words he would need to guide the Italian round the cathedral. It was an extremely irksome task, servitors brought him the mail, bank staff came with various queries and, when they saw that K. was busy, stood by the door and did not go away until he had listened to them, the deputy director did not miss the opportunity to disturb K. and came in frequently, took the dictionary from his hand and flicked through its pages, clearly for no purpose, when the door to the ante-room opened even clients would appear from the half darkness and bow timidly to him - they wanted to attract his attention but were not sure whether he had seen them - all this activity was circling around K. with him at its centre while he compiled the list of words he would need, then looked them up in the dictionary, then wrote them out, then practised their pronunciation and finally tried to learn them by heart. The good intentions he had had earlier, though, seemed to have left him completely, it was the Italian who had caused him all this effort and sometimes he became so angry with him that he buried the dictionary under some papers firmly intending to do no more preparation, but then he realised he could not walk up and down in the cathedral with the Italian without saying a word, so, with in an even greater rage, he pulled the dictionary back out again. At exactly half past nine, just when he was about to leave, there was a telephone call for him, Leni wished him good morning and asked how he was, K. thanked her hurriedly and told her it was impossible for him to talk now as he had to go to the cathedral. ""To the cathedral?"" asked Leni. ""Yes, to the cathedral."" ""What do you have to go to the cathedral for?"" said Leni. K. tried to explain it to her briefly, but he had hardly begun when Leni suddenly said, ""They're harassing you."" One thing that K. could not bear was pity that he had not wanted or expected, he took his leave of her with two words, but as he put the receiver back in its place he said, half to himself and half to the girl on the other end of the line who could no longer hear him, ""Yes, they're harassing me."" By now the time was late and there was almost a danger he would not be on time. He took a taxi to the cathedral, at the last moment he had remembered the album that he had had no opportunity to give to the Italian earlier and so took it with him now. He held it on his knees and drummed impatiently on it during the whole journey. The rain had eased off slightly but it was still damp chilly and dark, it would be difficult to see anything in the cathedral but standing about on cold flagstones might well make K.'s chill much worse. The square in front of the cathedral was quite empty, K. remembered how even as a small child he had noticed that nearly all the houses in this narrow square had",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Trial - Franz Kafka,94,"the curtains at their windows closed most of the time, although today, with the weather like this, it was more understandable. The cathedral also seemed quite empty, of course no-one would think of going there on a day like this. K. hurried along both the side naves but saw no-one but an old woman who, wrapped up in a warm shawl, was kneeling at a picture of the Virgin Mary and staring up at it. Then, in the distance, he saw a church official who limped away through a doorway in the wall. K. had arrived on time, it had struck ten just as he was entering the building, but the Italian still was not there. K. went back to the main entrance, stood there indecisively for a while, and then walked round the cathedral in the rain in case the Italian was waiting at another entrance. He was nowhere to be found. Could the director have misunderstood what time they had agreed on? How could anyone understand someone like that properly anyway? Whatever had happened, K. would have to wait for him for at least half an hour. As he was tired he wanted to sit down, he went back inside the cathedral, he found something like a small carpet on one of the steps, he moved it with his foot to a nearby pew, wrapped himself up tighter in his coat, put the collar up and sat down. To pass the time he opened the album and flicked through the pages a little but soon had to give up as it became so dark that when he looked up he could hardly make out anything in the side nave next to him. In the distance there was a large triangle of candles flickering on the main altar, K. was not certain whether he had seen them earlier. Perhaps they had only just been lit. Church staff creep silently as part of their job, you don't notice them. When K. happened to turn round he also saw a tall, stout candle attached to a column not far behind him. It was all very pretty, but totally inadequate to illuminate the pictures which were usually left in the darkness of the side altars, and seemed to make the darkness all the deeper. It was discourteous of the Italian not to come but it was also sensible of him, there would have been nothing to see, they would have had to content themselves with seeking out a few pictures with K.'s electric pocket torch and looking at them one small part at a time. K. went over to a nearby side chapel to see what they could have hoped for, he went up a few steps to a low marble railing and leant over it to look at the altar picture by the light of his torch. The eternal light hung disturbingly in front of it. The first thing that K. partly saw and partly guessed at was a large knight in armour who was shown at the far edge of the painting. He was leaning on his sword that he had stuck into the naked ground in front of him where only a few blades of grass grew here and there. He seemed to be paying close attention to something that was being played out in front of him. It was astonishing to see how he stood there without going any closer. Perhaps it was his job to stand guard. It was a long time since K. had looked at any pictures and he studied the knight for a long time even though he had continually to blink as he found it difficult to bear the green light of his torch. Then when he moved the light to the other parts of the picture he found an interment of Christ shown in the usual way, it was also a comparatively new painting. He put his torch away and went back to his place. There seemed to be no point in waiting for the Italian any longer, but outside it was certainly raining heavily, and as it was not so cold in the cathedral as K. had expected he decided to stay there for the time being. Close by him was the great pulpit, there were two plain golden crosses attached to its little round roof which were lying almost flat and whose tips crossed over each other. The outside of the pulpit's balustrade was covered in green foliage which continued down to the column supporting it, little angels could be seen among the leaves, some of them lively and some of them still. K. walked up to the pulpit and examined it from all sides, its stonework had been sculpted with great care, it seemed as if the foliage had",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,95,"trapped a deep darkness between and behind its leaves and held it there prisoner, K. lay his hand in one of these gaps and cautiously felt the stone, until then he had been totally unaware of this pulpit's existence. Then K. happened to notice one of the church staff standing behind the next row of pews, he wore a loose, creased, black cassock, he held a snuff box in his left hand and he was watching K. Now what does he want? thought K. Do I seem suspicious to him? Does he want a tip? But when the man in the cassock saw that K. had noticed him he raised his right hand, a pinch of snuff still held between two fingers, and pointed in some vague direction. It was almost impossible to understand what this behaviour meant, K. waited a while longer but the man in the cassock did not stop gesturing with his hand and even augmented it by nodding his head. ""Now what does he want?"" asked K. quietly, he did not dare call out loud here; but then he drew out his purse and pushed his way through the nearest pews to reach the man. He, however, immediately gestured to turn down this offer, shrugged his shoulders and limped away. As a child K. had imitated riding on a horse with the same sort of movement as this limp. ""This old man is like a child,"" thought K., ""he doesn't have the sense for anything more than serving in a church. Look at the way he stops when I stop, and how he waits to see whether I'll continue."" With a smile, K. followed the old man all the way up the side nave and almost as far as the main altar, all this time the old man continued to point at something but K. deliberately avoided looking round, he was only pointing in order to make it harder for K. to follow him. Eventually, K. did stop following, he did not want to worry the old man too much, and he also did not want to frighten him away completely in case the Italian turned up after all. When he entered the central nave to go back to where he had left the album, he noticed a small secondary pulpit on a column almost next to the stalls by the altar where the choir sat. It was very simple, made of plain white stone, and so small that from a distance it looked like an empty niche where the statue of a saint ought to have been. It certainly would have been impossible for the priest to take a full step back from the balustrade, and, although there was no decoration on it, the top of the pulpit curved in exceptionally low so that a man of average height would not be able stand upright and would have to remain bent forward over the balustrade. In all, it looked as if it had been intended to make the priest suffer, it was impossible to understand why this pulpit would be needed as there were also the other ones available which were large and so artistically decorated. And K. would certainly not have noticed this little pulpit if there had not been a lamp fastened above it, which usually meant there was a sermon about to be given. So was a sermon to be given now? In this empty church? K. looked down at the steps which, pressed close against the column, led up to the pulpit. They were so narrow they seemed to be there as decoration on the column rather than for anyone to use. But under the pulpit - K. grinned in astonishment - there really was a priest standing with his hand on the handrail ready to climb the steps and looking at K. Then he nodded very slightly, so that K. crossed himself and genuflected as he should have done earlier. With a little swing, the priest went up into the pulpit with short fast steps. Was there really a sermon about to begin? Maybe the man in the cassock had not been really so demented, and had meant to lead K.'s way to the preacher, which in this empty church would have been very necessary. And there was also, somewhere in front of a picture of the Virgin Mary, an old woman who should have come to hear the sermon. And if there was to be a sermon why had it not been introduced on the organ? But the organ remained quiet and merely looked out weakly from the darkness of its great height. K. now considered whether he should leave as quickly as possible, if he did not do it now there would be no chance of doing so",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,96,"during the sermon and he would have to stay there for as long as it lasted, he had lost so much time when he should have been in his office, there had long been no need for him to wait for the Italian any longer, he looked at his watch, it was eleven. But could there really be a sermon given? Could K. constitute the entire congregation? How could he when he was just a stranger who wanted to look at the church? That, basically, was all he was. The idea of a sermon, now, at eleven o'clock, on a workday, in hideous weather, was nonsense. The priest - there was no doubt that he was a priest, a young man with a smooth, dark face - was clearly going up there just to put the lamp out after somebody had lit it by mistake. But there had been no mistake, the priest seemed rather to check that the lamp was lit and turned it a little higher, then he slowly turned to face the front and leant down on the balustrade gripping its angular rail with both hands. He stood there like that for a while and, without turning his head, looked around. K. had moved back a long way and leant his elbows on the front pew. Somewhere in the church - he could not have said exactly where - he could make out the man in the cassock hunched under his bent back and at peace, as if his work were completed. In the cathedral it was now very quiet! But K. would have to disturb that silence, he had no intention of staying there; if it was the priest's duty to preach at a certain time regardless of the circumstances then he could, and he could do it without K.'s taking part, and K.'s presence would do nothing to augment the effect of it. So K. began slowly to move, felt his way on tiptoe along the pew, arrived at the broad aisle and went along it without being disturbed, except for the sound of his steps, however light, which rang out on the stone floor and resounded from the vaulting, quiet but continuous at a repeating, regular pace. K. felt slightly abandoned as, probably observed by the priest, he walked by himself between the empty pews, and the size of the cathedral seemed to be just at the limit of what a man could bear. When he arrived back at where he had been sitting he did not hesitate but simply reached out for the album he had left there and took it with him. He had nearly left the area covered by pews and was close to the empty space between himself and the exit when, for the first time, he heard the voice of the priest. A powerful and experienced voice. It pierced through the reaches of the cathedral ready waiting for it! But the priest was not calling out to the congregation, his cry was quite unambiguous and there was no escape from it, he called ""Josef K.!"" K. stood still and looked down at the floor. In theory he was still free, he could have carried on walking, through one of three dark little wooden doors not far in front of him and away from there. It would simply mean he had not understood, or that he had understood but chose not to pay attention to it. But if he once turned round he would be trapped, then he would have acknowledged that he had understood perfectly well, that he really was the Josef K. the priest had called to and that he was willing to follow. If the priest had called out again K. would certainly have carried on out the door, but everything was silent as K. also waited, he turned his head slightly as he wanted to see what the priest was doing now. He was merely standing in the pulpit as before, but it was obvious that he had seen K. turn his head. If K. did not now turn round completely it would have been like a child playing hide and seek. He did so, and the priest beckoned him with his finger. As everything could now be done openly he ran - because of curiosity and the wish to get it over with - with long flying leaps towards the pulpit. At the front pews he stopped, but to the priest he still seemed too far away, he reached out his hand and pointed sharply down with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit. And K. did as he was told, standing in that place he had to bend his head a long way back just to see the priest. ""You",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,97,"are Josef K.,"" said the priest, and raised his hand from the balustrade to make a gesture whose meaning was unclear. ""Yes,"" said K., he considered how freely he had always given his name in the past, for some time now it had been a burden to him, now there were people who knew his name whom he had never seen before, it had been so nice first to introduce yourself and only then for people to know who you were. ""You have been accused,"" said the priest, especially gently. ""Yes,"" said K., ""so I have been informed."" ""Then you are the one I am looking for,"" said the priest. ""I am the prison chaplain."" ""I see,"" said K. ""I had you summoned here,"" said the priest, ""because I wanted to speak to you."" ""I knew nothing of that,"" said K. ""I came here to show the cathedral to a gentleman from Italy."" ""That is beside the point,"" said the priest. ""What are you holding in your hand? Is it a prayer book?"" ""No,"" answered K., ""it's an album of the city's tourist sights."" ""Put it down,"" said the priest. K. threw it away with such force that it flapped open and rolled across the floor, tearing its pages. ""Do you know your case is going badly?"" asked the priest. ""That's how it seems to me too,"" said K. ""I've expended a lot of effort on it, but so far with no result. Although I do still have some documents to submit."" ""How do you imagine it will end?"" asked the priest. ""At first I thought it was bound to end well,"" said K., ""but now I have my doubts about it. I don't know how it will end. Do you know?"" ""I don't,"" said the priest, ""but I fear it will end badly. You are considered guilty. Your case will probably not even go beyond a minor court. Provisionally at least, your guilt is seen as proven."" ""But I'm not guilty,"" said K., ""there's been a mistake. How is it even possible for someone to be guilty. We're all human beings here, one like the other."" ""That is true,"" said the priest, ""but that is how the guilty speak."" ""Do you presume I'm guilty too?"" asked K. ""I make no presumptions about you,"" said the priest. ""I thank you for that,"" said K. ""but everyone else involved in these proceedings has something against me and presumes I'm guilty. They even influence those who aren't involved. My position gets harder all the time."" ""You don't understand the facts,"" said the priest, ""the verdict does not come suddenly, proceedings continue until a verdict is reached gradually."" ""I see,"" said K., lowering his head. ""What do you intend to do about your case next?"" asked the priest. ""I still need to find help,"" said K., raising his head to see what the priest thought of this. ""There are still certain possibilities I haven't yet made use of."" ""You look for too much help from people you don't know,"" said the priest disapprovingly, ""and especially from women. Can you really not see that's not the help you need?"" ""Sometimes, in fact quite often, I could believe you're right,"" said K., ""but not always. Women have a lot of power. If I could persuade some of the women I know to work together with me then I would be certain to succeed. Especially in a court like this that seems to consist of nothing but woman-chasers. Show the examining judge a woman in the distance and he'll run right over the desk, and the accused, just to get to her as soon as he can."" The priest lowered his head down to the balustrade, only now did the roof over the pulpit seem to press him down. What sort of dreadful weather could it be outside? It was no longer just a dull day, it was deepest night. None of the stained glass in the main window shed even a flicker of light on the darkness of the walls. And this was the moment when the man in the cassock chose to put out the candles on the main altar, one by one. ""Are you cross with me?"" asked K. ""Maybe you don't know what sort of court it is you serve."" He received no answer. ""Well, it's just my own experience,"" said K. Above him there was still silence. ""I didn't mean to insult you,"" said K. At that, the priest screamed down at K.: ""Can you not see two steps in front of you?"" He shouted in anger, but it was also the scream of one who sees another fall and, shocked and without thinking, screams against his own will. The two men, then, remained silent for a long time. In the",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,98,"darkness beneath him, the priest could not possibly have seen K. distinctly, although K. was able to see him clearly by the light of the little lamp. Why did the priest not come down? He had not given a sermon, he had only told K. a few things which, if he followed them closely, would probably cause him more harm than good. But the priest certainly seemed to mean well, it might even be possible, if he would come down and cooperate with him, it might even be possible for him to obtain some acceptable piece of advice that could make all the difference, it might, for instance, be able to show him not so much to influence the proceedings but how to break free of them, how to evade them, how to live away from them. K. had to admit that this was something he had had on his mind quite a lot of late. If the priest knew of such a possibility he might, if K. asked him, let him know about it, even though he was part of the court himself and even though, when K. had criticised the court, he had held down his gentle nature and actually shouted at K. ""Would you not like to come down here?"" asked K. ""If you're not going to give a sermon come down here with me."" ""Now I can come down,"" said the priest, perhaps he regretted having shouted at K. As he took down the lamp from its hook he said, ""to start off with I had to speak to you from a distance. Otherwise I'm too easily influenced and forget my duty."" K. waited for him at the foot of the steps. While he was still on one of the higher steps as he came down them the priest reached out his hand for K. to shake. ""Can you spare me a little of your time?"" asked K. ""As much time as you need,"" said the priest, and passed him the little lamp for him to carry. Even at close distance the priest did not lose a certain solemnity that seemed to be part of his character. ""You are very friendly towards me,"" said K., as they walked up and down beside each other in the darkness of one of the side naves. ""That makes you an exception among all those who belong to the court. I can trust you more than any of the others I've seen. I can speak openly with you."" ""Don't fool yourself,"" said the priest. ""How would I be fooling myself?"" asked K. ""You fool yourself in the court,"" said the priest, ""it talks about this self-deceit in the opening paragraphs to the law. In front of the law there is a doorkeeper. A man from the countryside comes up to the door and asks for entry. But the doorkeeper says he can't let him in to the law right now. The man thinks about this, and then he asks if he'll be able to go in later on. 'That's possible,' says the doorkeeper, 'but not now'. The gateway to the law is open as it always is, and the doorkeeper has stepped to one side, so the man bends over to try and see in. When the doorkeeper notices this he laughs and says, 'If you're tempted give it a try, try and go in even though I say you can't. Careful though: I'm powerful. And I'm only the lowliest of all the doormen. But there's a doorkeeper for each of the rooms and each of them is more powerful than the last. It's more than I can stand just to look at the third one.' The man from the country had not expected difficulties like this, the law was supposed to be accessible for anyone at any time, he thinks, but now he looks more closely at the doorkeeper in his fur coat, sees his big hooked nose, his long thin tartar-beard, and he decides it's better to wait until he has permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit down to one side of the gate. He sits there for days and years. He tries to be allowed in time and again and tires the doorkeeper with his requests. The doorkeeper often questions him, asking about where he's from and many other things, but these are disinterested questions such as great men ask, and he always ends up by telling him he still can't let him in. The man had come well equipped for his journey, and uses everything, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper. He accepts everything, but as he does so he says, 'I'll only accept this so that you don't think there's anything you've failed to do'. Over many years,",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,99,"the man watches the doorkeeper almost without a break. He forgets about the other doormen, and begins to think this one is the only thing stopping him from gaining access to the law. Over the first few years he curses his unhappy condition out loud, but later, as he becomes old, he just grumbles to himself. He becomes senile, and as he has come to know even the fleas in the doorkeeper's fur collar over the years that he has been studying him he even asks them to help him and change the doorkeeper's mind. Finally his eyes grow dim, and he no longer knows whether it's really getting darker or just his eyes that are deceiving him. But he seems now to see an inextinguishable light begin to shine from the darkness behind the door. He doesn't have long to live now. Just before he dies, he brings together all his experience from all this time into one question which he has still never put to the doorkeeper. He beckons to him, as he's no longer able to raise his stiff body. The doorkeeper has to bend over deeply as the difference in their sizes has changed very much to the disadvantage of the man. 'What is it you want to know now?' asks the doorkeeper, 'You're insatiable.' 'Everyone wants access to the law,' says the man, 'how come, over all these years, no-one but me has asked to be let in?' The doorkeeper can see the man's come to his end, his hearing has faded, and so, so that he can be heard, he shouts to him: 'Nobody else could have got in this way, as this entrance was meant only for you. Now I'll go and close it'."" ""So the doorkeeper cheated the man,"" said K. immediately, who had been captivated by the story. ""Don't be too quick,"" said the priest, ""don't take somebody else's opinion without checking it. I told you the story exactly as it was written. There's nothing in there about cheating."" ""But it's quite clear,"" said K., ""and your first interpretation of it was quite correct. The doorkeeper gave him the information that would release him only when it could be of no more use."" ""He didn't ask him before that,"" said the priest, ""and don't forget he was only a doorkeeper, and as doorkeeper he did his duty."" ""What makes you think he did his duty?"" asked K., ""He didn't. It might have been his duty to keep everyone else away, but this man is who the door was intended for and he ought to have let him in."" ""You're not paying enough attention to what was written and you're changing the story,"" said the priest. ""According to the story, there are two important things that the doorkeeper explains about access to the law, one at the beginning, one at the end. At one place he says he can't allow him in now, and at the other he says this entrance was intended for him alone. If one of the statements contradicted the other you would be right and the doorkeeper would have cheated the man from the country. But there is no contradiction. On the contrary, the first statement even hints at the second. You could almost say the doorkeeper went beyond his duty in that he offered the man some prospect of being admitted in the future. Throughout the story, his duty seems to have been merely to turn the man away, and there are many commentators who are surprised that the doorkeeper offered this hint at all, as he seems to love exactitude and keeps strict guard over his position. He stays at his post for many years and doesn't close the gate until the very end, he's very conscious of the importance of his service, as he says, 'I'm powerful,' he has respect for his superiors, as he says, 'I'm only the lowliest of the doormen', he's not talkative, as through all these years the only questions he asks are 'disinterested', he's not corruptible, as when he's offered a gift he says, 'I'll only accept this so that you don't think there's anything you've failed to do,' as far as fulfilling his duty goes he can be neither ruffled nor begged, as it says about the man that, 'he tires the doorkeeper with his requests', even his external appearance suggests a pedantic character, the big hooked nose and the long, thin, black tartar-beard. How could any doorkeeper be more faithful to his duty? But in the doorkeeper's character there are also other features which might be very useful for those who seek entry to the law, and when he hinted at some possibility in the future it always seemed to make it clear that he might even go",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,100,"beyond his duty. There's no denying he's a little simple minded, and that makes him a little conceited. Even if all he said about his power and the power of the other doorkeepers and how not even he could bear the sight of them - I say even if all these assertions are right, the way he makes them shows that he's too simple and arrogant to understand properly. The commentators say about this that, 'correct understanding of a matter and a misunderstanding of the same matter are not mutually exclusive'. Whether they're right or not, you have to concede that his simplicity and arrogance, however little they show, do weaken his function of guarding the entrance, they are defects in the doorkeeper's character. You also have to consider that the doorkeeper seems to be friendly by nature, he isn't always just an official. He makes a joke right at the beginning, in that he invites the man to enter at the same time as maintaining the ban on his entering, and then he doesn't send him away but gives him, as it says in the text, a stool to sit on and lets him stay by the side of the door. The patience with which he puts up with the man's requests through all these years, the little questioning sessions, accepting the gifts, his politeness when he puts up with the man cursing his fate even though it was the doorkeeper who caused that fate - all these things seem to want to arouse our sympathy. Not every doorkeeper would have behaved in the same way. And finally, he lets the man beckon him and he bends deep down to him so that he can put his last question. There's no more than some slight impatience - the doorkeeper knows everything's come to its end - shown in the words, 'You're insatiable'. There are many commentators who go even further in explaining it in this way and think the words, 'you're insatiable' are an expression of friendly admiration, albeit with some condescension. However you look at it the figure of the doorkeeper comes out differently from how you might think."" ""You know the story better than I do and you've known it for longer,"" said K. They were silent for a while. And then K. said, ""So you think the man was not cheated, do you?"" ""Don't get me wrong,"" said the priest, ""I'm just pointing out the different opinions about it. You shouldn't pay too much attention to people's opinions. The text cannot be altered, and the various opinions are often no more than an expression of despair over it. There's even one opinion which says it's the doorkeeper who's been cheated."" ""That does seem to take things too far,"" said K. ""How can they argue the doorkeeper has been cheated?"" ""Their argument,"" answered the priest, ""is based on the simplicity of the doorkeeper. They say the doorkeeper doesn't know the inside of the law, only the way into it where he just walks up and down. They see his ideas of what's inside the law as rather childish, and suppose he's afraid himself of what he wants to make the man frightened of. Yes, he's more afraid of it than the man, as the man wants nothing but to go inside the law, even after he's heard about the terrible doormen there, in contrast to the doorkeeper who doesn't want to go in, or at least we don't hear anything about it. On the other hand, there are those who say he must have already been inside the law as he has been taken on into its service and that could only have been done inside. That can be countered by supposing he could have been given the job of doorkeeper by somebody calling out from inside, and that he can't have gone very far inside as he couldn't bear the sight of the third doorkeeper. Nor, through all those years, does the story say the doorkeeper told the man anything about the inside, other than his comment about the other doorkeepers. He could have been forbidden to do so, but he hasn't said anything about that either. All this seems to show he doesn't know anything about what the inside looks like or what it means, and that that's why he's being deceived. But he's also being deceived by the man from the country as he's this man's subordinate and doesn't know it. There's a lot to indicate that he treats the man as his subordinate, I expect you remember, but those who hold this view would say it's very clear that he really is his subordinate. Above all, the free man is superior to the man who has to serve another. Now, the man really",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,101,"is free, he can go wherever he wants, the only thing forbidden to him is entry into the law and, what's more, there's only one man forbidding him to do so - the doorkeeper. If he takes the stool and sits down beside the door and stays there all his life he does this of his own free will, there's nothing in the story to say he was forced to do it. On the other hand, the doorkeeper is kept to his post by his employment, he's not allowed to go away from it and it seems he's not allowed to go inside either, not even if he wanted to. Also, although he's in the service of the law he's only there for this one entrance, therefore he's there only in the service of this one man who the door's intended for. This is another way in which he's his subordinate. We can take it that he's been performing this somewhat empty service for many years, through the whole of a man's life, as it says that a man will come, that means someone old enough to be a man. That means the doorkeeper will have to wait a long time before his function is fulfilled, he will have to wait for as long as the man liked, who came to the door of his own free will. Even the end of the doorkeeper's service is determined by when the man's life ends, so the doorkeeper remains his subordinate right to the end. And it's pointed out repeatedly that the doorkeeper seems to know nothing of any of this, although this is not seen as anything remarkable, as those who hold this view see the doorkeeper as deluded in a way that's far worse, a way that's to do with his service. At the end, speaking about the entrance he says, 'Now I'll go and close it', although at the beginning of the story it says the door to the law is open as it always is, but if it's always open - always - that means it's open independently of the lifespan of the man it's intended for, and not even the doorkeeper will be able to close it. There are various opinions about this, some say the doorkeeper was only answering a question or showing his devotion to duty or, just when the man was in his last moments, the doorkeeper wanted to cause him regret and sorrow. There are many who agree that he wouldn't be able to close the door. They even believe, at the end at least, the doorkeeper is aware, deep down, that he's the man's subordinate, as the man sees the light that shines out of the entry to the law whereas the doorkeeper would probably have his back to it and says nothing at all to show there's been any change."" ""That is well substantiated,"" said K., who had been repeating some parts of the priest's explanation to himself in a whisper. ""It is well substantiated, and now I too think the doorkeeper must have been deceived. Although that does not mean I've abandoned what I thought earlier as the two versions are, to some extent, not incompatible. It's not clear whether the doorkeeper sees clearly or is deceived. I said the man had been cheated. If the doorkeeper understands clearly, then there could be some doubt about it, but if the doorkeeper has been deceived then the man is bound to believe the same thing. That would mean the doorkeeper is not a cheat but so simple- minded that he ought to be dismissed from his job immediately; if the doorkeeper is mistaken it will do him no harm but the man will be harmed immensely."" ""There you've found another opinion,"" said the priest, ""as there are many who say the story doesn't give anyone the right to judge the doorkeeper. However he might seem to us he is still in the service of the law, so he belongs to the law, so he's beyond what man has a right to judge. In this case we can't believe the doorkeeper is the man's subordinate. Even if he has to stay at the entrance into the law his service makes him incomparably more than if he lived freely in the world. The man has come to the law for the first time and the doorkeeper is already there. He's been given his position by the law, to doubt his worth would be to doubt the law."" ""I can't say I'm in complete agreement with this view,"" said K. shaking his head, ""as if you accept it you'll have to accept that everything said by the doorkeeper is true. But you've already explained very fully that that's not possible."" ""No,"" said the priest,",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,102,"""you don't need to accept everything as true, you only have to accept it as necessary."" ""Depressing view,"" said K. ""The lie made into the rule of the world."" K. said that as if it were his final word but it was not his conclusion. He was too tired to think about all the ramifications of the story, and the sort of thoughts they led him into were not familiar to him, unrealistic things, things better suited for officials of the court to discuss than for him. The simple story had lost its shape, he wanted to shake it off, and the priest who now felt quite compassionate allowed this and accepted K.'s remarks without comment, even though his view was certainly very different from K.'s. In silence, they carried on walking for some time, K. stayed close beside the priest without knowing where he was. The lamp in his hand had long since gone out. Once, just in front of him, he thought he could see the statue of a saint by the glitter of the silver on it, although it quickly disappeared back into the darkness. So that he would not remain entirely dependent on the priest, K. asked him, ""We're now near the main entrance, are we?"" ""No,"" said the priest, ""we're a long way from it. Do you already want to go?"" K. had not thought of going until then, but he immediately said, ""Yes, certainly, I have to go. I'm the chief clerk in a bank and there are people waiting for me, I only came here to show a foreign business contact round the cathedral."" ""Alright,"" said the priest offering him his hand, ""go then."" ""But I can't find my way round in this darkness by myself,"" said K. ""Go to your left as far as the wall,"" said the priest, ""then continue alongside the wall without leaving it and you'll find a way out."" The priest had only gone a few paces from him, but K. was already shouting loudly, ""Please, wait!"" ""I'm waiting,"" said the priest. ""Is there anything else you want from me?"" asked K. ""No,"" said the priest. ""You were so friendly to me earlier on,"" said K., ""and you explained everything, but now you abandon me as if I were nothing to you."" ""You have to go,"" said the priest. ""Well, yes,"" said K., ""you need to understand that."" ""First, you need to understand who I am,"" said the priest. ""You're the prison chaplain,"" said K., and went closer to the priest, it was not so important for him to go straight back to the bank as he had made out, he could very well stay where he was. ""So that means I belong to the court,"" said the priest. ""So why would I want anything from you? the court doesn't want anything from you. It accepts you when you come and it lets you go when you leave."" Chapter Ten End The evening before K.'s thirty-first birthday - it was about nine o'clock in the evening, the time when the streets were quiet - two men came to where he lived. In frock coats, pale and fat, wearing top hats that looked like they could not be taken off their heads. After some brief formalities at the door of the flat when they first arrived, the same formalities were repeated at greater length at K.'s door. He had not been notified they would be coming, but K. sat in a chair near the door, dressed in black as they were, and slowly put on new gloves which stretched tightly over his fingers and behaved as if he were expecting visitors. He immediately stood up and looked at the gentlemen inquisitively. ""You've come for me then, have you?"" he asked. The gentlemen nodded, one of them indicated the other with the top hand now in his hand. K. told them he had been expecting a different visitor. He went to the window and looked once more down at the dark street. Most of the windows on the other side of the street were also dark already, many of them had the curtains closed. In one of the windows on the same floor where there was a light on, two small children could be seen playing with each other inside a playpen, unable to move from where they were, reaching out for each other with their little hands. ""Some ancient, unimportant actors - that's what they've sent for me,"" said K. to himself, and looked round once again to confirm this to himself. ""They want to sort me out as cheaply as they can."" K. suddenly turned round to face the two men and asked, ""What theatre do you play in?"" ""Theatre?"" asked one of the gentlemen, turning to the",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,103,"other for assistance and pulling in the corners of his mouth. The other made a gesture like someone who was dumb, as if he were struggling with some organism causing him trouble. ""You're not properly prepared to answer questions,"" said K. and went to fetch his hat. As soon as they were on the stairs the gentlemen wanted to take K.'s arms, but K. said ""Wait till we're in the street, I'm not ill."" But they waited only until the front door before they took his arms in a way that K. had never experienced before. They kept their shoulders close behind his, did not turn their arms in but twisted them around the entire length of K.'s arms and took hold of his hands with a grasp that was formal, experienced and could not be resisted. K. was held stiff and upright between them, they formed now a single unit so that if any one of them had been knocked down all of them must have fallen. They formed a unit of the sort that normally can be formed only by matter that is lifeless. Whenever they passed under a lamp K. tried to see his companions more clearly, as far as was possible when they were pressed so close together, as in the dim light of his room this had been hardly possible. ""Maybe they're tenors,"" he thought as he saw their big double chins. The cleanliness of their faces disgusted him. He could see the hands that cleaned them, passing over the corners of their eyes, rubbing at their upper lips, scratching out the creases on those chins. When K. noticed that, he stopped, which meant the others had to stop too; they were at the edge of an open square, devoid of people but decorated with flower beds. ""Why did they send you, of all people!"" he cried out, more a shout than a question. The two gentleman clearly knew no answer to give, they waited, their free arms hanging down, like nurses when the patient needs to rest. ""I will go no further,"" said K. as if to see what would happen. The gentlemen did not need to make any answer, it was enough that they did not loosen their grip on K. and tried to move him on, but K. resisted them. ""I'll soon have no need of much strength, I'll use all of it now,"" he thought. He thought of the flies that tear their legs off struggling to get free of the flypaper. ""These gentleman will have some hard work to do"". Just then, Miss Brstner came up into the square in front of them from the steps leading from a small street at a lower level. It was not certain that it was her, although the similarity was, of course, great. But it did not matter to K. whether it was certainly her anyway, he just became suddenly aware that there was no point in his resistance. There would be nothing heroic about it if he resisted, if he now caused trouble for these gentlemen, if in defending himself he sought to enjoy his last glimmer of life. He started walking, which pleased the gentlemen and some of their pleasure conveyed itself to him. Now they permitted him to decided which direction they took, and he decided to take the direction that followed the young woman in front of them, not so much because he wanted to catch up with her, nor even because he wanted to keep her in sight for as long as possible, but only so that he would not forget the reproach she represented for him. ""The only thing I can do now,"" he said to himself, and his thought was confirmed by the equal length of his own steps with the steps of the two others, ""the only thing I can do now is keep my common sense and do what's needed right till the end. I always wanted to go at the world and try and do too much, and even to do it for something that was not too cheap. That was wrong of me. Should I now show them I learned nothing from facing trial for a year? Should I go out like someone stupid? Should I let anyone say, after I'm gone, that at the start of the proceedings I wanted to end them, and that now that they've ended I want to start them again? I don't want anyone to say that. I'm grateful they sent these unspeaking, uncomprehending men to go with me on this journey, and that it's been left up to me to say what's necessary"". Meanwhile, the young woman had turned off into a side street, but K. could do without her now and let his companions",no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,104,"lead him. All three of them now, in complete agreement, went over a bridge in the light of the moon, the two gentlemen were willing to yield to each little movement made by K. as he moved slightly towards the edge and directed the group in that direction as a single unit. The moonlight glittered and quivered in the water, which divided itself around a small island covered in a densely-piled mass of foliage and trees and bushes. Beneath them, now invisible, there were gravel paths with comfortable benches where K. had stretched himself out on many summer's days. ""I didn't actually want to stop here,"" he said to his companions, shamed by their compliance with his wishes. Behind K.'s back one of them seemed to quietly criticise the other for the misunderstanding about stopping, and then they went on. The went on up through several streets where policemen were walking or standing here and there; some in the distance and then some very close. One of them with a bushy moustache, his hand on the grip of his sword, seemed to have some purpose in approaching the group, which was hardly unsuspicious. The two gentlemen stopped, the policeman seemed about to open his mouth, and then K. drove his group forcefully forward. Several times he looked back cautiously to see if the policeman was following; but when they had a corner between themselves and the policeman K. began to run, and the two gentlemen, despite being seriously short of breath, had to run with him. In this way they quickly left the built up area and found themselves in the fields which, in this part of town, began almost without any transition zone. There was a quarry, empty and abandoned, near a building which was still like those in the city. Here the men stopped, perhaps because this had always been their destination or perhaps because they were too exhausted to run any further. Here they released their hold on K., who just waited in silence, and took their top hats off while they looked round the quarry and wiped the sweat off their brows with their handkerchiefs. The moonlight lay everywhere with the natural peace that is granted to no other light. After exchanging a few courtesies about who was to carry out the next tasks - the gentlemen did not seem to have been allocated specific functions - one of them went to K. and took his coat, his waistcoat, and finally his shirt off him. K. made an involuntary shiver, at which the gentleman gave him a gentle, reassuring tap on the back. Then he carefully folded the things up as if they would still be needed, even if not in the near future. He did not want to expose K. to the chilly night air without moving though, so he took him under the arm and walked up and down with him a little way while the other gentleman looked round the quarry for a suitable place. When he had found it he made a sign and the other gentleman escorted him there. It was near the rockface, there was a stone lying there that had broken loose. The gentlemen sat K. down on the ground, leant him against the stone and settled his head down on the top of it. Despite all the effort they went to, and despite all the co-operation shown by K., his demeanour seemed very forced and hard to believe. So one of the gentlemen asked the other to grant him a short time while he put K. in position by himself, but even that did nothing to make it better. In the end they left K. in a position that was far from the best of the ones they had tried so far. Then one of the gentlemen opened his frock coat and from a sheath hanging on a belt stretched across his waistcoat he withdrew a long, thin, double-edged butcher's knife which he held up in the light to test its sharpness. The repulsive courtesies began once again, one of them passed the knife over K. to the other, who then passed it back over K. to the first. K. now knew it would be his duty to take the knife as it passed from hand to hand above him and thrust it into himself. But he did not do it, instead he twisted his neck, which was still free, and looked around. He was not able to show his full worth, was not able to take all the work from the official bodies, he lacked the rest of the strength he needed and this final shortcoming was the fault of whoever had denied it to him. As he looked round, he saw the top floor of the",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Trial - Franz Kafka,105,"building next to the quarry. He saw how a light flickered on and the two halves of a window opened out, somebody, made weak and thin by the height and the distance, leant suddenly far out from it and stretched his arms out even further. Who was that? A friend? A good person? Somebody who was taking part? Somebody who wanted to help? Was he alone? Was it everyone? Would anyone help? Were there objections that had been forgotten? There must have been some. The logic cannot be refuted, but someone who wants to live will not resist it. Where was the judge he'd never seen? Where was the high court he had never reached? He raised both hands and spread out all his fingers. But the hands of one of the gentleman were laid on K.'s throat, while the other pushed the knife deep into his heart and twisted it there, twice. As his eyesight failed, K. saw the two gentlemen cheek by cheek, close in front of his face, watching the result. ""Like a dog!"" he said, it was as if the shame of it should outlive him.",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes

I was only born a fe w hours ago. But I know my last nam e is Button. Our story starts in the summer of I860, in the busy city of Baltimore. At that time, babies were usually born at home, not in hospitals. But young Mr. and Mrs. Roger Button had different ideas. They wanted their first baby to arrive in a hospital. Was this one of the reasons for the strange history that I am going to tell you? I can only describe what happened. Then you can decide. The Roger Buttons were important people in Baltimore society. They knew every good family in town, and everyone knew them. This was their first baby, so Mr. Button was naturally nervous. He was hoping for a boy so he could send him to Yale College in Connecticut. Mr. Roger Button was a student at Yale when he was a young man. Of course, he wanted his son to follow him there. The great day arrived. Mr. Button hurried to the hospital one morning in September for news of his wife and baby. When he was close to the Maryland Private Hospital, he saw the family doctor on the front steps. There was a serious look on the doctors face and this worried Mr. Button. He ran toward the doctor. Doctor Keene! he called. Oh, Doctor Keene! The doctor heard him, and turned around. He saw Mr.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

Talk sense! said the doctor, a little angrily. Is the child born? asked Mr. Button. Doctor Keene didnt answer immediately. Yes, he said slowly. A strange birth. Is my wife all right? Yes. Is it a boy or a girl? Go and see, replied Doctor Keene. He still seemed strangely angry. Terrible!

I brought you into the world, young man, and Ive looked after your family for forty years, but this is the end! I dont want to see you or any of your relatives ever again! Goodbye! And without another word, he turned and walked away. Mr. Button stood there on the sidewalk, feeling very worried and afraid. Something terrible has happened, he thought. Now, he didnt want to go into the hospital. But he walked slowly up the steps and through the entrance doors. A nurse was sitting behind a desk. Good morning, she said, smiling. Good morning. I I am Mr. Roger Button. A look of fear came over the girls face. She stood up, clearly planning to run away. Then she calmed herself and sat down again. I want to see my child, said Mr. Button. The nurse gave a little scream. Oh, of course! Upstairs! Go upstairs! she said quickly. She pointed to the stairs and Mr. Button turned away from the desk. He went upstairs and found another nurse. She was carrying a large metal bowl. Im Mr. Button, he began nervously. I want to see my ... Clank! The nurse dropped the bowl. It fell down the stairs, one step at a time, and landed with a loud noise at the bottom. I want to see my child! Mr. Button shouted. All right, Mr. Button, the nurse agreed in a quiet voice. All right. But its 2 Story 1 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Part 1) terrible! Were all feelingwell, nobody will want to use the hospital again after this ... Hurry! Mr. Button cried. I cant wait any longer. Come this w ay Mr. Button. Mr. Button followed the nurse. There was a sound of babies crying. This grew louder until they stopped outside a room. The nurse pushed the door open and they went in. Around the walls were white cribs, each one with a name tied to the top. Well, said Mr. Button, which is mine? There! said the nurse. Mr. Buttons eyes followed her pointing finger. And this is what he saw. An old man of about seventy years old sat in one of the cribs. His hair was almost white, and he had a long, gray beard. His feet hung over one end of the crib, and his head and arms hung over the other. He was wearing only a large, white blanket. He looked at Mr. Button with a question in his eyes. Am I crazy? Mr. Button shouted angrily at the nurse. Is this some terrible hospital joke? It doesnt seem like a joke to us, said the nurse angrily. And I dont know if youre crazy or not. But theres no mistake. That is your child. The old man looked calmly at the nurse, and then at Mr. Button. Are you my father? he asked. Because if you are, please get me out of this place. Its very uncomfortable. Where did you come from? Who are you? screamed Mr. Button. I cant say exactly who I am, the old man replied. I was only born a few hours ago. But I know my last name is Button. Youre lying! I dont believe you! The old man turned to the nurse. Thats a nice way to welcome a new-born baby, he said. Please tell him hes wrong. Youre wrong, Mr. Button, said the nurse coldly. This is your child and youll have to make the best of it. We want you to take him home as soon as possible. Some time today. Home? said Mr. Button. Take him home? Yes, we cant have him here. Ill be glad to get home, said the old man. I cant sleep because of",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes

W hat must I do? he said to himself quietly. Youll have to take him home, said the nurse. Immediately! Mr. Button suddenly imagined himself walking through the town with the old man at his side. W hat could he say to people? This is my son, born early this morning. He thought of those people looking in surprise at the old man next to him. The nurse was watching him impatiently. Dont sit there feeling sorry for yourself, she said. Im not going to walk home in this blanket, said the old man suddenly. Babies always have blankets, replied the nurse. Well, this babys not going to wear this blanket any longer. In a few minutes Im going to take it off. Keep it on! Keep it on! said Mr. Button, hurriedly. He turned to the nurse. W hat shall I do? Go down town and buy your son some clothes, the nurse told him. As Mr. Button left the room, his son called to him. And a hat, Father. I want a hat. Maybe I need some glasses, too. Mr. Button shut the door hard behind him, and all the babies started crying again. He went to the nearest clothes store. I want to buy some clothes for my son, he said to the salesclerk. How old is your child, sir? About six hours old, answered Mr. Button, without thinking. Babies clothes are at the back of the store. 4 Story 1 The Curious Case o f Benjamin Button (Part 1) I dont thinkhes an unusually large child. Very large. They have the largest babies sizes. Where are the boys clothes? asked Mr. Button. He felt nervous. He was sure that the salesclerk already knew his terrible secret. Boys clothes are right here. Mr. Button stopped and thought for a minute. He didnt like the idea of dressing his son in mens clothes. Maybe a very large boys suit? Then he could cut his sons beard off and color his hair brown. He looked around. But he couldnt see anything to fit the new-born Button. How old did you say your son was? asked the salesclerk curiously. Heshes sixteen. Im so sorry sir. I thought you said six hours. Youll find something for the young man in the next room. Mr. Button turned away Then he stopped and pointed his finger at a suit in the shop window. There! he said. Ill take that suit. The salesclerk looked at the suit in surprise. But thats for a child to wear to a party, sir. Its not for everyday wear, its a costume. Its what I want. The surprised salesclerk sold him the costume. Back at the hospital, Mr. Button almost threw the package at his son. Here are your clothes, he said. Put them on. The old man untied the package and looked at the suit. I dont want to look stupid, he said. I m the one who looks stupid, said Mr. Button angrily. Put them on or or Ill Ill hit you. That sounded strange. But wasnt it what fathers said to their sons? All right, Father. Youve lived longer than me, you know best. Ill do what you want. And hurry. Im hurrying, Father. When his son was dressed, Mr. Button looked at him unhappily. It wasnt good. The pants were pink, the socks were green, and the white shirt had a belt around the waist. Hanging down over the front of the shirt was his sons long, gray beard. W ait! he said. Mr. Button picked up a hospital knife and cut off most of the beard. But costum e /'kastum / (n) clothes th at are worn to a special kind of party. In these clothes you look like a fam ous person, an anim al, or som eone from a story. 5 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories even this didnt help much. The watery eyes, the yellow teeth ... You could see that this was an old man. But Mr. Button held out his hand. Come along! he said. His son took his hand and they walked together from the hospital.

They shaved his beard every day and they ordered very large baby suits for him. They wanted Benjamin to look like a baby, and they tried very hard. But the baby nurse took one look and left the house immediately. At first, on Mr. Buttons orders, his son was only given warm milk. But this didnt please Benjamin, so Mr. Button finally changed his mind. After that, Benjamin was given bread and butter and other soft food. Mr. Button brought home toys for babies, and Benjamin tried to play with them. But the toy trains and animals didnt interest him. Soon, he found other things in the house that he liked better. * M ethuselah: the oldest man in the Bible. He lived to the age of 969 years. 6 Story 1 -T h e Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Part 1) One day when Mr. Button came home, his cigarettes werent in their usual place. He looked everywhere. Later that evening, he walked into his sons bedroom. The room was full of smoke and Benjamin was trying to hide a cigarette. Mr. Button was angry He knew that he should punish his son. But he found that he couldnt hit him. You wont grow, he told Benjamin. Smoking is very bad for children. He continued to bring home toys, but Benjamin wasnt interested. When he was alone in the house, he often took books from the shelves downstairs. Then he read them all afternoon in his room. His toys stayed in a corner of the room, and he never played with them. Soon, everybody in Baltimore knew about Benjamin. Most people didnt know what to say to Mr. and Mrs. Button. He looks very much like his grandfather, some kind people said. This was of course true, but Mr. and Mrs. Button werent pleased and Benjamins grandfather was very angry. Small children were brought to the house to play with Benjamin. He tried to be interested in their games, but it wasnt easy for him. Their games were very simple baby games, and Benjamin wanted more difficult activities. One day, 7 The Curious Case o f Benjamin Button and Other Stories he broke a kitchen window with a stone when he was playing with some of the children. It was an accident but the boys were all afraid. But Mr. Button wasnt angry. Secretly, he was very pleased. Accidents happen when small boys are playing, he told his wife. You see, Benjamin is only a child, like every other small boy. After this success, Benjamin tried to break something every day, to please his parents. After a difficult start, Benjamin and his grandfather became very good friends. They sat together for hours, talking about news from the town or stories in the newspapers. Benjamin started to feel more comfortable with his grandfather than with his parents. Mr. and Mrs. Roger Button always seemed a little afraid of their son. They told him what to do. But they often called him Mr. Benjamin was as surprised as everyone by the age of his mind and body. He didnt understand it. He read books about medicine but he never found another case like his. Because Mr. Roger Button wanted him to play with other boys, Benjamin tried to do this. But he couldnt run with them and football was too hard for him. His body was too old. He was afraid of getting hurt. The other boys couldnt understand Benjamin. They didnt know his age. They thought he was an old man. It seemed strange to them to play games with him. When he was five, Benjamin was sent to kindergarten. There he learned to stick pieces of colored paper together. He made things from old boxes and he drew pictures. But he was bored kindergarten /'kin d^gartn/ (n) a school for young children 8 Story 1 - The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Part 1) and he often went to sleep in class. His teacher was worried by this. She wrote to his parents, and soon Benjamin was taken out of school. The Buttons explained this to their friends. We think hes still too young for school, they said. By the time he was twelve years old, his parents were used to him. Most of the time, they didnt think he was different from other children. Then, one day, Benjamin looked in the mirror and discovered something very surprising. M y hair, he thought. It was white under the brown color, but now it 9 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories looks gray. And my skin seems smoother and healthier.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),4,"be true? Is it possible ...? He went to his father. Im grown-up, he said. I want to wear long pants. His father thought about it. Well, he said finally, I dont know. Fourteen is the usual age for putting on long pants. Youre only twelve. But you must agree that Im big for my age, said Benjamin. Oh, Im not sure about that, said Mr. Button. I was as big as you when I was twelve. This wasnt true, but Mr. Button wanted to believe it. He wanted nothing more than an ordinary son. Finally, Benjamins parents agreed to his request. But you must continue coloring your hair, said Mr. Button. And you must try harder to play with boys of your own age. Yes, Father. And theres one more thing, Benjamin. You mustnt wear your glasses in the street. No, Father. Then I will buy you a suit with long pants, said Mr. Button. Benjamin was very happy The years passed. Benjamin became younger as he grew older. When he was eighteen, he looked like a man of fifty. He had more hair and it was dark gray. His voice was deeper and stronger. So, his father sent him to Connecticut to take the entrance tests for Yale College. Benjamin passed all the tests and became a freshman. Three days later, he received a letter from Mr. Hart, one of the professors. Please come to see me today, the letter said. We must discuss the times of your classes. Benjamin looked in the mirror. His hair needed more brown color, but he didnt have time to go to the store. He had to go to Mr. Hart as he was. Good morning, said Mr. Hart politely. Youve come to discuss your son. Well, my names Button ... began Benjamin. Im very glad to meet you, Mr. Button. Ive asked Benjamin to see me today. Hell probably be here soon. Thats me! said Benjamin quickly. Im a freshman. What? freshm an /'frejm an/ (n) a student in the first year of college 10 Story 1 -T h eC u rio u s CaseofBenjam in Button (Part 1) Im a freshman. You are joking, of course. No. Im Benjamin Button. Mr. Hart looked at the information on his desk. Mr. Benjamin Buttons age is, I believe, eighteen. Thats my age, said Benjamin. Mr. Hart looked at him. You surely dont think I believe that? Benjamin smiled. I am eighteen, he repeated. Mr. Hart pointed to the door. Get out, he said. Get out of this college and out of town. You are a crazy, dangerous man. Im eighteen. Mr. Hart opened the door. Thats terrible! he shouted. A man of your age trying to come here as a freshman! Eighteen years old, are you? Well, Ill give you eighteen minutes to get out of town. \ Benjamin walked slowly out of the room. Some students were waiting outside and they watched him curiously. Benjamin turned around and faced Mr. Hart again. I am eighteen years old, he repeated. The group of students laughed. Benjamin walked away. - Benjamin started to walk back to the railroad station. But the students outside Mr. Harts room were telling other students about the crazy man. Soon, everyone in Yale knew the story. Benjamin started to realize that people were following him. At first there were only two or three people. Then more joined the group. Soon, there were a lot of students behind him, and the college football team came, too. They were all laughing and shouting at Benjamin. He thought the college was an old peoples home! Hes a really good student for his age! Go to Harvard! Benjamin walked faster, and soon he was running. When he was safely on the train for Baltimore, he put his head out of the window. I w ill go to Harvard! he shouted at them. Youll be sorry for this one day! Ha-ha-ha! laughed the students. Benjamin learned an important lesson that day. Sometimes it was better not to be completely honest. But it was also the biggest mistake that Yale College ever made. 11 Look back at your answers to Activity 1.2 on page iv.

There was no question about it: he was still gettin g younger. In 1880, Benjamin Button was twenty years old. On his birthday, he started working for his father at Roger Button & Company In the same year, Benjamin began going out to social activities. His father wanted to take him out to dances in the town, and they spent many evenings together. Roger Button was now fifty, and he and his son were friends. Benjamin had stopped coloring his hair (it was still a little gray) and he and his father looked about the same age. People often thought they were brothers. One night in August, they dressed in their evening suits and drove out to a dance at the Shevlins country house, a few miles outside of Baltimore. It was a beautiful evening. The moon was a great, round ball in the sky. They drove through fields of flowering plants, green and silver and sweet-smelling in the warm night air. The sky above them was full of stars. But Benjamins father didnt seem to notice the wonderful evening. He was a practical man. Theres a great future for our business, Roger Button said. But old men like me cant learn new tricks. That great future is there for energetic young people like you. Far up the road, they saw the lights of the Shevlins country house, and soon they arrived at the front of the building. Benjamin looked out the window at other arriving guests. A lady and an older man waited at the front steps. Then another, very beautiful young lady joined them. Benjamin sat up straight. He suddenly felt different. His face became red, and there was an unusual noise in his ears. It was first love. The girls hair was silver under the moon, and a pale gold color under the gas lights. She was wearing a yellow and black dress, and her small, pretty feet were in gold dance shoes. Roger Button turned to his son. Thats young Hildegarde Moncrief, and her parents, he said quietly. A pretty little thing, said Benjamin, trying to sound uninterested. Then he added, Dad, maybe you could introduce me to her. They walked across the drive. Hildegarde Moncrief was now at the center of a group of people. energetic /jena-'c^etik/ (adj) able to do a lot w ithout g ettin g tired. An energetic person has a lot of energy. 14 Story 1 -T h e Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Part 2) Miss Moncrief, said Benjamin, after the introduction, will you be very kind and dance with me? Yes, she answered. Ill be happy to dance with you later this evening. Benjamin thanked her and, with difficulty, walked away. He seemed to be walking on air. Inside the house, Benjamin stood at the side of the room and hours seemed to pass. He watched with murderous eyes as the young men of Baltimore danced with Hildegarde Moncrief.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),6,"him, Hildegarde was the only girl in the room. He couldnt enjoy the evening until she danced with him. When his time came, he took her hand. They walked onto the dance floor. In that minute, he felt that now his life was beginning. Hildegarde looked up at him with bright blue eyes. You and your brother arrived here at the same time as us, didnt you? Benjamin didnt reply immediately. She thinks were brothers, he thought. Is it best to tell her now? But he remembered that day at Yale, and the lesson that he learned there. He decided not to say anything. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories If I tell her, she wont like me, he thought. And I want her to like me very much. Ill tell her later. Maybe. So he smiled, listened, and was very happy. I like men of your age, Hildegarde told him. Young boys are so silly. They tell me how much wine they drink at college. They talk about how much money they lose at cards. It all means nothing! Men of your age are more serious. And they understand women and enjoy their company. Benjamin suddenly wanted Hildegarde to marry him. It was difficult not to ask her there and then. Youre the best age, she continued. Fifty. Twenty-five is too young. Men of thirty work too much. At forty, men tell endless stories. Sixty is oh, sixty is too close to seventy. But fifty is perfect. I love fifty. As they danced, Benjamin wanted to be fifty more than anything in the world. Ive always said that, Hildegarde continued. Its better to marry a man of fifty. Hell look after his wife. If a woman marries a man of thirty, shell have to look after him ! For the rest of the evening, Benjamin was lost in his own world. Hildegarde gave him two more dances. They discovered that they agreed on all the important subjects of that time. He asked her to go driving with him on the following Sunday. Then they would discuss all these subjects more. Benjamin and his father drove home in the early morning, before the sun came up. Roger Button was talking about business again. It was his favorite subject. But Benjamin wasnt listening. ... so what do you think about that? Roger Button asked him. Love, replied Benjamin, quietly. Love? What do you mean? his father said. How will love solve the problem of our costs? Benjamin didnt understand, and Roger Button had to explain everything again. And then the sun suddenly came over the hill, and a beautiful new day began. Six months later, Benjamin and Miss Hildegarde Moncrief became engaged. Her father wasnt happy about this. He thought that Benjamin was too old for his daughter. The excited people of Baltimore society suddenly remembered the old man brought home from the hospital years ago. The subject was discussed in every home. Was Benjamin really Roger Buttons father? Or maybe Roger Buttons brother, freed from prison after forty years. And there were other e n gaged /in'geidjd/ (adj) W hen tw o people are engaged, they have agreed to marry. 16 Story 1 -T h e Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Part 2) storiessome too crazy for anyone to believe. Most people thought that Hildegarde was mad. W hy was she marrying a man of fifty when many young men in Baltimore wanted to marry her? Nobody understood Hildegarde. After a local newspaper called Benjamin the Mystery Man of Maryland, Mr. Roger Button took his sons birth records to the paper. This proves his age, he said, angrily. But no one believed it. You only had to look at Benjamin. Hildegarde believed none of the stories, not even the true one. It didnt matter to her if he was fifty. It didnt matter if he looked fifty. She wanted to marry Benjamin and nothing could change her mind. In 1880, they were married. Benjamin believed he was the happiest man alive. Between 1880 and 1895, the Buttons business did very well and made a lot of money. This was mostly because of Benjamins ideas. Roger Button did less and less work and he left the company in 1895. Baltimore soon forgot all the stories about Benjamin, and the young Buttons were popular in the town. Even Mr. Moncrief changed his mind about his daughters husband. When Benjamin paid for the printing and sale of Mr. Moncriefs war stories, Hildegardes father was a very happy man. In fifteen years, there were many changes to Benjamin himself. He had more energy. It pleased him to get up early. He enjoyed walking through the sunny streets each day to work. He worked very hard, and with great success. His fathers",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),7,"business made more money than ever, thanks to Benjamin. Then, as time passed, he was more interested in having fun. Benjamin was the first man in the city of Baltimore to buy a car. His friends saw his energy and good health, and they were surprised. He seems to grow younger every year, they said. Roger Button, now sixty-five, thought his son was a wonderful man. Benjamin was liked by everyone who met him. There was a problem, though. One thing in Benjamins life was less than perfect: he stopped loving his wife. By that time, Hildegarde was a woman of thirty-five, with a son, Roscoe, who was fourteen years old. When they were first married, Benjamin loved his wife completely. But, as the years passed, her beautiful gold-colored hair changed to an unexciting brown. Her blue eyes became less bright. She was different in other ways, too. She didnt want to go out. Fifteen years earlier, Hildegarde was always the one who said, Lets go out to this party, or that 17 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories dinner. Now the opposite was true. She went to social evenings with Benjamin, but she didnt really want to go. They went at his suggestion, and because he wanted to. Hildegarde was happy to stay at home. Benjamin grew unhappy with her. When the Spanish-American War began in 1898, he decided to become a soldier. He was a very good officer and his men liked him. He was brave, too. But his business needed him, so in 1901 he returned home. A noisy band met him at the station. They walked with him to his house, playing their music all the way. Baltimore was happy to welcome Benjamin home again. Hildegarde was waiting at the house to greet him. He kissed her, but his heart was heavy. After three years, her hair now had some gray in it. She was a woman of forty, but she looked older. In his room, Benjamin looked in the mirror. He compared his face with a photograph taken before the war. There was no question about it: he was still getting younger. He now looked like a man of thirty. Good God! he said to himself. Ive waited for this day, when my body age has reached my real age. I wanted to be able to say, Its finished. Now Im like other men. But I can see thats not going to happen. The future looked terrible, unbelievableand he was afraid. Hildegarde was waiting downstairs for him. She looked angry. Shes guessed, he thought. She knows whats happening to me. So at dinner he tried to talk to her about it. Everybody says I look younger than ever, he started. Hildegarde didnt smile. Thats nothing to be proud of, she replied. Im not proud of it, he replied. You should stop it, she added. How can I? Im not going to discuss it with you, said Hildegarde. But theres a right way of doing things and a wrong way. If youve decided to be different from other people, I cant stop you. But I dont think its fair. But Hildegarde, I cant stop it, said Benjamin. Yes you can. Youre being difficult. Im glad that other people dont think like you. There was no answer to this. But from that day, life with Hildegarde became less and less comfortable. Soon, they were like 18 Story 1 -T h e Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Part 2) two strangers living in the same house. Benjamin found that he wanted to go to more and more social evenings. This made things worse at home. He was invited to every party, every dinner, and every dance in town, and he went to all of them. He danced with the prettiest young married women, and talked to the smartest girls. Sometimes his wife went with him. She sat with other older women and watched him, sadly, without understanding. Look! people said. The poor young man, tied to a woman of forty-five. He must be twenty years younger than his wife. They didnt remember that, back in 1880, their parents were saying almost the same thingbut the other way around. As Benjamin became unhappier at home, he found many new interests. He started to play tennis and made a great success of it. He took dancing lessons in 1906 he learned The Boston and was excellent at this new dance. A few years later, he could dance the Castle W alk better than any other young man in town. 19 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories His social life was becoming more important than his business life. And after twenty-five years with Roger Button & Company, Benjamin decided to leave work. His son, Roscoe,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),8,"was home again after completing his studies at Harvard College. He was the right age to take Benjamins place in the family business. Roscoe was very interested in the business, too. Benjamin could remember feeling the same at one time. In fact, people often thought that Benjamin and his son were brothers. This pleased Benjamin, as he liked to look young. There was only one thing in his life that he didnt enjoy. He hated going out in Baltimore with Hildegarde. She was now almost fifty. When they were together, Benjamin felt stupid. She looked like his mother. One September day in 1910, Benjamin Button went to Harvard College as a freshman. He looked about twenty and he didnt tell them his correct age. He remembered that mistake from his short time at Yale. And he didnt say that his son was a student there, years before. He seemed a little older and wiser than the other, mostly eighteen-year-old freshmen. And he was excellent at football. In his first year, the Harvard team played against Yale. In that game, Benjamin played the best football that anyone could remember. Because of this, he was soon the best-known student at the college. But in his third year, he wasnt always on the team. He weighed less, and he seemed shorter than before. He wasn t playing as well as in his first year. He was really only chosen for the team to bring fear to the other side. In his final year, Benjamin didn t play on the team. He was much smaller and thinner. Some first year students thought that he, too, was a freshman. At the same time, his studies seemed more difficult. He felt that the other students in his class were older and much wiser than he was. Some of them spoke about St. Midass School. Many of the Harvard students came from St. Midas s. At this school they prepared young boys for college. Benjamin started to think about going there after his studies at Harvard. It was a good plan he would like to be with boys of his own size and with the same interests. In 1914, Benjamin returned to Baltimore from college. Hildegarde was now living in Italy, so he moved in with his son, Roscoe, and his wife. They tried to be welcominghe could see that. But it was clear that Roscoe didnt really want his father there. Roscoe, now a successful businessman, had an important position in Baltimore society that he wanted to protect. Benjamin understood this, but he felt a little sad. 20 Story 1 - The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Part 2) Benjamin was bored at home and he had no friends now in Baltimore. Old girlfriends from his dancing days werent interested in him. The tennis players, from before his time at Harvard, stayed away. They thought he was only a boy. There were only three or four fifteen-year-old boys living in the neighborhood, and he spent time with them. The idea of St. Midass School came to him again. He asked Roscoe about it one day. Id really like to go there, he said. Then go, replied Roscoe. He disliked the subject, and didnt want to discuss it with his father. I cant go alone, said Benjamin. Youll have to take me. I dont have time, Roscoe told him, angry and red-faced. In fact, you cant continue like this. You must stop, and and go back the other way. This isnt a joke now. Benjamin almost started crying. And another thing, Roscoe continued. When visitors are in the house, I want you to call me Unclenot Roscoe, but Uncle. Do you understand? It seems wrong for a boy of fifteen to call me by my first name. Wait, heres a better idea call me Uncle all the time. Then youll find it easier. Roscoe turned away from his father and walked out of the room. Benjamin went upstairs and looked at himself in the mirror. I havent shaved for three months, he thought, but theres still nothing there. Roscoe wanted him to wear glasses. He also suggested a beard to stick onto Benjamins face. It seemed for a time that the crazy days of his early life were starting again. But Benjamin cried and Roscoe didnt continue with the idea. Now, in his room, Benjamin opened a book of boys stories. But he only read a little because he was thinking of other things. American soldiers were fighting in the First World War in Europe and Benjamin wanted to join them. But he had to be sixteen to become a soldier, and he looked younger. His true age was fifty-seven, but that, of course, was too old. But the government wanted soldiers from the Spanish-American War to",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),9,"fight again. They wrote to all these men, and soon a letter arrived for Benjamin. It invited him to get a new uniform and to go to Camp Mosby in South Carolina. Benjamin hurried into town. Because he was so small, he couldnt buy the uniform ready-made. He needed one to be made to his size. The salesclerk in the store measured him. uniform /'jum afairm / (n) a special suit o f clothes fo r a job. Soldiers, police officers, and nurses all w ear uniform s. camp /kEemp/ (n) a place where soldiers stay for a short time, often in tents The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories Do you want to play soldiers, son? he said, smiling. Im not playing, replied Benjamin. This uniform must be correct. The man laughed at him, and Benjamin became angry. My names Button, and I live on Mount Vernon Place, he said. So you know I can pay for it. Well, said the man, I guess thats OK. I f you cant pay for it, your father can. A week later, Benjamins uniform arrived at the house. He said nothing to Roscoe about his plans, but one night in April he left the house and took the train to South Carolina. A taxi carried him and his suitcases to Camp Mosby. The soldier at the gate laughed at the boy who wanted to play soldiers. Get someone to take my suitcases! said Benjamin. And hurrywere at war, Soldier! Some other soldiers arrived to watch. Then an officer came along on his horse. He was a kind man. 22 Story 1 -T h e Curious Case o f Benjamin Button (Part 2) Whose little boy are you? he asked, with a smile in his eyes. Ill soon show you! said Benjamin angrily. Here! Read this! And he gave the officer his letter from the government. The officer read it. He was very surprised. Where did you get this? he asked. I got it from the government. You can check with them, Benjamin replied. The officer put the letter in his pocket. You come along with me, he said to Benjamin, looking strangely at him, and well talk about this. He turned and began walking his horse toward the office buildings. Benjamin followed behind him, on foot. Everyone thought that the letter really belonged to Benjamins father. Nobody believed Benjamins story. Two days later, Roscoe arrived from Baltimore and took Benjamin back home. Benjamin left in tears, without his uniform. In 1920, Roscoe Buttons first child was born. It was a happy time. But there was one thing that nobody talked about. The babys grandfather was a small ten-year-old who played around the house. He was a little boy who loved his toy soldiers. No one disliked the little boy. He had a fresh, happy face, with eyes that were sometimes a little sad. But Roscoe Button wasnt happy about having Benjamin in his home. It wasnt right for a man of sixty to look fifty years younger. Like Hildegarde, many years before, Roscoe didnt think it was fair. Its good for older people to stay young, he said. But this is too much. Five years later, Roscoes little boy was old enough to play games with little Benjamin. There was a nurse to look after the two children. Roscoe took them both to kindergarten on the same day. Here, Benjamin discovered how much he enjoyed playing with little pieces of colored paper. He 23 The Curious Case o f Benjamin Button and Other Stories also made things from old boxes and he drew pictures. But this time, he didnt hate these activities and he wasnt bored. Once he was bad, and had to stand in the corner, and he cried. But most days were happy. He loved the time that he spent there. His teacher, Miss Bailey was kind to him, and he loved her, too. Roscoes son moved into the next class after a year, but Benjamin happily stayed in the kindergarten. Sometimes, other children talked about their hopes for their futures. Benjamin never joined in these conversations, and his little face became sad. Maybe he realized that his future was different. In his third year of kindergarten, Benjamin was too little to understand much. He didnt know what to do with the pieces of colored paper. He cried because the other boys were bigger. He was afraid of them. The teacher talked to him, but he didnt understand her. He was taken out of the kindergarten. His nurse, Nana, became the center of his little world. On bright days, they walked to the park. Dog, Nana taught him. Cat. Dog, Benjamin repeated happily. Cat. 24 Story 1 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Part 2) Sometimes Benjamin jumped",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),10,"on his bed, and this was fun. He jumped until he was tired. Sometimes he took a stick from the yard and went around the house with it. He hit the chairs and tables and shouted, Fight, fight, fight! When there were visitors, the older ladies always wanted to talk to him. The young ones tried to kiss him. He was a good boy and he held up his face to them, but this bored him. And when the long day ended, at five oclock, he went upstairs with Nana. There, she fed him m ilk and nice, soft food from a spoon. There were no memories in his childs sleep. Benjamin didnt remember his brave college days, or the many beautiful girls from his past. There were only the white, safe walls of his crib and Nana, and a man who visited him sometimes. When the sun went down, his eyes were sleepy. There were no dreams in his head, and nothing to worry him. The past wasnt in his head now. He didnt remember his days as a soldier, or the first years of his marriage. He forgot about Hildegarde, and his work at the family business. He had no memory of talking with his grandfather, into the night, in Roger Buttons family home. He didnt remember clearly if the milk was warm or cold at the last feed. There was only the crib, and Nana. And then he remembered nothing at all. When he was hungry, he cried. There were sounds and smells, light and dark, and nothing more. Then it was all dark. The crib, the faces above him, and the sweet smell of milk disappeared completely from his mind. 25 Activities 3 mm Were you right? Look back at your answers to Activity 2.4.1.

Only the Happer house had the full sun. It looked straight onto the",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),11,"street at the front. This was in the city of Tarleton in the far south of Georgia. It was a September afternoon in 1919. Up in her bedroom, nineteen-year-old Sally Carrol Happer sat at the window and looked down at the street. She felt hot, lazy, and sleepy. She watched Clark Darrows old Ford turn the corner. Clark had the car windows open, but she could almost feel the heat inside it. He drove across the road and stopped in front of the Happer house. The old car made a loud noise, like a cough, then it was silent. Clark called her name out of the window. Sally Carrol looked down sleepily. Clark was still sitting in the car. After a minute or two, he called again. Good morning, she said. Clark turned his tall body around and moved his head. He looked up at the window. Its not morning, Sally Carrol. Isnt it? she said lazily. W hat are you doing? Eating an apple. Im going swimming do you want to come? Sally Carrol thought about this. OK, she said, slowly Then hurry, said Clark. Sally Carrol stood up and walked to her mirror. She looked at herself, then put a sunhat on her head. It covered most of her short fair hair, except for the front. She looked again and moved the hat a little. Then she left the room. A minute later, she opened the car door. How are you, Clark? she asked. Fine, Sally Carrol. Where are we going? Out to Walleys Pool. Were calling for Marylyn and Joe Ewing on the way. Clark was tall and dark. His eyes were large and he had a nice smile. Clark knew this, and smiled often. He finished his studies at Georgia College in 1917, but he didnt work. His parents gave him enough money to put gas in the car 28 Story 2 The Ice Palace (Part 1) and have some fun. Tarleton was a lazy town. Clark spent his time talking about work but not doing any. Clark knew a lot of girls in the town from his school days. They were growing up beautifully and they all liked Clark very much. The best of them all was Sally Carrol. When the girls were busy, Clark spent time with other young men. They played tennis or football, talked, and drank together. Sometimes one of the boys left town and went up to New York, Philadelphia, or Pittsburgh. They left Tarleton to go into business. But most of the boys stayed in town. Clarks car coughed again, and moved off down the road. They drove along Valley Street, past the big expensive houses of the town. Then they came to Main Street and Tarletons stores. The town was busy and a lot of people were walking around. Clark slowed down behind some other cars. A local farmer and his sheep were in the road. Nobody was in a hurryit was too hot. The doors to the stores were open onto the street to keep customers comfortable. But this didnt help because the air wasnt moving much. Sally Carrol, said Clark suddenly, is it true that youre engaged? She looked at him quickly. Where did you hear that? Tell me are you engaged? I heard that you met a Yankee* in Asheville last summer. Everyone in this town tells stories about other people, said Sally Carrol. Dont marry a Yankee, Sally Carrol. We need you around here. Sally Carrol was silent for a minute. Clark, she asked suddenly, then who shall I marry? You could choose me. * Yankee: a name for a person from the north of the United States 29 The Curious Case o f Benjamin Button and Other Stories You dont have enough money for a wife, she said, smiling. And I know you too well to fall in love with you. Thats not a good reason to marry a Yankee. But maybe I love him. Clark shook his head. You cant. Yankees are too different from us, in every way. He stopped the car in front of an old house. Marylyn Wade and Joe Ewing were waiting at the door. They climbed into the car, and Clark started driving again. Sally Carrol, Marylyn asked immediately, are you engaged? Where did this story start? Maybe I did meet a man. But now everybody in town thinks were engaged. Clark kept his eyes on the road. When he spoke again, he sounded sad. Sally Carrol, dont you like us? he asked. What? Us down here? Clark, you know I do. I love all you boys. Then why are you getting engaged to a Yankee? Clark, I dont know. Im not sure what Ill do, but ... Well, I want to go to places and see people.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

I love you, and Joe here, and Ben Arrot, and all of you but ... youll ... youll ... Well all fail? Yes, but I dont mean only with money. Youll fail because you like Tarleton too much. Youll never want to change things or do more. She reached over and took Clarks hand. Clark, I dont want you to change. Youre sweet the way you are. I love everything about you. I even love the reasons why youll fail. But youre going away? Yes, because I cant ever marry you. You have a place in my heart that no other boy will ever have. But I cant rest, tied down here. There are two sides to me, you see. Theres the sleepy side that you love. But theres an energy, too. That s the feeling that makes me wild. Maybe I can use that energy somewhere when I stop being beautiful. But not here. Everybody was silent. Sally Carrol closed her eyes and put her head back. They were in the country now. The car hurried along, between green fields and under the shadows of tall trees. They passed lazy cotton-fields with families working under the sun. And everywhere there was the same heat. Sally Carrol, were here! Shes gone to sleep. 30 Story 2 The Ice Palace (Part 1) Water, Sally Carrol! Wonderful cold water waiting for you! Her eyes opened sleepily. H i! she said, smiling. In November, Harry Bellamytall, handsome, and full of energy came down from his northern city. He planned to stay for four days in Tarleton. He wanted to ask Sally Carrol to marry him. It didnt take four days for him to ask her. It only took one afternoon and one evening. Harry Bellamy had everything she wanted. And she loved him. On his last afternoon they walked, and she took him to one of her favorite places, the church yard. They stopped by the gate, under the late sun. Do you mind going in here? she asked. Some people dont like it, but I do. They passed through the gate and followed a path through the graves. Some had very big stones, with names and dates on them. They saw one or two people next to a grave, putting flowers on the earth. But most of the church yard was empty and silent. They reached the top of the hill and Sally Carrol stopped at a grave. Margery Lee, she read. 1844 to 1873. She died when she was twenty-nine. Dear Margery Lee. She put her hand in Harry Bellamys. I can see her, she said. I think she had dark hair. She wore wide skirts in blue cotton or rose pink. Can you see her, Harry? Yes, I think I can. Oh, I imagine that she was sweet, Harry. A lot of Tarleton men went away to war. They probably wanted to come back to her. But none did. They stood together and looked down at Margery Lees grave. Harry looked more carefully at the stone, but there was no record of a marriage. Then Sally Carrol pointed down the grave /greiv/ (n) the final resting place, in the ground, for a dead body 31 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories other side of the hill. Those are the graves of local Confederate* boys killed in the war, Harry. Some of them dont have a name, just the date. Nobody knows who they were. She looked up at Harry with tears in her eyes. I want you to understand how real this is for me. They died for us, for the South. Hand in hand, they turned and walked slowly away. Then they sat on the grass with their backs against an old wall and they kissed. Youll come up in the middle of January, Harry said as they walked slowly home. You have to stay for a month or more. Theres a winter carnival, and therell be a lot of snow. Youve never seen snow, have you? Itll be great fun. Youll love it. W ill I be cold, Harry? she asked suddenly. No! he laughed. Your nose, maybe, but you wont really feel the cold. Its dry, you know. I think Im a summer child. I dont like the cold. Sally Carrol, he said, slowly, what do you say to a wedding in March? I say I love you. March? March, Harry. All night in the train, it was very cold. Sally Carrol tried to sleep but it was freezing. She asked for another blanket but couldnt get one. Everyone on the train was cold and there were no more blankets. At six oclock she went to get",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no

She felt colder as she thought about the people inside. She saw their poor animals out in the fields. But as she left the dining car, she had a sudden feeling of great energy. This was the Northher land now! Everything was different and new. Sally Carrol wanted to see and do as much as possible. Soon, the view from the train changed. There were more houses, then she saw a bus. Then streets, more streetsthe city! * Confederate: soldiers from the south of the United States.

There she is! Oh, Sally Carrol! Sally Carrol dropped her bag. Harry kissed her. His face was icy-cold. He introduced her to the other people and she shook hands. First there was Gordon, Harrys brother, a short man of about thirty. Then there was Myra, Gordons wife. Someone put Sally Carrol s bag into a taxi, and they drove away from the station. In the snowy streets Sally Carrol saw small boys playing games in the snow. Oh, she cried. I want to do that! Can we, Harry? Thats for kids ... but maybe ... It looks fun, she said. Harrys home was a large, old house sitting on a blanket of snow. There she met his father, a big man with gray hair. Sally Carrol liked him immediately. 33 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories His mother was shaped like an egg. She kissed Sally Carrol, but there was something cold about her. Then everybody started talking at the same time. Would you like a drink? Or something to eat? Let me show you your room. Ill take your bags. Sally Carrol started conversations with everybody, but didnt finish any of them. There was too much happening in the house. After about an hour, she and Harry were finally alone. They sat together in the library. There were plenty of books on the shelves. But most, she guessed, were never opened. The room was large and the furniture looked expensive. It wasnt very comfortable. Sally Carrol thought of the library in her parents house. The books there were old and read many times. The sofa was comfortable, somewhere to sit and dream. It was all very different here. I hope they like me, she said. Of course they do! I m happy, so theyre happy, said Harry. 3 4 Story 2 - The Ice Palace (Part 1) Sally Carrol wasnt sure about Mrs Bellamy. But she didnt say any more to Harry. W hat do you think of it up here? asked Harry. Is it what you thought? Does it surprise you? Do you like it? Sally Carrol reached out her arms and kissed him. I like you, Harry, she said, smiling. The town, I mean. W hat do you think of the town? Can you feel the energy? Oh Harry, she laughed. Youll have to give me time. I only just arrived. She became quiet. One thing I want to say to you, said Harry. Down in the South you re very proud of your families, and that s good. But you 11 find that things are different here. Youll notice some things that will seem strange. You see, our grandfathers started this town. They were ordinary men doing ordinary jobs in those days. So they did some strange jobs before they became rich. For example, theres a very rich old lady here. You 11 probably meet her society. Well, her father picked up the trash in town. she s well-known in Harry! said Sally Carrol, surprised. Do you think that matters to me? I dont say bad things about people. Of course it doesnt matter, said Harry. But ... well, a girl from the South came up here last summer. She said some things that people didnt like. It was only because she didnt understand us. Sally Carrol felt a little angry but she didnt say anything. Harry didnt see the look on her face and continued happily. Its carnival time, he said suddenly, the first carnival in ten years. And theyre building an ice palace. Its made of clear ice and its very, very big. Sally Carrol stood up and walked to the window. Oh, she said.

Youll have to help me. Ill help you, he said softly. But you must tell me that youre happy here. And happy with me. Oh yes, Im happy, she said. Youre here, so this is home for me, Harry.

Harry was right. It was beautiful. The ice walls w ere almost clear and the lights shone on them. That night, at the dinner party, Sally Carrol felt uncomfortable. Most of the men did the talking, and the girls sat and looked pretty. Harry told her about some of the other guests. Theyre a good-looking crowd, arent they? Thats Spud Hubbardwe were students together. And thats Junie Mortonhe was the best football player at Yale. Some of the best sportsmen in the country come from around here. This is a mans country, you know ... She turned suddenly to a voice on her right. I guess they forgot to introduce us. My names Roger Patton. Im Sally Carrol Happer, she replied. Yes, I know. Harrys told me all about you. Are you a relative? No, Im a professor, at the college. Youre from the South, arent you? Yes, she said proudly. Tarleton, Georgia. She liked him immediately. He had a red-brown mustache and pale blue eyes. They spoke a little during dinner. She liked the idea of seeing him again. After coffee, Harry introduced her to many good-looking young men. Some of them danced with her and talked about nothing except Harry. They were very different to the boys that she knew in the South. There, they joked and had fun with all the girls, engaged or not. Here, they were polite but a little cold. She was happy when Roger Patton found her again. He suggested that they should sit down. So, he asked, hows the lady from the South? Im fine.

I saw you look out of the window a minute ago. You shivered. Oh, it was nothing, laughed Sally Carrol. Sometimes I look out and see the snow in the wind. I think that the dead are moving out there. Its silly, I know. Have you ever been north before? shiver /'Jiva*/ (v) to shake a little, because you are cold or afraid 38 Story 2 - The Ice Palace (Part 2) Only two days in Asheville, North Carolina. They watched the dancers. Theyre a nice-looking crowd, arent they? said Roger. Sally Carrol was surprised. Harry said that, too. Yes, they are. But I think theyre becoming frozen, Roger continued. Like all people in cold countries with long winters, they become sad and narrow-mindedthey lose the possibility of great happiness. There are a lot of people here from Sweden. Its because the weather is so similar, I guess. Did you know that more Scandinavians kill themselves than any other people in the world? So why do you stay here? It doesnt worry me. I think thats because books are more important to me than people. But theres something that I want to say to you. You re marrying a very fine man. I know. I need someone to look after me. Im sure he will. So you know why youre marrying. Thats good. Most girls don t. They see too many happy endings in movies. They think real life is the same. Sally Carrol laughed. Shall we dance? said Roger. She decided that he could become a real friend. Two hours later, on the way home, Sally Carrol sat in Harrys arms in the back of the car. Oh, Harry, its so cold, she said. Listen to that wind! But its warm in here, said Harry. She shivered again as his cold mouth kissed the top of her ear. The first week of Sally Carrols visit went very quickly. The January days were short and cold. Dark mornings and evenings were new to her. There was some pale yellow sunshine in the afternoons, but it soon disappeared. The Georgia sunshine was nothing like this. Sally Carrol tried some winter sports for the first time. She wasnt very good at them, and she often fell over on the snow and ice. She enjoyed some sports, but they were all quite difficult for her. Sometimes, small children stopped to help her. They were surprised that an adult was having difficulty. But Sally Carrol tried hard and she had fun. They were new activities and they were different. I wanted new people and new things, she thought, and now I have them. M y friends in Georgia will be surprised! But she soon realized that these activities were for children. The adults around her organized them for her, to make her happy. 39 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories At first, the Bellamy family seemed strange to her. She liked the men, and H arrys father was her favorite. She found that he was born in Kentucky. This made him special to her a bridge between the old life and the new. But she didnt like the Bellamy women. Myra, her future sister-in-law, was very pretty but had no interesting conversation. She was completely different to any of the girls back home. If these women arent beautiful, Sally Carrol thought, theyre nothing. They dont do anything. They have nothing to say. Men are the center of every mixed group. And there was Mrs. Bellamy, Harrys mother. Sally Carrol hated her. It was clear that Mrs. Bellamy didnt like strangers. She called Sally Carrol Sally. She didnt believe that she really had a double name. I feel like half a person, Sally Carrol thought. She soon realized that Mrs. Bellamy didnt like her hair. She didnt like her clothes, either. I dont think Mrs Bellamy likes anything about me, she thought. She met a lot of men in town, but she liked Roger Patton best of all. He was often a visitor to the Bellamy house. They talked about books and poems. They found that they liked the same writers. One day, Sally Carrol and Harry were walking home through the snowy streets. They passed a little girl, in a gray wool coat. 40 Story 2 - The Ice Palace (Part 2) Look, Harry! said Sally Carrol. That little girl. Did you see her face? It was as red as an apple! She looked so sweet. Your face is almost as red as hers, said Harry. Everybodys healthy here its this wonderful weather. Were out in the cold as soon as we can walk. Sally Carrol had",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),16,"to agree. Harry and his brother were very healthy. Suddenly, they saw a poor man at the corner of the street. His dirty old clothes didnt fit him well. He was cold and shivering. Hes probably from the South, said Harry. Look at those old pants! Harry, thats not fair, said Sally Carrol. Im sorry, but theyve lived too long down there. Its made them lazy. Sally Carrol was angry. If theyre lazy, it s because of the heat. Some men from the South are the finest in the world. And theyre my best friends. Please dont talk like that. Oh, I know. Some are OK. There was one in my class at college. Theyre all right when they come north to college. Nobody from the South talks the way youre talking now. But you said that you didnt want to marry a man from the South, said Harry. Thats different. I didnt want to tie myself to a boy from Tarleton. I didnt make any general statements like that. They walked in silence. Im sorry, Sally Carrol. Maybe I said too much, said Harry, as they reached home. Sally Carrol said nothing, but then suddenly she threw her arms around him. Oh, Harry, lets get married next week. These disagreements wont happen after were married. Thats silly. We decided on March, he said. Yes, of course. Im sorry. I guess it was a stupid idea, said Sally Carrol, quietly. Harry took her hand. Come and kiss me, and lets forget about it, he said. They kissed, but Sally Carrol didnt forget. It was a very cold night, after a day that was only a little warmer. But now there was snow on the streets again and the wind was coming from the north. The sky was completely gray. Sally Carrol and Harry drove through the silent streets. There were lights in all the houses. But Sally Carrol sometimes felt there was nobody living there. This is a sad, lonely place, she thought. 41 The Curious Case o f Benjamin Button and Other Stories She thought again of the country houses outside the city. She pictured the people inside. In her mind they were looking outside. They were waiting for the snow to go. They were waiting all winter for spring to arrive. She knew that spring in the North came slowly. It was still cold, and wet when the snow cleared. It was nothing like the sunny, flower-filled spring days of the South. If I die in this place, she thought, therell be snow on my grave all winter. Ill have to lie under a great blanket of it. The thought made her sad. She wanted her grave washed with sun and rain and the warm, sweet days of the South. Slowly, a storm arrived. There was more snow and the wind grew stronger. They continued driving through the snow. After another ten minutes, they turned a corner and there it was! The ice palace stood on a tall hill. It was three floors high, with a lot of narrow windows. Electric lights inside the palace shone out over the snow. Its beautiful! said Harry. They havent had a palace here since eighty- five! Sally Carrol felt sadder when he said that. This palace of ice was surely filled with the shadows of dead people from the eighties. She pictured their pale faces and snow-filled hair, and she shivered. Harry took her hand and they started to walk toward the palace. Another group of people arrived Gordon and Myra, Roger Patton, and another girl. 42 Story 2 - The Ice Palace (Part 2) There were a lot of people there already, dressed in warm coats and hats. They called to other people and talked together as they walked. Its a hundred and seventy feet tall, Harry told someone. Sally Carrol heard other people discussing the palace. Theres one main room, someone said. The walls are twenty to forty inches thick, another man said. It seemed everyone knew about the palace. They went inside and found seats. Sally Carrol looked around. Harry was right. It was beautiful. The ice walls were almost clear and the lights shone on them. Look! cried Harry. A band in the corner started to play. And then the lights went out. The music grew softer and then stopped. From outside came the sound of men singing. It came nearer. Suddenly, lines of men walked into the main room, carrying lights. The first line wore gray hats and each man had a gray blanket over his shoulders. As their singing continued, more men arrived, this time in red blankets. Then another line of men with lights walked in. Their color was blue. The last group had white hats and blankets. The men in white are people",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),17,"that youve met at dances, Harry said quietly. The singing grew louder, their lights were brighter. It seemed that the room was on fire. The men gave a great shout! The electric lights came on again and the band started playing. The musicians walked toward the palace entrance and the lines of men followed. Soon, they were all outside the palace again. Lets go! shouted Harry. We want to see the underground rooms before they turn the lights off. Everybody stood up and moved at the same time. Some people went outside, 43 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories some went downstairs. Sally Carrol put her hand in Harrys and they followed a lot of people down to a long room. They couldnt stand up, it was so low. Suddenly, their hands were parted and Sally Carrol couldnt see Harry in the crowd. She looked around at the many exits from the room. She thought she saw him disappear through an opening on her right. She looked through to a long passage. Harry! she called. Follow me! he shouted back. Most of the other people in the room were already leaving. Sally Carrol followed the sound of Harrys voice, but she couldnt see him. Harry! she called again. Sally Carrol reached a turning-point in the passage. She didnt know which way to go. She listened carefully. Was that Harrys voice on her left? She went that way. Then she passed another turning point on her right. Harry! There was no answer. She started to run straight forward, but then an icy fear took hold of her. She turned quickly and ran back. She reached a turn. This is where I turn left, she thought. This will take me back to the long room. But it only took her to another long passage. At the end there was only darkness. She called again, but there was no reply. Her voice came back to her from the ice walls. She turned around again. There was another corner, and another passage. It was difficult to walk now because of the ice on the bottom of her boots. She had to be careful not to fall. She put her hands out to the wall. Harry! Still there was no answer. And then the lights went out and it was completely dark. Sally Carrol gave a small cry and fell onto the ice. She imagined the ice walls closing around her. She imagined them taking her life. But fear made her move again. She suddenly felt great energy in her body. She got up and started moving carefully along the passage. She held her hands in front of her in the darkness. passage /'pesid3/ (n) a long narrow area join ing tw o rooms 4 4 Story 2 The Ice Palace (Part 2) I must get out, she thought. Harry was probably outside by now. Maybe he thought she was with other people. Maybe he wasnt looking for her. Maybe nobody was. No one will know until tomorrow. If they dont find me for days, she thought, Ill freeze to death. I must keep moving until I find the right way. She reached her hand out for the wall. Forty inches thick, they saidforty inches! Oh, send somebody send somebody! she cried loudly. Her friends at home, Clark Darrow or Joe Ewingthey understood her. She couldnt stay here to die. Not in this ice palace in a freezing northern town. Not Sally Carrol. She was a happy girl! She loved the sun and the warm South. The ice and these other cold, northern thingsthey were foreign to her. This wasnt her land. She didnt belong here. Youre not crying, something said from the darkness. Youll never cry again. Your tears will freeze. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories Sally Carrol fell forward onto the ice. Oh, God! she cried. Minutes passed. She was becoming tired. She felt her eyes closing. Then someone seemed to sit near her and take her head in warm, soft hands. She looked up slowly. Its Margery Lee! she said softly. I was hoping to see you. Margery Lee looked exactly as Sally Carrol imagined her that day in the graveyard. She had wide, welcoming eyes and dark hair. Her hands held Sally Carrols head and smoothed her hair. She was wearing a rose pink skirt made of soft cotton. Sally Carrol rested her head on that skirt. Margery Lee, she said. She stopped worrying and felt safe again. Everything was all right. It was getting darker and darker. The minutes passed quickly, and then slowly. Suddenly, Sally Carrol heard a great noise above her. It was the sun, wasnt it? No, it was a light. It was more than one light. Then she saw",no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),18,"a face under the light and felt arms lifting her. Someone touched her face, someone put a blanket around her. Sally Carrol, Sally Carrol! It was Roger Patton, and two other faces that she didnt know. Child, child! Weve looked for you for more than two hours! Harrys half crazy with worry! Sally Carrol started to remember things: the singing, the lights, the music. She moved in Roger Pattons arms and gave a long, low cry. Oh, I want to get out of here! Im going back home. Take me home ... Her words became a scream. Harry heard the scream as he raced along the passage toward her. An icy hand took hold of his heart. He knew that it was the end. Im going home! Tomorrow! she cried. Tomorrow! Tomorrow! 4 6 Story 2 The Ice Palace (Part 2) Golden sunlight poured down, warming the house. The road at the front of the house was comfortably quiet in the heat. Two birds in the yard next door were making a noise. They flew around a tree until they found a place out of the sun. Then they became quieter. Down the street, a black fruit seller called out. It was an April afternoon, and the first hot day of spring. Sally Carrol Happer sat in her bedroom. She rested her head on her hands and looked out the window. She was watching a very old Ford as it turned the corner. It stopped outside the house, the car coughed, then it was silent. Sally Carrol made no sound. A minute later, she heard a voice calling her name. She smiled and lifted her head. Good morning. A head looked out the car window. Its not morning, Sally Carrol. Oh, isnt it? she said, smiling. Well, maybe youre right. W hat are you doing? Eating a green apple. Itll probably kill me. Clark moved his body a little more, so he could see her face. The waters warm, Sally Carrol.

My uncle w ill have telephone messages traveling all over this ocean by six thirty. This improbable story begins on an ocean that was a blue dream. It was below a sky as blue as the blue of childrens eyes. The sun danced across the tops of the waves and made a golden pool a mile out. It was the beginning of a",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),19,"beautiful evening. Between the Florida coast and the golden pool lay a white boat called the Narcissus. It wasnt moving, but was sitting silently on the waves. On the boat, a yellow-haired girl was lying on a sofa, reading a book. She was about nineteen, with a wide mouth and quick, gray eyes. In her hand was half an orange. As she read, she brought the orange to her mouth. Then she touched it with her tongue. She was lost in her book and didnt hear the sound of footsteps. 50 Story 3 - A rdita and the Pirate (Part 1) An older, gray-haired man stopped in front of the girl. He didnt look pleased. His shadow fell across her, but she didnt look up. She turned the page of her book and touched the orange to her mouth again. Ardita! said the gray-haired man. She didnt reply. Ardita! he said again. Ardita! She continued to read, and lifted the orange again. Oh, shut up, she said. Ardita, will you listen to me? Put it in writing. Please close that book for two minutes. And put that orange down while Im speaking to you. Oh, cant you leave me alone? Ardita, Ive just received a telephone message from the shore ... Telephone? Ardita said, showing a little interest for the first time. Yes, it was ... You mean you have a telephone on this boat, out here? she asked. Yes, and ... Well, isnt science wonderful! W ill you listen to me for a minute? Oh, OK, said Ardita, smoothing the page of her book. M y friend Mr. Moreland has called again. He wants me to bring you to shore for dinner tonight. His son Toby has come all the way from New York to meet you. Hes invited some other young people, too. For the last time, will you ...r No, said Ardita, I wont. I came along on this boat trip to go to Palm Beach. You knew that was my idea. I dont want to meet your friend, or his son, or the other young people. So either take me to Palm Beach or shut up and go away. Very well, young lady. But I know youre planning to meet a man who ... I know, said Ardita. Ive heard it all before. You dont like him. You want to protect me. So you go your way and Ill go mine. I d like nothing better. But as your uncle . . . Oh, go away! Ardita shouted. Do you want me to throw this book at you: Smack! The book flew through the air. It missed Arditas uncle and landed at his feet. He turned away and called for a small boat. Then he walked back to the sofa. Ardita was sitting there, with the orange at her tongue again, shore /fr:r/ (n) the place w here the land meets the sea. You go ashore w hen you go from a boat onto the land. 51 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories I am going ashore, he said, slowly. I will return at nine oclock tonight, and we will start back for New York. When we arrive, I shall hand you back to your aunt. And you will stay there. He stopped and looked at her. Suddenly, he was no longer angry. She was little more than a child, he thought. Ardita, he said, kindly. Im not stupid. I know men. Men like this one dont change until theyre very old. Maybe the man loves youthats possible. Hes loved many women and hell love many more. Its less than one month since he was seen with that terrible red-haired woman, Mimi Merril. He promised her the gold and silver ring that Catherine of Russia gave his mother. You know thisyou read the newspapers. Make a film, said Ardita. Its a good story for a movie. W ill you tell me why you want to marry him? Maybe because hes different to the stupid young men that I usually meet. Maybe because he has imagination and hes brave. And dont worry about the famous Russian ring. Hes going to give it to me at Palm Beach. And the red-haired woman? He hasnt seen her for six months, she said, angrily. Men do what I want them to do. Dont you know that by now? Is it the Russian ring that interests you? No it isnt. And you know that I never change my mind. So please go away. I refuse to go ashore. Do you hear? Very well, he said. Youre an impossible, selfish girl and ... Splush! The piece of orange hit him in the neck. A voice came from below. The boat is ready to take you ashore, Mr. Farnam. Mr.",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),20,"Farnam was too angry to speak. He turned and climbed down the ladder. The sun dropped slowly and silently toward the ocean. Suddenly, the sound of men singing came up from below. Ardita lifted her head and listened. It was a very strange song, one that she didnt know. 52 Story 3 - Ardita and the Pirate (Part 1) Potatoes and cheese, Pigs on their knees, Apples and socks, Fish on the rocks, Lazy weather! Send us some wind, Send us some wind, Send us some wind. Pull together! Ardita threw her book down and hurried to the side of the ship. Fifty feet away, she saw a small boat coming toward her. There were seven men in it. Six of them were black, and one white man was standing at the front of the boat. All were singing. Ardita watched them curiously. Then the white man lifted one hand and the music stopped. Greetings, Narcissus, he called. W hats all this noise? asked Ardita. By this time, the small boat was against the side of the Narcissus. One of the 53 The Curious Case o f Benjamin Button and Other Stories black men took hold of the ladder, and the white man climbed quickly up it. He stood in front of Ardita. The women and children are safe! he cried. The men are our prisoners! Ardita looked at him, unable to speak with excitement. He was a young man, and handsome. His hair was short and very black. His clothes were smart. This ship is now mine. he said. Who are you? she asked coldly. Are you mad, or is this a joke? Were pirates, and we have now taken this ship, he replied. Get off the boat, Ardita said. What? The young man seemed very surprised. Get off the boat! You heard me! He looked at her for a minute. No I wont, he said slowly. You can get off, if you want to. He went to the side of the ship and called to the men below. Immediately, the six black men climbed up the ladder and stood in front of him. They were all wearing dirty old blue uniforms. Each man was carrying a white bag. Step forward, Babe, the young man said, and the smallest man stepped in front of the others. Yes, sir! Go down below. Tie up everyone you find. And put those bags over there. Yes, sir! Babe turned to the other pirates and then they all went downstairs. Now, said the young man to Ardita, promise to keep your pretty little mouth shut for forty-eight hours. Then you can take our boat and go ashore. And if I dont? Then youre going to sail with us. The young man sat down on Arditas sofa and looked around. He noticed the book and the orange. Hm. Have you got a clear head? Ardita didnt reply. Because in five minutes you have to decide. Go or stay. He picked up the book and looked at it curiously. This is written in French are you French? No. W hats your name? T' rarnam. Farnam what? Ardita Farnam. pirate /'pairet/ (n) a sailor w ho attacks other ships. Then he steals from them . 54 Story 3 - Ardita and the Pirate (Part 1) Well, Ardita, dont stand there looking nervous. Come over here and sit down. Arditas hands were shaking a little. She walked across to the other sofa and sat opposite the young man. You cant get me off this boat, she said, and you cant take it anywhere. M y uncle will have telephone messages traveling all over this ocean by six thirty. The young man looked back at her, but said nothing. I dont mind, she continued. It isnt my boat. I dont mind sailing with you for an hour or two. You can borrow that book if you like. Then you can read it when the revenue men catch you. There will be plenty of time to read in prison. He laughed. This was planned a long time before I knew about this boat. One boat is as good as another. Who are you? asked Ardita suddenly. And what are you? Youve decided not to go ashore? I never even thought about it. Were called Curtis Carlyle and his Six Black Friends. We were musicians and singers until today. Now, were pirates and were running from the law. He waved a hand at the white bags. W hats in the bags? Ardita asked curiously. Well, lets call it sandFlorida sand. Ten minutes later, the Narcissus was sailing away from the coast. It went south through the warm evening, as the sun came down. Babe seemed to be Curtis Carlyles main assistant. He gave orders to the other pirates. One of",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),21,"them was busy with a can of paint. He painted over the name Narcissus on the front of the boat and wrote the new name, Hula Hula. Carlyle sat with Ardita, waiting for dinner. He lay back on the sofa and closed his eyes. Ardita looked at him carefully. Hes a romantic person, she thought, but less sure of himself than he seems. Hes not really like me. Theres something different about him. But he was the same as her in some ways. Like Ardita, Curtis Carlyle was selfish. She liked selfish people they were never boring and they always fell at her feet in the end. But this man seemed softer, even defenseless. She was interested in him, more interested than in herself. And that was unusual for Ardita. The night became darker and the stars came out. A pale moon smiled revenue men /'rev3,nu men/ (n) governm ent men w ho try to catch pirates 55 The Curious Case o f Benjamin Button and Other Stories down onto the ocean and dark clouds came across the sky. The shore slowly disappeared. Sometimes, one of the pirates lit a cigarette. The only other light came from the moon. There was no sound except for the waves. All around them was the smell of the salt water. Carlyle broke the silence. Lucky girl, he said. Ive always wanted to be rich and to buy all this. Better to be you, said Ardita. Im not really interested in money. It cant give you everything. And it cant change the person you are. Im not afraid of anything on earth. Money didnt give me that. Its how I am. Hm. I m afraid of som e things. Lets talk about you. W hat have you done? And how did you do it? she asked. W hy do you want to know? Are you going to write a movie about me? Tell me, she said. Lie to me by moonlight. Tell me a wonderful story. One of the men arrived and lit some lights. Then he prepared the table for dinner. They ate cold chicken, salad, and fruit. Carlyle began to talk, slowly at first. Then he saw her interest and continued more happily. Ardita ate very little as she watched his handsome young face. And it was a good story. I began life as a poor kid in a Tennessee town. We were so poor, we were the only white family on the street. My friends were all black kids. There was a black woman called Belle Pope Calhoun. She played the piano at parties for rich white children. I sat next to her piano for hours, listening to her. She taught me to play. By the time I was thirteen, I was playing music in little cafes around Nashville. Eight years later, I took six of my black friends with me and we became a band. These are the men that you see me with now. We had great success. We played in all the big theaters in New York, and suddenly we were rich. Carlyle stopped. He took a drink, then put his glass down. And then it all changed. I stopped enjoying that life. We were making moneylots of it. Sometimes we played for private parties at three thousand dollars a night. But these were in houses where I wasnt welcome during the day. I was only the paid musician. I thought about leaving the boys becoming a pianist without them. But I was sick of the theater life. I wanted to have a lot of money, but I wanted time for reading and playing. I wanted to be part of the society that I played for. So I needed to get rich, quickly. I put all of my money into a business idea. But the business failed and I lost everything. Then the war came. I became a soldier, but one of the officers knew me as a musician. After that, I spent the war playing in a band, for the soldiers. Carlyle lit a cigarette and lay back on the sofa. 56 Story 3 - Ardita and the Pirate (Part 1) And then, after the war, it all started again. The band came together again. We played for private dances, and some of the best Florida hotels wanted us, too. It was only a question of time then. Ardita looked at him and waited for him to continue. But he shook his head. No, he said. Im not going to tell you about it. Its the best part of my story. Im enjoying my life too much now. I want to keep it for myself a little longer. If I tell you, Ill lose some of the excitement. I want to remember that wonderful feeling when they",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),22,"suddenly realized. Realized what? asked Ardita. That I was more than a musician. From below came the sound of singing. Ardita listened, smiling. Her eyes closed. Carlyle was silent for a minute. He looked up at the stars in the warm night sky. This is what Im looking for, he said softly. I want something beautiful that comes suddenly, like a dream. Like the beautiful eyes of a girl. He turned to Ardita, but she was silent. 57 The Curious Case o f Benjamin Button and Other Stories You understand, dont you, Anita I mean, Ardita? But she didnt answer. She was asleep. Next day, Ardita sat as usual in her favorite seat, reading. At around noon, she reached the last page of her book and put it down next to her. She looked up and saw an island in the ocean. It was green with trees, and all around it was a white, sandy beach. At one end, she could see a tall, gray cliff. Carlyle was standing at the side of the ship, looking at the island. Ardita called across to him. Is this it? Is this where youre going? But Carlyle didnt know. He shouted to Babe. Oh, Babe, is this your island? Yes, sir! This is it! Carlyle joined Ardita. It looks interesting, doesnt it? he said. Yes, Ardita replied, but it doesnt look big enough for a hiding place. Are you still thinking of your uncles telephones? Do you think hell find us out here? Maybe youre hoping for that. No. Im with you now. Id like to see you escape. Carlyle laughed. Youre our Lady Luck. Well have to keep you with usfor now. cliff / k lif/ (n) a large area of rock w ith a very steep side, often next to water 58 Story 3 - Ardita and the Pirate (Part 1) Well, you cant ask me to swim back, she said. If you do, I shall write down your long, long story. Ill turn it into a book. Im very sorry I bored you last night, he replied. Oh you didnt only at the end. You were very angry, werent you? Only because you couldnt dance with those ladies. You were no more than a musician to them. Carlyle was angry, but Ardita laughed. Men usually want to talk about m e, she said, not themselves. And does every man say, I love you? Ardita laughed. All of life is moving toward, or away from, that one sentence I love you. Thats a very smart thing to say, said Carlyle. Much too smart for this time in the morning. Mornings the time for sleeping and swimming. And being careless. The island came closer, and the black musicians started to sing again. Oh, down, Oh down, M y Momma wants to show me the stars, Oh down, Oh down, Daddy says tomorrow! But Momma says today, Yes Momma says today! Ten minutes later, the ship reached the island. It went around in a wide circle to the northern point. Theres a trick somewhere, Ardita thought. He cant mean to stop under this cliff. They were now heading straight toward the rock. The cliff was over a hundred feet tall. Then Ardita saw where they were going. There was a break in the cliff, hidden from the ocean. It was a very narrow passage, just wide enough for the boat. They traveled slowly, on calm, clear water between high gray walls. Finally, the passage opened out into a wide lake. Around them were trees and flowers, and in front of them was a beach. Ardita laughed. Its a wonderful place to hide! she said. Its the kind of place that you read about, said Carlyle. W hats its name? Ardita asked Babe. No name, he replied, laughing. Just Island, thats all. A small boat was lowered onto the lake, and they went ashore. Come with me, said Carlyle as he jumped onto the sandy beach.

Ardita Farnam runs away with a bank robber! They walked south to another beautiful white beach. Ardita kicked off her shoes and walked into the warm water. Then they walked slowly back to the small boat. Babe already had lunch ready for them. He had a man on the cliff, looking out for other boats. But he was sure that nobody knew about the break in the cliffs or the island. This islands not on any maps, he said, smiling. Its too small. In the afternoon, they sat with their backs against the rocks on the highest part of the cliff. Carlyle told Ardita about his plans. The revenue men will be after me by now, he said. So well stay here for a few weeks. Then well travel south and go to Callao in Peru. How much money have you stolen? asked Ardita. Just under a million dollars, he said. And what will you do in Callao? Take a ship for India. I plan to go into Afghanistan. Ill buy a palace there. Then after about five years, Ill go to England. Ill sound strangely foreign and my past will be a mystery. But India first. They say that all the gold in the world goes back to India in the end. I find that very interesting. And I want to read. I want enough time to read every possible book. Ardita laughed. You can laugh. But I know exactly what I want. Do you? Oh, yes. W hat is it? A man. W hat do you mean? W hich man? Are you engaged? Not exactly. But I had a plan to meet him in Palm Beach. You changed all that when you arrived. Hes waiting there for me with a gold and silver ring. It belonged to Catherine of Russia. I liked him because he had imagination and strong opinions. And your family werent happy about this man? he asked. I only have a silly uncle and a sillier aunt. They were very unhappy. There was another woman in the story. But he gave her up immediately, for me. Ardita moved forward and looked over the cliff. The ocean was far below. Lets go swimming tonight, she said, by moonlight. Carlyle said nothing, but he smiled to himself. 62 Story 3 - A rdita and the Pirate (Part 2) Night came, turning everything blue and silver. They took the small boat into the lake and pulled it up onto the beach. Then they sat in the bright moonlight and watched the water. Are you happy? Carlyle asked. Im always happy near the ocean, said Ardita. You know, you and I are the same in some ways. We have a similar history. Two years ago, when I was eighteen and you were ... Twenty-five. ... well, we were both successful in ordinary ways. You were a successful musician. I was beautiful young woman joining society. But deep inside us, we wanted more than that. I didnt know what I wanted. I went from man to man and I became more and more unhappy. I wanted things now now now! I didnt want to wait. Ardita stood up suddenly. Wait a minute. Im going to try this wonderful-looking water. She ran forward, and then he heard her in the water. Her voice came back to him. I read everything I could find. I began to hate society. Come back, Ardita, he called to her. I will, in a minute. Listen, first. I enjoyed being terriblethat was all. I went to parties in beautiful but impossible costumes. I went around with the most exciting men in New York. I was a very bad, wild girl. 63 The Curious",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

Its wonderful. He swam a little, then they sat together again on the sand. My family was angry, she continued. They tried to find me a husband. And then, suddenly, I found something. I discovered that I was brave. I started to believe in myself. And that helped me through life. Men still came to me old men and young men. They all wanted to marry this proud, brave woman, but I didnt want any of them. I decided to live exactly as I liked. I wanted to die in my own way, too. Thats OK for you, said Carlyle. You can be brave if youre rich. Its different for me. You have to believe in yourself. But I also have hope, and you can have that, too. My hope always is that things w ill get better. She ran to the water again. Carlyle heard her laugh as she reached the warm lake. And then he knew he loved her. For the next three days, Ardita got up early. She started every morning with a swim. The black musicians left their work and watched her over the side of the ship. In the afternoons, she swam again or she sat with Carlyle on the cliff. There, they talked for hours. Sometimes, they went to the beach on the south of the island to watch the sun go down. Ardita didnt want this to end. She stopped thinking of it as a crazy, romantic adventure in the middle of her boring life. How can I go back to my old life, she thought, after this? How can I start making decisions again about my future? She began to hate the idea of Carlyle leaving the island. Take me with you, she said late one night. She was sitting on the grass with Carlyle. Across the other side of the lake, the musicians were playing their music. Id love to become a very rich Indian lady, she added. Carlyle looked at her quickly. You can, you know. She laughed. Are you asking me to marry you? Think of the newspaper stories! The society girl and the pirate! Ardita Farnam runs away with a bank robber! It wasnt a bank. W hat was it? W hy dont you tell me? 6 4 Story 3 - Ardita and the Pirate (Part 2) I dont want to take away your good opinion. M y good opinion of you? No, of yourself. Ardita looked up in surprise. Myself? I dont understand. W ere talking about you r crimes, she said. Not about me. Well, well see about that. But its better if you dont know, right now. She reached over and touched his hand. Dear Mr. Curtis Carlyle, she said softly, are you in love with me? Does it matter? Yes, she said, it does. Because I think Im in love with you. That must make your January total at least six, he suggested. Maybe I w ill ask you to come to India with me. W ill you? We can get married in Callao. But what will happen when the revenue men catch you? W hat will happen to me? I thought you werent afraid. Im not. But I wont throw my life away to prove it to one man. I love you, Ardita, he said quietly. Her face became serious. I love to be with you, she said, more than with any man Ive ever met. 65 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories And I like your looks and your dark hair. Youre brave, and I like that, too. I like all the things you do, Curtis Carlyle. But Im not old enough, or bored enough, to go with you. I think Ill go back. Ill marrythat other man. Across the silver lake, the musicians continued to play. Lets dance! cried Ardita. I cant sit here with this music playing. Carlyle took her hand and they walked out onto a wide area of hard sand. The music came across the lake to them. Ardita felt that she was in a dream. They danced under the moonlight and the stars, with the summer smells of flowers all around them. This is perfect, said Ardita, softly. Its a private dance, only for the very rich and the very beautiful, Carlyle said softly in her ear. I feel quite crazy, but wonderful! They both laughed, but then suddenly the music stopped. They saw one of 66 Story 3 - Ardita and the Pirate (Part 2) the men running around the lake. He came closer. 1 hey saw it was Babe. Theres a ship",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),25,"out there, he said, pointing. Its less than a mile away and its not moving. A ship? W hats it like? Carlyle asked, and Ardita saw his face change. He looked very worried. I dont know, sir. Are they sending a boat ashore? Carlyle asked. No sir. Well go up. They climbed the hill in silence, hand in hand. At the top, they looked carefully over the cliff. Carlyle gave a little cry. Its a revenue boat, he said. There were six-inch guns at the front and back. They know, he said. They know were here. How did they find us? Are you sure they know about the break in the cliff? Maybe they 11 just take a look at the island in the morning. They cant be sure were here. They wont see our ship from out there, Ardita said. Maybe they will, he said. He looked at his watch. Its almost two oclock now. Youre right that they wont do anything until morning. Maybe theyre waiting for another ship. Its possible. The hours passed and Ardita and Carlyle lay there, side by side. They were both silent, their heads in their hands, like dreaming children. Behind them, the musicians also waited. Just before five oclock, Babe came to Carlyle. There are guns on the Narcissus, sir, he said. We can fight. We only need a plan. But Carlyle laughed and shook his head. Thats a revenue boat, Babe. Look at the guns that they have! We cant fight them and win. You can hide those bags in the sand if you like. But the men will go all over the island. Theyll find them. Babe turned away silently. Hes the best friend Ive ever had, Carlyle said to Ardita. Youve given up? asked Ardita. I have to theyll catch me. Look! The color of the sky was growing lighter. On the revenue ship they could see a group of men looking toward the island. They were looking straight at the break in the cliff. Im so sorry, Ardita said, softly. There were tears in her eyes. Well go back to the boat, said Carlyle. Its better that way. 67 The Curious Case o f Benjamin Button and Other Stories They went down to the lake, and the small boat took them all back to the Narcissus. Ardita and Carlyle sat on the sofas and waited. Almost an hour later, the front of the revenue boat came into view. It was sailing slowly into the break in the cliff. Then it stopped, and the sailors put two small boats over the side. In one boat was an officer and six men in blue uniforms. In the other were four men in uniform. Two gray-haired men were sitting at the back of the boat. Ardita and Carlyle stood up at the same time and he moved toward her. Then he put his hand into his pocket and gave Ardita a small package. W hats this? she asked. She opened the paper and took out a gold and silver ring. I cant be completely sure. But look closely. I think thats your promised Russian ring, he said. But how ... where ... ? It came out of one of those bags. Let me explain. Curtis Carlyle and his Six Black Friends were playing in the tea-room of an expensive hotel in Palm Beach. In the middle of a song, they suddenly pulled out guns and pointed them at the crowd. I took this ring from a pretty woman with red hair. 68 Story 3 - Ardita and the Pirate (Part 2) Ardita smiled. So thats what you did! I knew you were brave! And you do believe in yourself. And then the sun came up and the sky was golden. The shadows on the ship disappeared into the corners. Ardita and Carlyle moved closer together and kissed. She smiled up at him. Are you happy? he asked. But it was clear from the look on her face. Ardita was happier than ever before. For another minute, life was wonderful. Then they heard the sound of a 69 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories small boat at the side of the Narcissus. The two gray-haired men came up the ladder first. An officer and two sailors followed behind them. Mr. Farnam looked at Ardita. So, he said, slowly. Ardita took her arms away from Carlyles neck. She looked at her uncle. So, he repeated angrily. So this is your romantic idea of life. You decided to run away with a pirate. W hat a stupid old man you are! she said quietly. Is that your best defense? No, she said. No, theres another thing. Ive used these words to end most of our conversations for the past few yearsShut",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( PDFDrive ),26,"up! She took one last look at the two old men, the officer, and the sailors. Then she turned and walked away. As soon as she left, her uncle started to laugh. The second old man laughed, too, then he turned to Carlyle. Well, Toby, he said, you crazy romantic boy. W hat have you learned? Is she the person you wanted? Carlyle smiled. Yes, of course. I was sure when I first heard about her. You received Babes message last night? We did, said Mr. Moreland. But we kept quite close to you all the time. We were a little worried about those strange black musicians. We dont know much about them. Carlyle laughed. Theyre good men, he said. They played their part perfectly. Ardita never guessed. Your father and I sat up all night, waiting, said Mr. Farnam. Youre welcome to her, my boy. Shes driven me crazy. Did you give her the Russian ring that my detective got from that Mimi woman? Yes, said Carlyle. Be quiet! Shes coming back! Ardita looked at the group of men. W hy does everybody look so pleased? she thought. W hat has happened here without me? Ardita, said Carlyle. He took a step toward her. She took a step toward him. Ardita, he repeated. I have to tell you now. M y story wasnt true. It came out of thin Florida air. My name isnt Carlyle. Its MorelandToby Moreland. She looked at him, unbelieving at first, then surprised, and then angry. 70 Story 3 - Ardita and the Pirate (Part 2) The three men waited. Mr. Moreland moved toward her. Mr. Farnam waited, worried. But Ardita suddenly smiled, then laughed. She went to young Moreland and looked up at him. Fler gray eyes were not at all angry. Promise me, she said, that you thought of this. I promise, he said. It was my idea completely. Ardita kissed him. You imagined all this! Thats wonderful! she said softly. I want you to lie to me as sweetly for the rest of my life. The singing of the black musicians started again. Then Ardita remembered something. W hat was in those bags? she asked. Florida sand, he answered. That was one of two true things that I told you. Maybe I can guess the other, she said, and she kissed him again. 71 Talk about it Work with another student. Think about the story of ""Ardita and the Pirate and have this conversation.

overcoat,0,"1 Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852) The Overcoat Translated by Constance Garnett Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852) was a Russian writer born in Ukraine and considered a founder of Russian realism, although elements of romanticism and the grotesque permeate his work. His most widely-read novels are Taras Bulba (1835), a historical romance, and Dead Souls (1842), a satirical novel critical of the Tsarist regime. The Overcoat, also known as The Cloak, was published in 1842. Fyodor Dostoyevsky is supposed to have said that all modern literature has come out of Gogols overcoat. In the department ofbut it is better not to mention the department. There is nothing more irritable than departments, regiments, courts of justice, and, in a word, every branch of public service. Each individual attached to them nowadays thinks all society insulted in his person. Quite recently a complaint was received from a justice of the peace, in which he plainly demonstrated that all the imperial institutions were going to the dogs, and that the Czar's sacred name was being taken in vain; and in proof he appended to the complaint a romance in which the justice of the peace is made to appear about once every ten lines, and sometimes in a drunken condition. Therefore, in order to avoid all unpleasantness, it will be better to describe the department in question only as a certain department. So, in a certain department there was a certain officialnot a very high one, it must be allowedshort of stature, somewhat pock-marked, red-haired, and short-sighted, with a bald forehead, wrinkled cheeks, and a complexion of the kind known as sanguine. The St. Petersburg climate was responsible for this. As for his official status, he was what is called a perpetual titular councillor, over which, as is well known, some writers make merry, and crack their jokes, obeying the praiseworthy custom of attacking those who cannot bite back. His family name was Bashmachkin. This name is evidently derived from bashmak (shoe); but when, at what time, and in what manner, is not known. His father and grandfather, and all the Bashmachkins, always wore boots, which only had new heels two or three times a year. His name was Akakiy Akakievitch. It may strike the reader as rather singular and far-fetched, but he may rest assured that it was by no means far-fetched, and that the circumstances were such that it would have been impossible to give him any other. This is how it came about. Akakiy Akakievitch was born, if my memory fails me not, in the evening of the 23rd of March. His mother, the wife of a Government official and a very fine woman, made all due arrangements for having the child baptised. She was lying on the bed opposite the door; on her right stood the godfather, Ivan Ivanovitch Eroshkin, a most estimable man, who served as presiding officer of the senate; and the godmother, Anna Semenovna Byelobrushkova, the wife of an officer of the quarter, and a woman of rare virtues. They offered the mother her choice of three names, Mokiya, Sossiya, or that the child should be called after the martyr Khozdazat. No, said the good woman, all those names are poor. In order to please her they opened the calendar to another place; three more names appeared, Triphiliy, Dula, and Varakhasiy. This is a judgment, said the old woman. What names! I truly never heard the like. Varada or Varukh might have been borne, but not Triphiliy and Varakhasiy! They turned to another page and found Pavsikakhiy and Vakhtisiy. Now I see, said the old woman, that it is plainly fate. And 2 since such is the case, it will be better to name him after his father. His father's name was Akakiy, so let his son's be Akakiy too. In this manner he became Akakiy Akakievitch. They christened the child, whereat he wept and made a grimace, as though he foresaw that he was to be a titular councillor. In this manner did it all come about. We have mentioned it in order that the reader might see for himself that it was a case of necessity, and that it was utterly impossible to give him any other name. When and how he entered the department, and who appointed him, no one could remember. However much the directors and chiefs of all kinds were changed, he was always to be seen in the same place, the same attitude, the same occupation; so that it was afterwards affirmed that he had been born in undress uniform with a bald head. No respect was shown him in the department. The porter not only did not rise from his seat when he passed, but never even glanced at him, any more than if a fly had flown through the reception-room. His superiors",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
overcoat,1,"treated him in coolly despotic fashion. Some sub-chief would thrust a paper under his nose without so much as saying, Copy, or Here's a nice interesting affair, or anything else agreeable, as is customary amongst well-bred officials. And he took it, looking only at the paper and not observing who handed it to him, or whether he had the right to do so; simply took it, and set about copying it. The young officials laughed at and made fun of him, so far as their official wit permitted; told in his presence various stories concocted about him, and about his landlady, an old woman of seventy; declared that she beat him; asked when the wedding was to be; and strewed bits of paper over his head, calling them snow. But Akakiy Akakievitch answered not a word, any more than if there had been no one there besides himself. It even had no effect upon his work: amid all these annoyances he never made a single mistake in a letter. But if the joking became wholly unbearable, as when they jogged his hand and prevented his attending to his work, he would exclaim, Leave me alone! Why do you insult me? And there was something strange in the words and the voice in which they were uttered. There was in it something which moved to pity; so much that one young man, a new-comer, who, taking pattern by the others, had permitted himself to make sport of Akakiy, suddenly stopped short, as though all about him had undergone a transformation, and presented itself in a different aspect. Some unseen force repelled him from the comrades whose acquaintance he had made, on the supposition that they were well-bred and polite men. Long afterwards, in his gayest moments, there recurred to his mind the little official with the bald forehead, with his heart-rending words, Leave me alone! Why do you insult me? In these moving words, other words resoundedI am thy brother. And the young man covered his face with his hand; and many a time afterwards, in the course of his life, shuddered at seeing how much inhumanity there is in man, how much savage coarseness is concealed beneath delicate, refined worldliness, and even, O God! in that man whom the world acknowledges as honourable and noble. It would be difficult to find another man who lived so entirely for his duties. It is not enough to say that Akakiy laboured with zeal: no, he laboured with love. In his copying, he found a varied and agreeable employment. Enjoyment was written on his face: some letters were even favourites with him; and when he encountered these, he smiled, winked, and worked with his lips, till it seemed as though each letter might be read in his face, as his pen traced it. If his pay had been in proportion to his zeal, he would, perhaps, to his great surprise, have been made even a councillor of state. But he worked, as his companions, the wits, put it, like a horse in a mill. 3 Moreover, it is impossible to say that no attention was paid to him. One director being a kindly man, and desirous of rewarding him for his long service, ordered him to be given something more important than mere copying. So he was ordered to make a report of an already concluded affair to another department: the duty consisting simply in changing the heading and altering a few words from the first to the third person. This caused him so much toil that he broke into a perspiration, rubbed his forehead, and finally said, No, give me rather something to copy. After that they let him copy on forever. Outside this copying, it appeared that nothing existed for him. He gave no thought to his clothes: his undress uniform was not green, but a sort of rusty- meal colour. The collar was low, so that his neck, in spite of the fact that it was not long, seemed inordinately so as it emerged from it, like the necks of those plaster cats which wag their heads, and are carried about upon the heads of scores of image sellers. And something was always sticking to his uniform, either a bit of hay or some trifle. Moreover, he had a peculiar knack, as he walked along the street, of arriving beneath a window just as all sorts of rubbish were being flung out of it: hence he always bore about on his hat scraps of melon rinds and other such articles. Never once in his life did he give heed to what was going on every day in the street; while it is well known that his young brother officials train the range of their glances till they can see when",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
overcoat,2,"any one's trouser straps come undone upon the opposite sidewalk, which always brings a malicious smile to their faces. But Akakiy Akakievitch saw in all things the clean, even strokes of his written lines; and only when a horse thrust his nose, from some unknown quarter, over his shoulder, and sent a whole gust of wind down his neck from his nostrils, did he observe that he was not in the middle of a page, but in the middle of the street. On reaching home, he sat down at once at the table, supped his cabbage soup up quickly, and swallowed a bit of beef with onions, never noticing their taste, and gulping down everything with flies and anything else which the Lord happened to send at the moment. His stomach filled, he rose from the table, and copied papers which he had brought home. If there happened to be none, he took copies for himself, for his own gratification, especially if the document was noteworthy, not on account of its style, but of its being addressed to some distinguished person. Even at the hour when the grey St. Petersburg sky had quite dispersed, and all the official world had eaten or dined, each as he could, in accordance with the salary he received and his own fancy; when all were resting from the departmental jar of pens, running to and fro from their own and other people's indispensable occupations, and from all the work that an uneasy man makes willingly for himself, rather than what is necessary; when officials hasten to dedicate to pleasure the time which is left to them, one bolder than the rest going to the theatre; another, into the street looking under all the bonnets; another wasting his evening in compliments to some pretty girl, the star of a small official circle; anotherand this is the common case of all visiting his comrades on the fourth or third floor, in two small rooms with an ante-room or kitchen, and some pretensions to fashion, such as a lamp or some other trifle which has cost many a sacrifice of dinner or pleasure trip; in a word, at the hour when all officials disperse among the contracted quarters of their friends, to play whist, as they sip their tea from glasses with a kopek's worth of sugar, smoke long pipes, relate at times some bits of gossip which a Russian man can never, under any circumstances, refrain from, and, when there is nothing else to talk of, repeat eternal anecdotes about the commandant to whom they had sent word that the tails of the horses on the Falconet Monument had been cut off, when all strive to divert themselves, Akakiy Akakievitch indulged in no kind of diversion. No one could ever say that he had seen 4 him at any kind of evening party. Having written to his heart's content, he lay down to sleep, smiling at the thought of the coming dayof what God might send him to copy on the morrow. Thus flowed on the peaceful life of the man, who, with a salary of four hundred rubles, understood how to be content with his lot; and thus it would have continued to flow on, perhaps, to extreme old age, were it not that there are various ills strewn along the path of life for titular councillors as well as for private, actual, court, and every other species of councillor, even for those who never give any advice or take any themselves. There exists in St. Petersburg a powerful foe of all who receive a salary of four hundred rubles a year, or thereabouts. This foe is no other than the Northern cold, although it is said to be very healthy. At nine o'clock in the morning, at the very hour when the streets are filled with men bound for the various official departments, it begins to bestow such powerful and piercing nips on all noses impartially that the poor officials really do not know what to do with them. At an hour when the foreheads of even those who occupy exalted positions ache with the cold, and tears start to their eyes, the poor titular councillors are sometimes quite unprotected. Their only salvation lies in traversing as quickly as possible, in their thin little cloaks, five or six streets, and then warming their feet in the porter's room, and so thawing all their talents and qualifications for official service, which had become frozen on the way. Akakiy Akakievitch had felt for some time that his back and shoulders suffered with peculiar poignancy, in spite of the fact that he tried to traverse the distance with all possible speed. He began finally to wonder whether the fault did not lie in his cloak. He examined",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
overcoat,3,"it thoroughly at home, and discovered that in two places, namely, on the back and shoulders, it had become thin as gauze: the cloth was worn to such a degree that he could see through it, and the lining had fallen into pieces. You must know that Akakiy Akakievitch's cloak served as an object of ridicule to the officials: they even refused it the noble name of cloak, and called it a cape. In fact, it was of singular make: its collar diminishing year by year, but serving to patch its other parts. The patching did not exhibit great skill on the part of the tailor, and was, in fact, baggy and ugly. Seeing how the matter stood, Akakiy Akakievitch decided that it would be necessary to take the cloak to Petrovitch, the tailor, who lived somewhere on the fourth floor up a dark stair- case, and who, in spite of his having but one eye, and pock-marks all over his face, busied himself with considerable success in repairing the trousers and coats of officials and others; that is to say, when he was sober and not nursing some other scheme in his head. It is not necessary to say much about this tailor; but, as it is the custom to have the character of each personage in a novel clearly defined, there is no help for it, so here is Petrovitch the tailor. At first he was called only Grigoriy, and was some gentleman's serf; he commenced calling himself Petrovitch from the time when he received his free papers, and further began to drink heavily on all holidays, at first on the great ones, and then on all church festivities without discrimination, wherever a cross stood in the calendar. On this point he was faithful to ancestral custom; and when quarrelling with his wife, he called her a low female and a German. As we have mentioned his wife, it will be necessary to say a word or two about her. Unfortunately, little is known of her beyond the fact that Petrovitch has a wife, who wears a cap and a dress; but cannot lay claim to beauty, at least, no one but the soldiers of the guard even looked under her cap when they met her. Ascending the staircase which led to Petrovitch's roomwhich staircase was all soaked with dish-water, and reeked with the smell of spirits which affects the eyes, and is an inevitable adjunct to all dark stairways in St. Petersburg housesascending the stairs, Akakiy Akakievitch 5 pondered how much Petrovitch would ask, and mentally resolved not to give more than two rubles. The door was open; for the mistress, in cooking some fish, had raised such a smoke in the kitchen that not even the beetles were visible. Akakiy Akakievitch passed through the kitchen unperceived, even by the housewife, and at length reached a room where he beheld Petrovitch seated on a large unpainted table, with his legs tucked under him like a Turkish pasha. His feet were bare, after the fashion of tailors who sit at work; and the first thing which caught the eye was his thumb, with a deformed nail thick and strong as a turtle's shell. About Petrovitch's neck hung a skein of silk and thread, and upon his knees lay some old garment. He had been trying unsuccessfully for three minutes to thread his needle, and was enraged at the darkness and even at the thread, growling in a low voice, It won't go through, the barbarian! you pricked me, you rascal! Akakiy Akakievitch was vexed at arriving at the precise moment when Petrovitch was angry; he liked to order something of Petrovitch when the latter was a little downhearted, or, as his wife expressed it, when he had settled himself with brandy, the one-eyed devil! Under such circumstances, Petrovitch generally came down in his price very readily, and even bowed and returned thanks. Afterwards, to be sure, his wife would come, complaining that her husband was drunk, and so had fixed the price too low; but, if only a ten-kopek piece were added, then the matter was settled. But now it appeared that Petrovitch was in a sober condition, and therefore rough, taciturn, and inclined to demand Satan only knows what price. Akakiy Akakievitch felt this, and would gladly have beat a retreat; but he was in for it. Petrovitch screwed up his one eye very intently at him, and Akakiy Akakievitch involuntarily said: How do you do, Petrovitch? I wish you a good morning, sir, said Petrovitch, squinting at Akakiy Akakievitch's hands, to see what sort of booty he had brought. Ah! Ito you, Petrovitch, this It must be known that Akakiy Akakievitch expressed himself chiefly by prepositions, adverbs, and scraps of phrases which had no meaning whatever.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
overcoat,4,"If the matter was a very difficult one, he had a habit of never completing his sentences; so that frequently, having begun a phrase with the words, This, in fact, is quite he forgot to go on, thinking that he had already finished it. What is it? asked Petrovitch, and with his one eye scanned Akakievitch's whole uniform from the collar down to the cuffs, the back, the tails and the button-holes, all of which were well known to him, since they were his own handiwork. Such is the habit of tailors; it is the first thing they do on meeting one. But I, here, thisPetrovitcha cloak, clothhere you see, everywhere, in different places, it is quite strongit is a little dusty, and looks old, but it is new, only here in one place it is a littleon the back, and here on one of the shoulders, it is a little worn, yes, here on this shoulder it is a littledo you see? that is all. And a little work Petrovitch took the cloak, spread it out, to begin with, on the table, looked hard at it, shook his head, reached out his hand to the window-sill for his snuff-box, adorned with the portrait of some general, though what general is unknown, for the place where the face should have been had been rubbed through by the finger, and a square bit of paper had been pasted over it. Having taken a pinch of snuff, Petrovitch held up the cloak, and inspected it against the light, and again shook his head once more. After which he again lifted the general-adorned lid with its bit of pasted paper, and having stuffed his nose with snuff, closed and put away the snuff-box, and said finally, No, it is impossible to mend it; it's a wretched garment! Akakiy Akakievitch's heart sank at these words. 6 Why is it impossible, Petrovitch? he said, almost in the pleading voice of a child; all that ails it is, that it is worn on the shoulders. You must have some pieces Yes, patches could be found, patches are easily found, said Petrovitch, but there's nothing to sew them to. The thing is completely rotten; if you put a needle to itsee, it will give way. Let it give way, and you can put on another patch at once. But there is nothing to put the patches on to; there's no use in strengthening it; it is too far gone. It's lucky that it's cloth; for, if the wind were to blow, it would fly away. Well, strengthen it again. How will this, in fact No, said Petrovitch decisively, there is nothing to be done with it. It's a thoroughly bad job. You'd better, when the cold winter weather comes on, make yourself some gaiters out of it, because stockings are not warm. The Germans invented them in order to make more money. Petrovitch loved, on all occasions, to have a fling at the Germans. But it is plain you must have a new cloak. At the word new, all grew dark before Akakiy Akakievitch's eyes, and everything in the room began to whirl round. The only thing he saw clearly was the general with the paper face on the lid of Petrovitch's snuff-box. A new one? said he, as if still in a dream: why, I have no money for that. Yes, a new one, said Petrovitch, with barbarous composure. Well, if it came to a new one, how would it? You mean how much would it cost? Yes. Well, you would have to lay out a hundred and fifty or more, said Petrovitch, and pursed up his lips significantly. He liked to produce powerful effects, liked to stun utterly and suddenly, and then to glance sideways to see what face the stunned person would put on the matter. A hundred and fifty rubles for a cloak! shrieked poor Akakiy Akakievitch, perhaps for the first time in his life, for his voice had always been distinguished for softness. Yes, sir, said Petrovitch, for any kind of cloak. If you have a marten fur on the collar, or a silk-lined hood, it will mount up to two hundred. Petrovitch, please, said Akakiy Akakievitch in a beseeching tone, not hearing, and not trying to hear, Petrovitch's words, and disregarding all his effects, some repairs, in order that it may wear yet a little longer. No, it would only be a waste of time and money, said Petrovitch; and Akakiy Akakievitch went away after these words, utterly discouraged. But Petrovitch stood for some time after his departure, with significantly compressed lips, and without betaking himself to his work, satisfied that he would not be dropped, and an artistic tailor employed. Akakiy Akakievitch went out into the street as if in",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no
overcoat,5,"a dream. Such an affair! he said to himself: I did not think it had come to and then after a pause, he added, Well, so it is! see what it has come to at last! and I never imagined that it was so! Then followed a long silence, after which he exclaimed, Well, so it is! see what alreadynothing unexpected thatit would be nothingwhat a strange circumstance! So saying, instead of going home, he went in exactly the opposite direction without himself suspecting it. On the way, a chimney-sweep bumped up against him, and blackened his shoulder, and a whole hatful of rubbish landed on him from the top of a house which was building. He did not notice it; and only when he ran against a watchman, who, having planted his halberd beside him, was shaking some snuff from his box into his horny hand, did he recover himself a little, and that because the watchman said, Why 7 are you poking yourself into a man's very face? Haven't you the pavement? This caused him to look about him, and turn towards home. There only, he finally began to collect his thoughts, and to survey his position in its clear and actual light, and to argue with himself, sensibly and frankly, as with a reasonable friend with whom one can discuss private and personal matters. No, said Akakiy Akakievitch, it is impossible to reason with Petrovitch now; he is thatevidently his wife has been beating him. I'd better go to him on Sunday morning; after Saturday night he will be a little cross-eyed and sleepy, for he will want to get drunk, and his wife won't give him any money; and at such a time, a ten-kopek piece in his hand willhe will become more fit to reason with, and then the cloak, and that Thus argued Akakiy Akakievitch with himself, regained his courage, and waited until the first Sunday, when, seeing from afar that Petrovitch's wife had left the house, he went straight to him. Petrovitch's eye was, indeed, very much askew after Saturday: his head drooped, and he was very sleepy; but for all that, as soon as he knew what it was a question of, it seemed as though Satan jogged his memory. Impossible, said he: please to order a new one. Thereupon Akakiy Akakievitch handed over the ten- kopek piece. Thank you, sir; I will drink your good health, said Petrovitch: but as for the cloak, don't trouble yourself about it; it is good for nothing. I will make you a capital new one, so let us settle about it now. Akakiy Akakievitch was still for mending it; but Petrovitch would not hear of it, and said, I shall certainly have to make you a new one, and you may depend upon it that I shall do my best. It may even be, as the fashion goes, that the collar can be fastened by silver hooks under a flap. Then Akakiy Akakievitch saw that it was impossible to get along without a new cloak, and his spirit sank utterly. How, in fact, was it to be done? Where was the money to come from? He might, to be sure, depend, in part, upon his present at Christmas; but that money had long been allotted beforehand. He must have some new trousers, and pay a debt of long standing to the shoemaker for putting new tops to his old boots, and he must order three shirts from the seamstress, and a couple of pieces of linen. In short, all his money must be spent; and even if the director should be so kind as to order him to receive forty-five rubles instead of forty, or even fifty, it would be a mere nothing, a mere drop in the ocean towards the funds necessary for a cloak: although he knew that Petrovitch was often wrong-headed enough to blurt out some outrageous price, so that even his own wife could not refrain from exclaiming, Have you lost your senses, you fool? At one time he would not work at any price, and now it was quite likely that he had named a higher sum than the cloak would cost. But although he knew that Petrovitch would undertake to make a cloak for eighty rubles, still, where was he to get the eighty rubles from? He might possibly manage half, yes, half might be procured, but where was the other half to come from? But the reader must first be told where the first half came from. Akakiy Akakievitch had a habit of putting, for every ruble he spent, a groschen into a small box, fastened with a lock and key, and with a slit in the top for the reception of money. At the end of every",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no
overcoat,6,"half-year he counted over the heap of coppers, and changed it for silver. This he had done for a long time, and in the course of years, the sum had mounted up to over forty rubles. Thus he had one half on hand; but where was he to find the other half? where was he to get another forty rubles from? Akakiy Akakievitch thought and thought, and decided that it would be necessary to curtail his ordinary expenses, for the space of one year at least, to dispense with tea in the evening; to burn no candles, and, if there was anything which he must do, to go into his landlady's room, and work by her light. When he went 8 into the street, he must walk as lightly as he could, and as cautiously, upon the stones, almost upon tiptoe, in order not to wear his heels down in too short a time; he must give the laundress as little to wash as possible; and, in order not to wear out his clothes, he must take them off, as soon as he got home, and wear only his cotton dressing-gown, which had been long and carefully saved. To tell the truth, it was a little hard for him at first to accustom himself to these deprivations; but he got used to them at length, after a fashion, and all went smoothly. He even got used to being hungry in the evening, but he made up for it by treating himself, so to say, in spirit, by bearing ever in mind the idea of his future cloak. From that time forth his existence seemed to become, in some way, fuller, as if he were married, or as if some other man lived in him, as if, in fact, he were not alone, and some pleasant friend had consented to travel along life's path with him, the friend being no other than the cloak, with thick wadding and a strong lining incapable of wearing out. He became more lively, and even his character grew firmer, like that of a man who has made up his mind, and set himself a goal. From his face and gait, doubt and indecision, all hesitating and wavering traits disappeared of themselves. Fire gleamed in his eyes, and occasionally the boldest and most daring ideas flitted through his mind; why not, for instance, have marten fur on the collar? The thought of this almost made him absent-minded. Once, in copying a letter, he nearly made a mistake, so that he exclaimed almost aloud, Ugh! and crossed himself. Once, in the course of every month, he had a conference with Petrovitch on the subject of the cloak, where it would be better to buy the cloth, and the colour, and the price. He always returned home satisfied, though troubled, reflecting that the time would come at last when it could all be bought, and then the cloak made. The affair progressed more briskly than he had expected. Far beyond all his hopes, the director awarded neither forty nor forty-five rubles for Akakiy Akakievitch's share, but sixty. Whether he suspected that Akakiy Akakievitch needed a cloak, or whether it was merely chance, at all events, twenty extra rubles were by this means provided. This circumstance hastened matters. Two or three months more of hunger and Akakiy Akakievitch had accumulated about eighty rubles. His heart, generally so quiet, began to throb. On the first possible day, he went shopping in company with Petrovitch. They bought some very good cloth, and at a reasonable rate too, for they had been considering the matter for six months, and rarely let a month pass without their visiting the shops to inquire prices. Petrovitch himself said that no better cloth could be had. For lining, they selected a cotton stuff, but so firm and thick that Petrovitch declared it to be better than silk, and even prettier and more glossy. They did not buy the marten fur, because it was, in fact, dear, but in its stead, they picked out the very best of cat-skin which could be found in the shop, and which might, indeed, be taken for marten at a distance. Petrovitch worked at the cloak two whole weeks, for there was a great deal of quilting: otherwise it would have been finished sooner. He charged twelve rubles for the job, it could not possibly have been done for less. It was all sewed with silk, in small, double seams; and Petrovitch went over each seam afterwards with his own teeth, stamping in various patterns. It wasit is difficult to say precisely on what day, but probably the most glorious one in Akakiy Akakievitch's life, when Petrovitch at length brought home the cloak. He brought it in the morning, before the",no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
overcoat,7,"hour when it was necessary to start for the department. Never did a cloak arrive so exactly in the nick of time; for the severe cold had set in, and it seemed to threaten to increase. Petrovitch brought the cloak himself as befits a good tailor. On his countenance was a significant expression, such as Akakiy Akakievitch had never beheld there. He seemed fully 9 sensible that he had done no small deed, and crossed a gulf separating tailors who only put in linings, and execute repairs, from those who make new things. He took the cloak out of the pocket handkerchief in which he had brought it. The handkerchief was fresh from the laundress, and he put it in his pocket for use. Taking out the cloak, he gazed proudly at it, held it up with both hands, and flung it skilfully over the shoulders of Akakiy Akakievitch. Then he pulled it and fitted it down behind with his hand, and he draped it around Akakiy Akakievitch without buttoning it. Akakiy Akakievitch, like an experienced man, wished to try the sleeves. Petrovitch helped him on with them, and it turned out that the sleeves were satisfactory also. In short, the cloak appeared to be perfect, and most seasonable. Petrovitch did not neglect to observe that it was only because he lived in a narrow street, and had no signboard, and had known Akakiy Akakievitch so long, that he had made it so cheaply; but that if he had been in business on the Nevsky Prospect, he would have charged seventy-five rubles for the making alone. Akakiy Akakievitch did not care to argue this point with Petrovitch. He paid him, thanked him, and set out at once in his new cloak for the department. Petrovitch followed him, and, pausing in the street, gazed long at the cloak in the distance, after which he went to one side expressly to run through a crooked alley, and emerge again into the street beyond to gaze once more upon the cloak from another point, namely, directly in front. Meantime Akakiy Akakievitch went on in holiday mood. He was conscious every second of the time that he had a new cloak on his shoulders; and several times he laughed with internal satisfaction. In fact, there were two advantages, one was its warmth, the other its beauty. He saw nothing of the road, but suddenly found himself at the department. He took off his cloak in the ante-room, looked it over carefully, and confided it to the especial care of the attendant. It is impossible to say precisely how it was that everyone in the department knew at once that Akakiy Akakievitch had a new cloak, and that the cape no longer existed. All rushed at the same moment into the ante-room to inspect it. They congratulated him and said pleasant things to him, so that he began at first to smile and then to grow ashamed. When all surrounded him, and said that the new cloak must be christened, and that he must give a whole evening at least to this, Akakiy Akakievitch lost his head completely, and did not know where he stood, what to answer, or how to get out of it. He stood blushing all over for several minutes, and was on the point of assuring them with great simplicity that it was not a new cloak, that it was so and so, that it was in fact the old cape. At length one of the officials, a sub-chief probably, in order to show that he was not at all proud, and on good terms with his inferiors, said, So be it, only I will give the party instead of Akakiy Akakievitch; I invite you all to tea with me to-night; it happens quite a propos, as it is my name-day. The officials naturally at once offered the sub-chief their congratulations and accepted the invitations with pleasure. Akakiy Akakievitch would have declined, but all declared that it was discourteous, that it was simply a sin and a shame, and that he could not possibly refuse. Besides, the notion became pleasant to him when he recollected that he should thereby have a chance of wearing his new cloak in the evening also. That whole day was truly a most triumphant festival day for Akakiy Akakievitch. He returned home in the most happy frame of mind, took off his cloak, and hung it carefully on the wall, admiring afresh the cloth and the lining. Then he brought out his old, worn-out cloak, for comparison. He looked at it and laughed, so vast was the difference. And long after dinner he laughed again when the condition of the cape recurred to his mind. He dined cheerfully, and after dinner wrote nothing, but took his",no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
overcoat,8,"ease for a while on the bed, until it got dark. Then he 10 dressed himself leisurely, put on his cloak, and stepped out into the street. Where the host lived, unfortunately we cannot say: our memory begins to fail us badly; and the houses and streets in St. Petersburg have become so mixed up in our head that it is very difficult to get anything out of it again in proper form. This much is certain, that the official lived in the best part of the city; and therefore it must have been anything but near to Akakiy Akakievitch's residence. Akakiy Akakievitch was first obliged to traverse a kind of wilderness of deserted, dimly-lighted streets; but in proportion as he approached the official's quarter of the city, the streets became more lively, more populous, and more brilliantly illuminated. Pedestrians began to appear; handsomely dressed ladies were more frequently encountered; the men had otter skin collars to their coats; peasant waggoners, with their grate-like sledges stuck over with brass-headed nails, became rarer; whilst on the other hand, more and more drivers in red velvet caps, lacquered sledges and bear-skin coats began to appear, and carriages with rich hammer-cloths flew swiftly through the streets, their wheels scrunching the snow. Akakiy Akakievitch gazed upon all this as upon a novel sight. He had not been in the streets during the evening for years. He halted out of curiosity before a shop-window to look at a picture representing a handsome woman, who had thrown off her shoe, thereby baring her whole foot in a very pretty way; whilst behind her the head of a man with whiskers and a handsome moustache peeped through the doorway of another room. Akakiy Akakievitch shook his head and laughed, and then went on his way. Why did he laugh? Either because he had met with a thing utterly unknown, but for which every one cherishes, nevertheless, some sort of feeling; or else he thought, like many officials, as follows: Well, those French! What is to be said? If they do go in anything of that sort, why But possibly he did not think at all. Akakiy Akakievitch at length reached the house in which the sub-chief lodged. The sub- chief lived in fine style: the staircase was lit by a lamp; his apartment being on the second floor. On entering the vestibule, Akakiy Akakievitch beheld a whole row of goloshes on the floor. Among them, in the centre of the room, stood a samovar humming and emitting clouds of steam. On the walls hung all sorts of coats and cloaks, among which there were even some with beaver collars or velvet facings. Beyond, the buzz of conversation was audible, and became clear and loud when the servant came out with a trayful of empty glasses, cream-jugs, and sugar-bowls. It was evident that the officials had arrived long before and had already finished their first glass of tea. Akakiy Akakievitch, having hung up his own cloak, entered the inner room. Before him all at once appeared lights, officials, pipes, and card-tables; and he was bewildered by the sound of rapid conversation rising from all the tables, and the noise of moving chairs. He halted very awkwardly in the middle of the room, wondering what he ought to do. But they had seen him. They received him with a shout, and all thronged at once into the ante-room, and there took another look at his cloak. Akakiy Akakievitch, although somewhat confused, was frank-hearted, and could not refrain from rejoicing when he saw how they praised his cloak. Then, of course, they all dropped him and his cloak, and returned, as was proper, to the tables set out for whist. All this, the noise, the talk, and the throng of people was rather overwhelming to Akakiy Akakievitch. He simply did not know where he stood, or where to put his hands, his feet, and his whole body. Finally he sat down by the players, looked at the cards, gazed at the face of one and another, and after a while began to gape, and to feel that it was wearisome, the more so as the hour was already long past when he usually went to bed. He wanted to take leave of the host; but they would not let him go, saying that he must not fail to drink a glass of champagne in honour 11 of his new garment. In the course of an hour, supper, consisting of vegetable salad, cold veal, pastry, confectioner's pies, and champagne, was served. They made Akakiy Akakievitch drink two glasses of champagne, after which he felt things grow livelier. Still, he could not forget that it was twelve o'clock, and that he should have been at home long ago. In order that the",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
overcoat,9,"host might not think of some excuse for detaining him, he stole out of the room quickly, sought out, in the ante-room, his cloak, which, to his sorrow, he found lying on the floor, brushed it, picked off every speck upon it, put it on his shoulders, and descended the stairs to the street. In the street all was still bright. Some petty shops, those permanent clubs of servants and all sorts of folk, were open. Others were shut, but, nevertheless, showed a streak of light the whole length of the door-crack, indicating that they were not yet free of company, and that probably some domestics, male and female, were finishing their stories and conversations whilst leaving their masters in complete ignorance as to their whereabouts. Akakiy Akakievitch went on in a happy frame of mind: he even started to run, without knowing why, after some lady, who flew past like a flash of lightning. But he stopped short, and went on very quietly as before, wondering why he had quickened his pace. Soon there spread before him those deserted streets, which are not cheerful in the daytime, to say nothing of the evening. Now they were even more dim and lonely: the lanterns began to grow rarer, oil, evidently, had been less liberally supplied. Then came wooden houses and fences: not a soul anywhere; only the snow sparkled in the streets, and mournfully veiled the low-roofed cabins with their closed shutters. He approached the spot where the street crossed a vast square with houses barely visible on its farther side, a square which seemed a fearful desert. Afar, a tiny spark glimmered from some watchman's box, which seemed to stand on the edge of the world. Akakiy Akakievitch's cheerfulness diminished at this point in a marked degree. He entered the square, not without an involuntary sensation of fear, as though his heart warned him of some evil. He glanced back and on both sides, it was like a sea about him. No, it is better not to look, he thought, and went on, closing his eyes. When he opened them, to see whether he was near the end of the square, he suddenly beheld, standing just before his very nose, some bearded individuals of precisely what sort he could not make out. All grew dark before his eyes, and his heart throbbed. But, of course, the cloak is mine! said one of them in a loud voice, seizing hold of his collar. Akakiy Akakievitch was about to shout watch, when the second man thrust a fist, about the size of a man's head, into his mouth, muttering, Now scream! Akakiy Akakievitch felt them strip off his cloak and give him a push with a knee: he fell headlong upon the snow, and felt no more. In a few minutes he recovered consciousness and rose to his feet; but no one was there. He felt that it was cold in the square, and that his cloak was gone; he began to shout, but his voice did not appear to reach to the outskirts of the square. In despair, but without ceasing to shout, he started at a run across the square, straight towards the watchbox, beside which stood the watchman, leaning on his halberd, and apparently curious to know what kind of a customer was running towards him and shouting. Akakiy Akakievitch ran up to him, and began in a sobbing voice to shout that he was asleep, and attended to nothing, and did not see when a man was robbed. The watchman replied that he had seen two men stop him in the middle of the square, but supposed that they were friends of his; and that, instead of scolding vainly, he had better go to the police on the morrow, so that they might make a search for whoever had stolen the cloak. 12 Akakiy Akakievitch ran home in complete disorder; his hair, which grew very thinly upon his temples and the back of his head, wholly disordered; his body, arms, and legs covered with snow. The old woman, who was mistress of his lodgings, on hearing a terrible knocking, sprang hastily from her bed, and, with only one shoe on, ran to open the door, pressing the sleeve of her chemise to her bosom out of modesty; but when she had opened it, she fell back on beholding Akakiy Akakievitch in such a state. When he told her about the affair, she clasped her hands, and said that he must go straight to the district chief of police, for his subordinate would turn up his nose, promise well, and drop the matter there. The very best thing to do, therefore, would be to go to the district chief, whom she knew, because Finnish Anna, her former cook,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
overcoat,10,"was now nurse at his house. She often saw him passing the house; and he was at church every Sunday, praying, but at the same time gazing cheerfully at everybody; so that he must be a good man, judging from all appearances. Having listened to this opinion, Akakiy Akakievitch betook himself sadly to his room; and how he spent the night there anyone who can put himself in another's place may readily imagine. Early in the morning, he presented himself at the district chief's, but was told that this official was asleep. He went again at ten and was again informed that he was asleep; at eleven, and they said: The superintendent is not at home; at dinner time, and the clerks in the ante- room would not admit him on any terms, and insisted upon knowing his business. So that at last, for once in his life, Akakiy Akakievitch felt an inclination to show some spirit, and said curtly that he must see the chief in person; that they ought not to presume to refuse him entrance; that he came from the department of justice, and that when he complained of them, they would see. The clerks dared make no reply to this, and one of them went to call the chief, who listened to the strange story of the theft of the coat. Instead of directing his attention to the principal points of the matter, he began to question Akakiy Akakievitch: Why was he going home so late? Was he in the habit of doing so, or had he been to some disorderly house? So that Akakiy Akakievitch got thoroughly confused, and left him without knowing whether the affair of his cloak was in proper train or not. All that day, for the first time in his life, he never went near the department. The next day he made his appearance, very pale, and in his old cape, which had become even more shabby. The news of the robbery of the cloak touched many; although there were some officials present who never lost an opportunity, even such a one as the present, of ridiculing Akakiy Akakievitch. They decided to make a collection for him on the spot, but the officials had already spent a great deal in subscribing for the director's portrait, and for some book, at the suggestion of the head of that division, who was a friend of the author; and so the sum was trifling. One of them, moved by pity, resolved to help Akakiy Akakievitch with some good advice at least, and told him that he ought not to go to the police, for although it might happen that a police-officer, wishing to win the approval of his superiors, might hunt up the cloak by some means, still his cloak would remain in the possession of the police if he did not offer legal proof that it belonged to him. The best thing for him, therefore, would be to apply to a certain prominent personage; since this prominent personage, by entering into relations with the proper persons, could greatly expedite the matter. As there was nothing else to be done, Akakiy Akakievitch decided to go to the prominent personage. What was the exact official position of the prominent personage remains unknown to this day. The reader must know that the prominent personage had but recently become a prominent personage, having up to that time been only an insignificant person. Moreover, his 13 present position was not considered prominent in comparison with others still more so. But there is always a circle of people to whom what is insignificant in the eyes of others, is important enough. Moreover, he strove to increase his importance by sundry devices; for instance, he managed to have the inferior officials meet him on the staircase when he entered upon his service; no one was to presume to come directly to him, but the strictest etiquette must be observed; the collegiate recorder must make a report to the government secretary, the government secretary to the titular councillor, or whatever other man was proper, and all business must come before him in this manner. In Holy Russia all is thus contaminated with the love of imitation; every man imitates and copies his superior. They even say that a certain titular councillor, when promoted to the head of some small separate room, immediately partitioned off a private room for himself, called it the audience chamber, and posted at the door a lackey with red collar and braid, who grasped the handle of the door and opened to all comers; though the audience chamber could hardly hold an ordinary writing-table. The manners and customs of the prominent personage were grand and imposing, but rather exaggerated. The main foundation of his system was strictness.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
overcoat,11,"Strictness, strictness, and always strictness! he generally said; and at the last word he looked significantly into the face of the person to whom he spoke. But there was no necessity for this, for the half-score of subordinates who formed the entire force of the office were properly afraid; on catching sight of him afar off they left their work and waited, drawn up in line, until he had passed through the room. His ordinary converse with his inferiors smacked of sternness, and consisted chiefly of three phrases: How dare you? Do you know whom you are speaking to? Do you realise who stands before you? Otherwise he was a very kind-hearted man, good to his comrades, and ready to oblige; but the rank of general threw him completely off his balance. On receiving any one of that rank, he became confused, lost his way, as it were, and never knew what to do. If he chanced to be amongst his equals he was still a very nice kind of man, a very good fellow in many respects, and not stupid; but the very moment that he found himself in the society of people but one rank lower than himself he became silent; and his situation aroused sympathy, the more so as he felt himself that he might have been making an incomparably better use of his time. In his eyes there was sometimes visible a desire to join some interesting conversation or group; but he was kept back by the thought, Would it not be a very great condescension on his part? Would it not be familiar? and would he not thereby lose his importance? And in consequence of such reflections he always remained in the same dumb state, uttering from time to time a few monosyllabic sounds, and thereby earning the name of the most wearisome of men. To this prominent personage Akakiy Akakievitch presented himself, and this at the most unfavourable time for himself though opportune for the prominent personage. The prominent personage was in his cabinet conversing gaily with an old acquaintance and companion of his childhood whom he had not seen for several years and who had just arrived when it was announced to him that a person named Bashmatchkin had come. He asked abruptly, Who is he?Some official, he was informed. Ah, he can wait! this is no time for him to call, said the important man. It must be remarked here that the important man lied outrageously: he had said all he had to say to his friend long before; and the conversation had been interspersed for some time with very long pauses, during which they merely slapped each other on the leg, and said, You think so, Ivan Abramovitch! Just so, Stepan Varlamitch! Nevertheless, he ordered that the official 14 should be kept waiting, in order to show his friend, a man who had not been in the service for a long time, but had lived at home in the country, how long officials had to wait in his ante-room. At length, having talked himself completely out, and more than that, having had his fill of pauses, and smoked a cigar in a very comfortable arm-chair with reclining back, he suddenly seemed to recollect, and said to the secretary, who stood by the door with papers of reports, So it seems that there is a tchinovnik waiting to see me. Tell him that he may come in. On perceiving Akakiy Akakievitch's modest mien and his worn undress uniform, he turned abruptly to him and said, What do you want? in a curt hard voice, which he had practised in his room in private, and before the looking-glass, for a whole week before being raised to his present rank. Akakiy Akakievitch, who was already imbued with a due amount of fear, became somewhat confused: and as well as his tongue would permit, explained, with a rather more frequent addition than usual of the word that, that his cloak was quite new, and had been stolen in the most inhuman manner; that he had applied to him in order that he might, in some way, by his intermediationthat he might enter into correspondence with the chief of police, and find the cloak. For some inexplicable reason this conduct seemed familiar to the prominent personage. What, my dear sir! he said abruptly, are you not acquainted with etiquette? Where have you come from? Don't you know how such matters are managed? You should first have entered a complaint about this at the court below: it would have gone to the head of the department, then to the chief of the division, then it would have been handed over to the secretary, and the secretary would have given it to me. But, your excellency, said Akakiy",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
overcoat,12,"Akakievitch, trying to collect his small handful of wits, and conscious at the same time that he was perspiring terribly, I, your excellency, presumed to trouble you because secretariesare an untrustworthy race. What, what, what! said the important personage. Where did you get such courage? Where did you get such ideas? What impudence towards their chiefs and superiors has spread among the young generation! The prominent personage apparently had not observed that Akakiy Akakievitch was already in the neighborhood of fifty. If he could be called a young man, it must have been in comparison with someone who was seventy. Do you know to whom you speak? Do you realise who stands before you? Do you realise it? do you realise it? I ask you! Then he stamped his foot and raised his voice to such a pitch that it would have frightened even a different man from Akakiy Akakievitch. Akakiy Akakievitch's senses failed him; he staggered, trembled in every limb, and, if the porters had not run to support him, would have fallen to the floor. They carried him out insensible. But the prominent personage, gratified that the effect should have surpassed his expectations, and quite intoxicated with the thought that his word could even deprive a man of his senses, glanced sideways at his friend in order to see how he looked upon this, and perceived, not without satisfaction, that his friend was in a most uneasy frame of mind, and even beginning, on his part, to feel a trifle frightened. Akakiy Akakievitch could not remember how he descended the stairs and got into the street. He felt neither his hands nor feet. Never in his life had he been so rated by any high official, let alone a strange one. He went staggering on through the snow-storm, which was blowing in the streets, with his mouth wide open; the wind, in St. Petersburg fashion, darted upon him from all quarters, and down every cross-street. In a twinkling it had blown a quinsy into his throat, and he 15 reached home unable to utter a word. His throat was swollen, and he lay down on his bed. So powerful is sometimes a good scolding! The next day a violent fever showed itself. Thanks to the generous assistance of the St. Petersburg climate, the malady progressed more rapidly than could have been expected: and when the doctor arrived, he found, on feeling the sick man's pulse, that there was nothing to be done, except to prescribe a fomentation, so that the patient might not be left entirely without the beneficent aid of medicine; but at the same time, he predicted his end in thirty-six hours. After this he turned to the landlady, and said, And as for you, don't waste your time on him: order his pine coffin now, for an oak one will be too expensive for him. Did Akakiy Akakievitch hear these fatal words? and if he heard them, did they produce any overwhelming effect upon him? Did he lament the bitterness of his life?We know not, for he continued in a delirious condition. Visions incessantly appeared to him, each stranger than the other. Now he saw Petrovitch, and ordered him to make a cloak, with some traps for robbers, who seemed to him to be always under the bed; and cried every moment to the landlady to pull one of them from under his coverlet. Then he inquired why his old mantle hung before him when he had a new cloak. Next he fancied that he was standing before the prominent person, listening to a thorough setting-down, and saying, Forgive me, your excellency! but at last he began to curse, uttering the most horrible words, so that his aged landlady crossed herself, never in her life having heard anything of the kind from him, the more so as those words followed directly after the words your excellency. Later on he talked utter nonsense, of which nothing could be made: all that was evident being, that his incoherent words and thoughts hovered ever about one thing, his cloak. At length poor Akakiy Akakievitch breathed his last. They sealed up neither his room nor his effects, because, in the first place, there were no heirs, and, in the second, there was very little to inherit beyond a bundle of goose-quills, a quire of white official paper, three pairs of socks, two or three buttons which had burst off his trousers, and the mantle already known to the reader. To whom all this fell, God knows. I confess that the person who told me this tale took no interest in the matter. They carried Akakiy Akakievitch out and buried him. And St. Petersburg was left without Akakiy Akakievitch, as though he had never lived there. A being disappeared who",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
overcoat,13,"was protected by none, dear to none, interesting to none, and who never even attracted to himself the attention of those students of human nature who omit no opportunity of thrusting a pin through a common fly, and examining it under the microscope. A being who bore meekly the jibes of the department, and went to his grave without having done one unusual deed, but to whom, nevertheless, at the close of his life appeared a bright visitant in the form of a cloak, which momentarily cheered his poor life, and upon whom, thereafter, an intolerable misfortune descended, just as it descends upon the mighty of this world! Several days after his death, the porter was sent from the department to his lodgings, with an order for him to present himself there immediately; the chief commanding it. But the porter had to return unsuccessful, with the answer that he could not come; and to the question, Why? replied, Well, because he is dead! he was buried four days ago. In this manner did they hear of Akakiy Akakievitch's death at the department, and the next day a new official sat in his place, with a handwriting by no means so upright, but more inclined and slanting. But who could have imagined that this was not really the end of Akakiy Akakievitch, that he was destined to raise a commotion after death, as if in compensation for his utterly insignificant life? But so it happened, and our poor story unexpectedly gains a fantastic ending. 16 A rumour suddenly spread through St. Petersburg that a dead man had taken to appearing on the Kalinkin Bridge and its vicinity at night in the form of an official seeking a stolen cloak, and that, under the pretext of its being the stolen cloak, he dragged, without regard to rank or calling, every one's cloak from his shoulders, be it cat-skin, beaver, fox, bear, sable; in a word, every sort of fur and skin which men adopted for their covering. One of the department officials saw the dead man with his own eyes and immediately recognised in him Akakiy Akakievitch. This, however, inspired him with such terror that he ran off with all his might, and therefore did not scan the dead man closely, but only saw how the latter threatened him from afar with his finger. Constant complaints poured in from all quarters that the backs and shoulders, not only of titular but even of court councillors, were exposed to the danger of a cold on account of the frequent dragging off of their cloaks. Arrangements were made by the police to catch the corpse, alive or dead, at any cost, and punish him as an example to others in the most severe manner. In this they nearly succeeded; for a watchman, on guard in Kirushkin Alley, caught the corpse by the collar on the very scene of his evil deeds, when attempting to pull off the frieze coat of a retired musician. Having seized him by the collar, he summoned, with a shout, two of his comrades, whom he enjoined to hold him fast while he himself felt for a moment in his boot, in order to draw out his snuff-box and refresh his frozen nose. But the snuff was of a sort which even a corpse could not endure. The watchman having closed his right nostril with his finger, had no sooner succeeded in holding half a handful up to the left than the corpse sneezed so violently that he completely filled the eyes of all three. While they raised their hands to wipe them, the dead man vanished completely, so that they positively did not know whether they had actually had him in their grip at all. Thereafter the watchmen conceived such a terror of dead men that they were afraid even to seize the living, and only screamed from a distance, Hey, there! go your way! So the dead tchinovnik began to appear even beyond the Kalinkin Bridge, causing no little terror to all timid people. But we have totally neglected that certain prominent personage who may really be considered as the cause of the fantastic turn taken by this true history. First of all, justice compels us to say that after the departure of poor, annihilated Akakiy Akakievitch he felt something like remorse. Suffering was unpleasant to him, for his heart was accessible to many good impulses, in spite of the fact that his rank often prevented his showing his true self. As soon as his friend had left his cabinet, he began to think about poor Akakiy Akakievitch. And from that day forth, poor Akakiy Akakievitch, who could not bear up under an official reprimand, recurred to his mind almost every day. The thought troubled him to such",no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
overcoat,14,"an extent that a week later he even resolved to send an official to him, to learn whether he really could assist him; and when it was reported to him that Akakiy Akakievitch had died suddenly of fever, he was startled, hearkened to the reproaches of his conscience, and was out of sorts for the whole day. Wishing to divert his mind in some way, and drive away the disagreeable impression, he set out that evening for one of his friends' houses, where he found quite a large party assembled. What was better, nearly everyone was of the same rank as himself, so that he need not feel in the least constrained. This had a marvellous effect upon his mental state. He grew expansive, made himself agreeable in conversation, in short, he passed a delightful evening. After supper he drank a couple of glasses of champagnenot a bad recipe for cheerfulness, as everyone knows. The champagne inclined him to various adventures; and he determined not to return home, but to go and see a certain well-known lady of German extraction, Karolina Ivanovna, a lady, it appears, with whom he was on a very friendly footing. 17 It must be mentioned that the prominent personage was no longer a young man, but a good husband and respected father of a family. Two sons, one of whom was already in the service, and a good-looking, sixteen-year-old daughter, with a rather retrousse but pretty little nose, came every morning to kiss his hand and say, Bonjour, papa. His wife, a still fresh and good-looking woman, first gave him her hand to kiss, and then, reversing the procedure, kissed his. But the prominent personage, though perfectly satisfied in his domestic relations, considered it stylish to have a friend in another quarter of the city. This friend was scarcely prettier or younger than his wife; but there are such puzzles in the world, and it is not our place to judge them. So the important personage descended the stairs, stepped into his sledge, said to the coachman, To Karolina Ivanovna's, and, wrapping himself luxuriously in his warm cloak, found himself in that delightful frame of mind than which a Russian can conceive no better, namely, when you think of nothing yourself, yet when the thoughts creep into your mind of their own accord, each more agreeable than the other, giving you no trouble either to drive them away or seek them. Fully satisfied, he recalled all the gay features of the evening just passed, and all the mots which had made the little circle laugh. Many of them he repeated in a low voice, and found them quite as funny as before; so it is not surprising that he should laugh heartily at them. Occasionally, however, he was interrupted by gusts of wind, which, coming suddenly, God knows whence or why, cut his face, drove masses of snow into it, filled out his cloak-collar like a sail, or suddenly blew it over his head with supernatural force, and thus caused him constant trouble to disentangle himself. Suddenly the important personage felt some one clutch him firmly by the collar. Turning round, he perceived a man of short stature, in an old, worn uniform, and recognised, not without terror, Akakiy Akakievitch. The official's face was white as snow, and looked just like a corpse's. But the horror of the important personage transcended all bounds when he saw the dead man's mouth open, and, with a terrible odour of the grave, gave vent to the following remarks: Ah, here you are at last! I have you, thatby the collar! I need your cloak; you took no trouble about mine, but reprimanded me; so now give up your own. The pallid prominent personage almost died of fright. Brave as he was in the office and in the presence of inferiors generally, and although, at the sight of his manly form and appearance, every one said, Ugh! how much character he has! at this crisis, he, like many possessed of an heroic exterior, experienced such terror, that, not without cause, he began to fear an attack of illness. He flung his cloak hastily from his shoulders and shouted to his coachman in an unnatural voice, Home at full speed! The coachman, hearing the tone which is generally employed at critical moments and even accompanied by something much more tangible, drew his head down between his shoulders in case of an emergency, flourished his whip, and flew on like an arrow. In a little more than six minutes the prominent personage was at the entrance of his own house. Pale, thoroughly scared, and cloakless, he went home instead of to Karolina Ivanovna's, reached his room somehow or other, and passed the night in the direst distress; so that the next",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
overcoat,15,"morning over their tea his daughter said, You are very pale to-day, papa. But papa remained silent, and said not a word to any one of what had happened to him, where he had been, or where he had intended to go. This occurrence made a deep impression upon him. He even began to say: How dare you? do you realise who stands before you? less frequently to the under-officials, and if he did utter the words, it was only after having first learned the bearings of the matter. But the most noteworthy point was, that from that day forward the apparition of the dead tchinovnik ceased to 18 be seen. Evidently the prominent personage's cloak just fitted his shoulders; at all events, no more instances of his dragging cloaks from people's shoulders were heard of. But many active and apprehensive persons could by no means reassure themselves, and asserted that the dead tchinovnik still showed himself in distant parts of the city. In fact, one watchman in Kolomna saw with his own eyes the apparition come from behind a house. But being rather weak of body, he dared not arrest him, but followed him in the dark, until, at length, the apparition looked round, paused, and inquired, What do you want? at the same time showing a fist such as is never seen on living men. The watchman said, It's of no consequence, and turned back instantly. But the apparition was much too tall, wore huge moustaches, and, directing its steps apparently towards the Obukhoff bridge, disappeared in the darkness of the night.",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",0,"The War of the Worlds The War of the Worlds H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells 1898 1 The War of the Worlds BOOK ONE THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS 2 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER ONE THE EVE OF THE WAR No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scru- tinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a mis- sionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment. The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, re- volves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence. Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to the very end of the nineteenth century, ex- pressed any idea that intelligent 3 The War of the Worlds life might have developed there far, or indeed at all, beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that since Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that it is not only more distant from time's beginning but nearer its end. The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is still largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter. Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to us is still incredibly remote, has become a present- day problem for the inhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And looking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas. And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their only escape from the destruction that, generation after gener- ation, creeps upon them. And before we judge of them too harshly we must remem- ber what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",1,"upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely 4 The War of the Worlds swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immi- grants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit? The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing subtlety--their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of ours-- and to have carried out their prepara- tions with a well-nigh perfect unanimity. Had our instru- ments permitted it, we might have seen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century. Men like Schiaparelli watched the red planet--it is odd, by-the-bye, that for count- less centuries Mars has been the star of war--but failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready. During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of it first in the issue of NATURE dated August 2. I am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk into their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak during the next two oppositions. The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange palpitating with the amazing intelli- gence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted, indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an enormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of fire had become invisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared it to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, ""as flaming gases rushed out of a gun."" A singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet the next day there was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the DAILY TELEGRAPH, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest dangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at 5 The War of the Worlds Ottershaw. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of his feel- ings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet. In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking of the clockwork of the tele- scope, the little slit in the roof--an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible. Looking through the telescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field. It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect round. But so little it was, so silvery warm--a pin's-head of light! It was as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view. As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired. Forty millions of miles it was from us--more than forty millions of miles of void. Few people realise the im- mensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims. Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light, three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the unfathomable darkness of empty space. You know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night. In a tele- scope it seems far profounder. And invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible distance, drawing nearer every min- ute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring missile. That night, too, there",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",2,"was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet. I saw it. A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place. The night was warm and I was thirsty, and I went 6 The War of the Worlds stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark- ness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us. That night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first one. I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house. Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace. He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having in- habitants who were signalling us. His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in progress. He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets. ""The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one,"" he said. Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after about midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a flame each night. Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth has attempted to explain. It may be the gases of the firing caused the Martians in- convenience. Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness of the planet's atmos- phere and obscured its more familiar features. Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon Mars. The seriocomic periodi- cal PUNCH, I remember, made a happy use of it in the political cartoon. And, all unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by 7 The War of the Worlds day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as they did. I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days. People in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers. For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed. One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife. It was starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so many telescopes were pointed. It was a warm night. Coming home, a party of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing music. There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the people went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance. My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky. It seemed so safe and tranquil. 8 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER TWO THE FALLING STAR Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star. Albin de- scribed it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on meteor- ites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",3,"fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him. I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only looked up as it passed. Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound. I myself heard nothing of that. Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night. But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of finding it. Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the sand pits. An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away. The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against the dawn. The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to frag- ments in its descent. The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder, caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation. It had a 9 The War of the Worlds diameter of about thirty yards. He approached the mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most meteorites are rounded more or less completely. It was, however, still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach. A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow. He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already warm. He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint movements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the common. Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker, the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the circular edge of the end. It was dropping off in flakes and raining down upon the sand. A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth. For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the Thing more clearly. He fancied even then that the cooling of the body might account for this, but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder. And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the cylinder was rotating on its body. It was such a gradual movement that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the circumference. Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated, until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so. Then the thing came upon him in a flash. The cylinder was artificial--hollow--with an end that screwed out! Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top! ""Good heavens!"" said Ogilvy. ""There's a man in it--men in it! Half 10 The War of the Worlds roasted to death! Trying to escape!"" At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the flash upon Mars. The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn. But luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands on the still- glowing metal. At that he stood irresolute for a moment, then turned, scrambled out",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",4,"of the pit, and set off running wildly into Woking. The time then must have been somewhere about six o'clock. He met a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he told and his appearance were so wild--his hat had fallen off in the pit--that the man simply drove on. He was equally unsuccessful with the potman who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge. The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to shut him into the taproom. That sobered him a little; and when he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his garden, he called over the palings and made himself understood. ""Henderson,"" he called, ""you saw that shooting star last night?"" ""Well?"" said Henderson. ""It's out on Horsell Common now."" ""Good Lord!"" said Henderson. ""Fallen meteorite! That's good."" ""But it's something more than a meteorite. It's a cylinder --an artificial cylinder, man! And there's something inside."" Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand. ""What's that?"" he said. He was deaf in one ear. Ogilvy told him all that he had seen. Henderson was a minute or so taking it in. Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and came out into the road. The two men hurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder still lying in the same position. But now the sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder. Air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound. They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and, meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside 11 The War of the Worlds must be insensible or dead. Of course the two were quite unable to do anything. They shouted consolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get help. One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and disordered, running up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows. Henderson went into the railway station at once, in order to telegraph the news to London. The newspaper articles had prepared men's minds for the re- ception of the idea. By eight o'clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already started for the common to see the ""dead men from Mars."" That was the form the story took. I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a quarter to nine when I went out to get my DAILY CHRONICLE. I was naturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the Ottershaw bridge to the sand pits. 12 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER THREE ON HORSELL COMMON I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people sur- rounding the huge hole in which the cylinder lay. I have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk, em- bedded in the ground. The turf and gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion. No doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire. Henderson and Ogilvy were not there. I think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present, and had gone away to breakfast at Henderson's house. There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their feet dangling, and amusing themselves--until I stopped them--by throwing stones at the giant mass. After I had spoken to them about it, they began playing at ""touch"" in and out of the group of bystanders. Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his little boy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to hang about the railway station. There was very little talking. Few of the common people in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical ideas in those days. Most of them were staring quietly at the big tablelike end of the cylinder, which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had left it. I fancy the popular ex- pectation of a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate bulk. Some went away while I was there, and other people came. I clambered into the pit and fancied I heard a faint movement under my feet. The top had certainly ceased to rotate. It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this object was at all evident to me. At the first glance it was really no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",5,"Not so much so, indeed. It looked like a rusty gas float. It required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue. ""Extra- 13 The War of the Worlds terrestrial"" had no meaning for most of the onlookers. At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come from the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it contained any living creature. I thought the unscrewing might be automatic. In spite of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men in Mars. My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the difficulties in translation that might arise, whether we should find coins and models in it, and so forth. Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea. I felt an impatience to see it opened. About eleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back, full of such thought, to my home in Maybury. But I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract investigations. In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much. The early editions of the evening papers had startled London with enormous headlines: ""A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS."" ""REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,"" and so forth. In addition, Ogilvy's wire to the Astronomical Exchange had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms. There were half a dozen flies or more from the Woking station standing in the road by the sand pits, a basket- chaise from Chobham, and a rather lordly carriage. Besides that, there was quite a heap of bicycles. In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in spite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there was altogether quite a considerable crowd--one or two gaily dressed ladies among the others. It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind, and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees. The burning heather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards Ottershaw was blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off vertical streamers of smoke. An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger beer. Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of about half a dozen men--Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man that I afterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with several 14 The War of the Worlds workmen wielding spades and pickaxes. Stent was giving directions in a clear, high- pitched voice. He was standing on the cylinder, which was now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and stream- ing with perspiration, and something seemed to have irritated him. A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its lower end was still embedded. As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and asked me if I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor. The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to their excavations, especially the boys. They wanted a light railing put up, and help to keep the people back. He told me that a faint stirring was occasionally still audible within the case, but that the workmen had failed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them. The case appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior. I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure. I failed to find Lord Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from London by the six o'clock train from Waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter past five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to the station to waylay him. 15 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER FOUR THE CYLINDER OPENS When I returned to the common the sun was setting. Scattered groups were hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons were returning. The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black against the lemon yellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people, perhaps. There were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appeared to be going on about the pit. Strange imaginings passed through my mind. As I drew nearer I heard Stent's voice: ""Keep",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",6,"back! Keep back!"" A boy came running towards me. ""It's a-movin',"" he said to me as he passed; ""a-screwin' and a-screwin' out. I don't like it. I'm a-goin' 'ome, I am."" I went on to the crowd. There were really, I should think, two or three hundred people elbowing and jostling one an- other, the one or two ladies there being by no means the least active. ""He's fallen in the pit!"" cried some one. ""Keep back!"" said several. The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through. Every one seemed greatly excited. I heard a peculiar hum- ming sound from the pit. ""I say!"" said Ogilvy; ""help keep these idiots back. We don't know what's in the confounded thing, you know!"" I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was, standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again. The crowd had pushed him in. The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within. Nearly two feet of shining screw projected. Somebody blun- dered against me, and I narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw. I turned, and as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion. I stuck my elbow into the person behind me, and turned my head towards the Thing again. For a 16 The War of the Worlds moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had the sunset in my eyes. I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essen- tials a man. I know I did. But, looking, I presently saw some- thing stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two luminous disks--like eyes. Then something resembling a little grey snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another. A sudden chill came over me. There was a loud shriek from a woman behind. I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still, from which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit. I saw astonishment giving place to horror on the faces of the people about me. I heard inarticulate exclama- tions on all sides. There was a general movement backwards. I saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit. I found myself alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off, Stent among them. I looked again at the cylinder, and ungovernable terror gripped me. I stood petri- fied and staring. A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder. As it bulged up and caught the light, it glistened like wet leather. Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me stead- fastly. The mass that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one might say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air. Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth, the Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement 17 The War of the Worlds due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth--above all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes--were at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There was something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedi- ous movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first en- counter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread. Suddenly the monster vanished. It had toppled over the brim of the cylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great mass of leather. I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the aperture. I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees, perhaps a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for I could not avert my face from these things. There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped, panting, and waited further",no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",7,"developments. The common round the sand pits was dotted with people, stand- ing like myself in a half-fascinated terror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay. And then, with a renewed horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on the edge of the pit. It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in, but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun. Now he got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until only his head was visible. Suddenly he van- ished, and I could have fancied a faint shriek had reached me. I had a momentary impulse to go back and help him that my fears overruled. Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and the heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made. Anyone coming along the road from Chobham or Wo- king would have been amazed at the sight- -a dwindling mul- titude of perhaps a hundred people or more standing in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind gates and hedges, saying little to one another and that in short, excited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of sand. The barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black against the burning sky, and in the sand pits was a row of deserted vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground. 18 The War of the Worlds 19 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER FIVE THE HEAT-RAY After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind of fascination paralysed my actions. I remained standing knee-deep in the heather, staring at the mound that hid them. I was a battleground of fear and curiosity. I did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a pas- sionate longing to peer into it. I began walking, therefore, in a big curve, seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand heaps that hid these new-comers to our earth. Once a leash of thin black whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was immediately with- drawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling motion. What could be going on there? Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups --one a little crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the direction of Chobham. Evidently they shared my mental conflict. There were few near me. One man I approached--he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine, though I did not know his name--and accosted. But it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation. ""What ugly brutes!"" he said. ""Good God! What ugly brutes!"" He repeated this over and over again. ""Did you see a man in the pit?"" I said; but he made no answer to that. We became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side, deriving, I fancy, a certain comfort in one another's company. Then I shifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more of eleva- tion and when I looked for him presently he was walking towards Woking. The sunset faded to twilight before anything further hap- pened. The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham 20 The War of the Worlds dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit. It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence. At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a move- ment that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the eve- ning about the cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit. Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",8,"men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag. This was the Deputation. There had been a hasty consulta- tion, and since the Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms, intelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, by approaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent. Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the left. It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards I learned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this attempt at communication. This little group had in its advance dragged inward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost complete circle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed it at discreet distances. Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove up, one after the other, straight into the still air. This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their dispersal. At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible. Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at 21 The War of the Worlds its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small vertical black shapes upon the black ground. As the green smoke arose, their faces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished. Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud, droning noise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it. Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to another, sprang from the scattered group of men. It was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame. It was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire. Then, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering and falling, and their supporters turning to run. I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping from man to man in that little distant crowd. All I felt was that it was something very strange. An almost noise- less and blinding flash of light, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft of heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames. And far away towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden buildings suddenly set alight. It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death, this invisible, inevitable sword of heat. I perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied to stir. I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled. Then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out on the common. Forth- with the hissing and humming ceased, and the black, dome- like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit. All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise. But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark and un- 22 The War of the Worlds familiar. The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except where its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early night. It was dark, and sud- denly void of men. Overhead the stars were mustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale, bright, almost greenish blue. The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came out sharp and black against the western afterglow. The Mar- tians and their appliances were altogether invisible, save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirror wobbled. Patches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and glowed still, and the houses towards Woking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of the evening",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",9,"air. Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonish- ment. The little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out of existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me, had scarcely been broken. It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless, unprotected, and alone. Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from without, came--fear. With an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through the heather. The fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only of the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me. Such an extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping silently as a child might do. Once I had turned, I did not dare to look back. I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being played with, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety, this mysterious death--as swift as the passage of light--would leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down. 23 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER SIX THE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently. Many think that in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute non- conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light. But no one has absolutely proved these details. However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence of the matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light. Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon water, incontinently that explodes into steam. That night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit, charred and distorted beyond recognition, and all night long the common from Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze. The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and Ottershaw about the same time. In Woking the shops had closed when the tragedy happened, and a number of people, shop people and so forth, attracted by the stories they had heard, were walking over the Horsell Bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon the common. You may imagine the young people brushed up after the labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they would make any novelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial flirtation. You may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road in the gloaming. . . . As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder had opened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the post office with a special wire to an evening paper. As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they found 24 The War of the Worlds little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning mirror over the sand pits, and the new-comers were, no doubt, soon infected by the excitement of the oc- casion. By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there may have been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place, besides those who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer. There were three policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing their best, under instructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter them from approaching the cylinder. There was some booing from those more thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an occasion for noise and horse-play. Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision, had telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians emerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange creatures from violence. After that they returned to lead that ill-fated advance. The description of their death, as it was seen by the crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three puffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame. But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine. Only the fact that a hummock of heathery sand inter- cepted the lower part of the Heat-Ray saved them. Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale. They saw the flashes and",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",10,"the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were, lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight. Then, with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam swung close over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech trees that line the road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows, firing the window frames, and bring- ing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner. In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, the panic- stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some moments. Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road, and single leaves like puffs of flame. Hats and dresses caught fire. Then came a crying from the common. There were shrieks and shouts, and suddenly a mounted 25 The War of the Worlds policeman came galloping through the confusion with his hands clasped over his head, screaming. ""They're coming!"" a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone was turning and pushing at those behind, in order to clear their way to Woking again. They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep. Where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd jammed, and a desperate struggle occurred. All that crowd did not escape; three persons at least, two women and a little boy, were crushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror and the darkness. 26 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER SEVEN HOW I REACHED HOME For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather. All about me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before it descended and smote me out of life. I came into the road between the crossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads. At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence of my emotion and of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside. That was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks. I fell and lay still. I must have remained there some time. I sat up, strangely perplexed. For a moment, perhaps, I could not clearly understand how I came there. My terror had fallen from me like a garment. My hat had gone, and my collar had burst away from its fastener. A few minutes before, there had only been three real things before me--the immensity of the night and space and nature, my own feeble- ness and anguish, and the near approach of death. Now it was as if something turned over, and the point of view altered abruptly. There was no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other. I was immediately the self of every day again--a decent, ordinary citizen. The silent common, the impulse of my flight, the starting flames, were as if they had been in a dream. I asked myself had these latter things indeed happened? I could not credit it. I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge. My mind was blank wonder. My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their strength. I dare say I staggered drunkenly. A head rose over the arch, and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared. Beside him ran a little boy. He passed me, wishing me good night. I was minded to speak to him, but did not. I answered his greeting with a meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge. 27 The War of the Worlds Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of white, firelit smoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows, went flying south-- clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone. A dim group of people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little row of gables that was called Oriental Terrace. It was all so real and so familiar. And that behind me! It was frantic, fantastic! Such things, I told myself, could not be. Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods. I do not know how far my experience is common. At times I suffer from the strangest sense of detachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it all from the outside, from some- where inconceivably remote, out of time, out of space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all. This feeling was very strong upon me that night. Here was another side to my dream. But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the swift death flying yonder, not two miles away.",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",11,"There was a noise of business from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight. I stopped at the group of people. ""What news from the common?"" said I. There were two men and a woman at the gate. ""Eh?"" said one of the men, turning. ""What news from the common?"" I said. ""'Ain't yer just BEEN there?"" asked the men. ""People seem fair silly about the common,"" said the woman over the gate. ""What's it all abart?"" ""Haven't you heard of the men from Mars?"" said I; ""the creatures from Mars?"" ""Quite enough,"" said the woman over the gate. ""Thenks""; and all three of them laughed. I felt foolish and angry. I tried and found I could not tell them what I had seen. They laughed again at my broken sentences. ""You'll hear more yet,"" I said, and went on to my home. I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I. I went into the dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could collect myself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen. The dinner, which was a cold one, had already been served, and remained neglected on the table 28 The War of the Worlds while I told my story. ""There is one thing,"" I said, to allay the fears I had aroused; ""they are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl. They may keep the pit and kill people who come near them, but they cannot get out of it. . . . But the horror of them!"" ""Don't, dear!"" said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her hand on mine. ""Poor Ogilvy!"" I said. ""To think he may be lying dead there!"" My wife at least did not find my experience incredible. When I saw how deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly. ""They may come here,"" she said again and again. I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her. ""They can scarcely move,"" I said. I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had told me of the impossibility of the Martians estab- lishing themselves on the earth. In particular I laid stress on the gravitational difficulty. On the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is on the surface of Mars. A Martian, therefore, would weigh three times more than on Mars, albeit his muscular strength would be the same. His own body would be a cope of lead to him. That, indeed, was the general opinion. Both THE TIMES and the DAILY TELEGRAPH, for instance, insisted on it the next morning, and both overlooked, just as I did, two obvious modifying influ- ences. The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen or far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars. The invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their bodies. And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact that such mechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch. But I did not consider these points at the time, and so my reasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders. With wine and food, the confidence of my own table, and the necessity of reassuring my wife, I grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure. 29 The War of the Worlds ""They have done a foolish thing,"" said I, fingering my wineglass. ""They are dangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror. Perhaps they expected to find no living things--certainly no intelligent living things. ""A shell in the pit"" said I, ""if the worst comes to the worst will kill them all."" The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive powers in a state of erethism. I remember that dinner table with extraordinary vividness even now. My dear wife's sweet anxious face peering at me from under the pink lamp shade, the white cloth with its silver and glass table furniture--for in those days even philosophical writers had many little luxuries--the crimson-purple wine in my glass, are photographically distinct. At the end of it I sat, temper- ing nuts with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy's rashness, and denouncing the shortsighted timidity of the Martians. So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in his nest, and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in want of animal food. ""We will peck them to death tomorrow, my dear."" I did not know it, but that was the last civilised dinner I was to eat for very many strange and terrible days. 30 The War of the Worlds",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",12,"CHAPTER EIGHT FRIDAY NIGHT The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and wonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing of the commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong. If on Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the Woking sand pits, I doubt if you would have had one human being outside it, unless it were some relation of Stent or of the three or four cyclists or London people lying dead on the common, whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the new-comers. Many people had heard of the cylinder, of course, and talked about it in their leisure, but it certainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to Germany would have done. In London that night poor Henderson's telegram describing the gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and his evening paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no reply--the man was killed--decided not to print a special edition. Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were inert. I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to whom I spoke. All over the district people were dining and supping; working men were gardening after the labours of the day, children were being put to bed, young people were wandering through the lanes love- making, stu- dents sat over their books. Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel and dominant topic in the public-houses, and here and there a messenger, or even an eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of excitement, a shouting, and a running to and fro; but for the most part the daily routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on as it had done for count- less years--as though no planet Mars existed in the sky. Even at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was the case. In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping and going 31 The War of the Worlds on, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers were alighting and waiting, and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way. A boy from the town, trenching on Smith's monopoly, was selling papers with the afternoon's news. The ringing impact of trucks, the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction, mingled with their shouts of ""Men from Mars!"" Excited men came into the station about nine o'clock with incredible tidings, and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might have done. People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark dance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious than a heath fire was happening. It was only round the edge of the common that any disturbance was perceptible. There were half a dozen villas burning on the Woking border. There were lights in all the houses on the common side of the three villages, and the people there kept awake till dawn. A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but the crowd remaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges. One or two adventurous souls, it was after- wards found, went into the darkness and crawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned, for now and again a light-ray, like the beam of a warship's searchlight swept the common, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow. Save for such, that big area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay about on it all night under the stars, and all the next day. A noise of hammering from the pit was heard by many people. So you have the state of things on Friday night. In the centre, sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart, was this cylinder. But the poison was scarcely working yet. Around it was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few dark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there. Here and there was a burning bush or tree. Beyond was a fringe of excitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept as yet. In the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed as it had flowed for immemorial years. The fever of war that would presently clog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain, had still to develop. 32 The War of the Worlds All night long the Martians were hammering and",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",13,"stirring, sleepless, indefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and ever and again a puff of greenish- white smoke whirled up to the starlit sky. About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and deployed along the edge of the common to form a cordon. Later a second company marched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of the common. Several officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on the common earlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be missing. The colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and was busy questioning the crowd at midnight. The military authorities were certainly alive to the seriousness of the busi- ness. About eleven, the next morning's papers were able to say, a squadron of hussars, two Maxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan regiment started from Aldershot. A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road, Woking, saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest. It had a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightness like summer lightning. This was the second cylinder. 33 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER NINE THE FIGHTING BEGINS Saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense. It was a day of lassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating barometer. I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in sleeping, and I rose early. I went into my garden before breakfast and stood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring but a lark. The milkman came as usual. I heard the rattle of his chariot and I went round to the side gate to ask the latest news. He told me that during the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that guns were expected. Then--a familiar, reassuring note--I heard a train running towards Woking. ""They aren't to be killed,"" said the milkman, ""if that can possibly be avoided."" I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then strolled in to breakfast. It was a most un- exceptional morning. My neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to destroy the Martians during the day. ""It's a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,"" he said. ""It would be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might learn a thing or two."" He came up to the fence and extended a handful of straw- berries, for his gardening was as generous as it was enthusi- astic. At the same time he told me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links. ""They say,"" said he, ""that there's another of those blessed things fallen there--number two. But one's enough, surely. This lot'll cost the insurance people a pretty penny before everything's settled."" He laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this. The woods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to me. ""They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick soil of pine needles and turf,"" he said, and then grew serious over ""poor Ogilvy."" After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down towards 34 The War of the Worlds the common. Under the railway bridge I found a group of soldiers-- sappers, I think, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf. They told me no one was allowed over the canal, and, looking along the road towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan men standing sentinel there. I talked with these soldiers for a time; I told them of my sight of the Martians on the previous evening. None of them had seen the Martians, and they had but the vaguest ideas of them, so that they plied me with questions. They said that they did not know who had authorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute had arisen at the Horse Guards. The ordinary sapper is a great deal better educated than the common soldier, and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness. I described the Heat-Ray to them, and they began to argue among themselves. ""Crawl up under cover and rush 'em, say I,"" said one. ""Get aht!,"" said another. ""What's cover against this 'ere 'eat? Sticks to cook yer! What we got to do is to go as near as the ground'll let us, and then drive a trench."" ""Blow yer trenches! You always want trenches; you ought to ha"" been born a rabbit Snippy."" ""'Ain't they got any necks, then?"" said",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",14,"a third, abruptly-- a little, contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe. I repeated my description. ""Octopuses,"" said he, ""that's what I calls 'em. Talk about fishers of men--fighters of fish it is this time!"" ""It ain't no murder killing beasts like that,"" said the first speaker. ""Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish 'em?"" said the little dark man. ""You carn tell what they might do."" ""Where's your shells?"" said the first speaker. ""There ain't no time. Do it in a rush, that's my tip, and do it at once."" So they discussed it. After a while I left them, and went on to the railway station to get as many morning papers as I could. But I will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning and of the longer afternoon. I did not succeed in getting a glimpse 35 The War of the Worlds of the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were in the hands of the military authorities. The soldiers I addressed didn't know anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy. I found people in the town quite secure again in the presence of the military, and I heard for the first time from Marshall, the tobacconist, that his son was among the dead on the common. The soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock up and leave their houses. I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took a cold bath in the afternoon. About half past four I went up to the railway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent, Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others. But there was little I didn't know. The Martians did not show an inch of themselves. They seemed busy in their pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous streamer of smoke. Apparently they were busy getting ready for a struggle. ""Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without success,"" was the stereo- typed formula of the papers. A sapper told me it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole. The Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the lowing of a cow. I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this preparation, greatly excited me. My imagination became bel- ligerent, and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came back. It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at that time. They seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs. About three o'clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals from Chertsey or Addlestone. I learned that the smouldering pine wood into which the second cylin- der had fallen was being shelled, in the hope of destroying that object before it opened. It was only about five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against the first body of Martians. About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon us, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately after 36 The War of the Worlds a gust of firing. Close on the heels of that came a violent rattling crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and, starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst into smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside it slide down into ruin. The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and the roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window. I and my wife stood amazed. Then I realised that the crest of Maybury Hill must be within range of the Martians"" Heat- Ray now that the college was cleared out of the way. At that I gripped my wife's arm, and without ceremony ran her out into the road. Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for. ""We can't possibly stay here,"" I said; and as I spoke the firing reopened for a moment upon the common. ""But where are we to go?"" said",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",15,"my wife in terror. I thought perplexed. Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead. ""Leatherhead!"" I shouted above the sudden noise. She looked away from me downhill. The people were coming out of their houses, astonished. ""How are we to get to Leatherhead?"" she said. Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge; three galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College; two others dismounted, and began running from house to house. The sun, shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees, seemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything. ""Stop here,"" said I; ""you are safe here""; and I started off at once for the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart. I ran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the hill would be moving. I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what was going on behind his house. A man stood with his back to me, talking to him. ""I must have a pound,"" said the landlord, ""and I've no one to drive it."" 37 The War of the Worlds ""I'll give you two,"" said I, over the stranger's shoulder. ""What for?"" ""And I'll bring it back by midnight,"" I said. ""Lord!"" said the landlord; ""what's the hurry? I'm selling my bit of a pig. Two pounds, and you bring it back? What's going on now?"" I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the dog cart. At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the landlord should leave his. I took care to have the cart there and then, drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife and servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such plate as we had, and so forth. The beech trees below the house were burning while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red. While I was occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came running up. He was going from house to house, warning peo- ple to leave. He was going on as I came out of my front door, lugging my treasures, done up in a tablecloth. I shouted after him: ""What news?"" He turned, stared, bawled something about ""crawling out in a thing like a dish cover,"" and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest. A sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment. I ran to my neighbour's door and rapped to satisfy myself of what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had locked up their house. I went in again, according to my promise, to get my servant's box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver's seat beside my wife. In another moment we were clear of the smoke and noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old Woking. In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign. I saw the doctor's cart ahead of me. At the bottom of the hill I turned my head to look at the hillside I was leaving. Thick streamers of black smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward. The smoke already extended far away to the east and west--to the By- fleet pine woods eastward, and to 38 The War of the Worlds Woking on the west. The road was dotted with people running towards us. And very faint now, but very distinct through the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that was presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles. Apparently the Mar- tians were setting fire to everything within range of their Heat-Ray. I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my attention to the horse. When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the black smoke. I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave him a loose rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that quivering tumult. I overtook and passed the doctor between Woking and Send. 39 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER TEN IN THE STORM Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill. The scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the hedges on either side were sweet and",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",16,"gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very peace- ful and still. We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supper with my cousins and commended my wife to their care. My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed oppressed with forebodings of evil. I talked to her reassuringly, pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheer heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in monosyllables. Had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night. Would that I had! Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted. For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day. Something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I had to return to Maybury that night. I was even afraid that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from Mars. I can best express my state of mind by saying that I wanted to be in at the death. It was nearly eleven when I started to return. The night was unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my cousins' house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as the day. Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us. My cousins' man lit both lamps. Happily, I knew the road intimately. My wife stood in the light of the doorway, and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart. Then abruptly she turned and went in, 40 The War of the Worlds leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good hap. I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife's fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians. At that time I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening's fighting. I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated the conflict. As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I returned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western horizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the sky. The driving clouds of the gathering thunder- storm mingled there with masses of black and red smoke. Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so the village showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an accident at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of people stood with their backs to me. They said nothing to me as I passed. I do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill, nor do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping securely, or deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the terror of the night. From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the Wey, and the red glare was hidden from me. As I ascended the little hill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again, and the trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was upon me. Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church behind me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with its tree- tops and roofs black and sharp against the red. Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and showed the distant woods towards Addlestone. I felt a tug at the reins. I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the field to my left. It was the third falling star! Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced out the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst like a rocket overhead. The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted. A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down this we clattered. Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as rapid a 41 The War of the Worlds succession of flashes as I have ever seen. The thunderclaps, treading one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment, sounded more like the working of",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",17,"a gigantic electric machine than the usual detonating reverberations. The flickering light was blinding and confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as I drove down the slope. At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill. At first I took it for the wet roof of a house, but one flash following another showed it to be in swift rolling movement. It was an elusive vision--a moment of bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red masses of the Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright. And this Thing I saw! How can I describe it? A monstrous tripod, higher than many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and smashing them aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal, striding now across the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder. A flash, and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards nearer. Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression those instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand. Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted, as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were snapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared, rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me. And I was galloping hard to meet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether. Not stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse's head hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of water. 42 The War of the Worlds I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in the water, under a clump of furze. The horse lay motionless (his neck was broken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly. In another moment the colossal mechanism went striding by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford. Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere insensate machine driving on its way. Machine it was, with a ringing metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange body. It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a head looking about. Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman's basket, and puffs of green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me. And in an instant it was gone. So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows. As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the thunder--""Aloo! Aloo!""--and in another minute it was with its companion, half a mile away, stooping over something in the field. I have no doubt this Thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us from Mars. For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, by the intermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the distance over the hedge tops. A thin hail was now beginning, and as it came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness again. Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and the night swallowed them up. I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below. It was some time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril. Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter's hut of wood, surrounded by a patch of potato garden. I struggled to my feet at last, and, crouching and making use of every chance of cover, I made a run for this. 43 The War of the Worlds I hammered at the door, but I",no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",18,"could not make the people hear (if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted, and, availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way, succeeded in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into the pine woods towards Maybury. Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my own house. I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath. It was very dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming infrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage. If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I should have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead. But that night the strangeness of things about me, and my physical wretchedness, prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin, deafened and blinded by the storm. I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as much motive as I had. I staggered through the trees, fell into a ditch and bruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out into the lane that ran down from the College Arms. I say splashed, for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent. There in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling back. He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before I could gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him. So heavy was the stress of the storm just at this place that I had the hardest task to win my way up the hill. I went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way along its palings. Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of lightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broad- cloth and a pair of boots. Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, the flicker of light had passed. I stood over him waiting for the next flash. When it came, I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily dressed; his head was bent under his body, and he lay crumpled up close to the fence, as though he had been flung violently against it. 44 The War of the Worlds Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a dead body, I stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart. He was quite dead. Apparently his neck had been broken. The lightning flashed for a third time, and his face leaped upon me. I sprang to my feet. It was the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose conveyance I had taken. I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill. I made my way by the police station and the College Arms towards my own house. Nothing was burning on the hillside, though from the common there still came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the drench- ing hail. So far as I could see by the flashes, the houses about me were mostly uninjured. By the College Arms a dark heap lay in the road. Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the sound of feet, but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them. I let myself in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door, staggered to the foot of the staircase, and sat down. My imagination was full of those striding metallic monsters, and of the dead body smashed against the fence. I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall, shivering violently. 45 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER ELEVEN AT THE WINDOW I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of exhausting themselves. After a time I discovered that I was cold and wet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet. I got up almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank some whiskey, and then I was moved to change my clothes. After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so I do not know. The window of my study looks over the trees and the railway towards Horsell Common. In the hurry of our departure this window had been left open. The passage was dark, and, by contrast with the picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed im- penetrably dark. I stopped short in the",no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",19,"doorway. The thunderstorm had passed. The towers of the Oriental College and the pine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by a vivid red glare, the common about the sand pits was visible. Across the light huge black shapes, gro- tesque and strange, moved busily to and fro. It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on fire- -a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and writhing with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red reflection upon the cloud scud above. Every now and then a haze of smoke from some nearer conflagra- tion drove across the window and hid the Martian shapes. I could not see what they were doing, nor the clear form of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon. Neither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections of it danced on the wall and ceiling of the study. A sharp, resinous tang of burning was in the air. I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window. As I did so, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it reached to the houses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred and blackened pine woods of Byfleet. There was a light down below the hill, on the railway, near the arch, and several of the houses along the Maybury road and the 46 The War of the Worlds streets near the station were glowing ruins. The light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black heap and a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs. Then I perceived this was a wrecked train, the fore part smashed and on fire, the hinder carriages still upon the rails. Between these three main centres of light--the houses, the train, and the burning county towards Chobham-- stretched irregular patches of dark country, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and smoking ground. It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set with fire. It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries at night. At first I could distinguish no people at all, though I peered intently for them. Later I saw against the light of Woking station a number of black figures hurrying one after the other across the line. And this was the little world in which I had been living securely for years, this fiery chaos! What had happened in the last seven hours I still did not know; nor did I know, though I was beginning to guess, the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps I had seen dis- gorged from the cylinder. With a queer feeling of impersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down, and stared at the blackened country, and particularly at the three gigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare about the sand pits. They seemed amazingly busy. I began to ask myself what they could be. Were they intelligent mechanisms? Such a thing I felt was impossible. Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing, using, much as a man's brain sits and rules in his body? I began to compare the things to human ma- chines, to ask myself for the first time in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal. The storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burning land the little fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west, when a soldier came into my garden. I heard a slight scraping at the fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I looked down and saw him dimly, clambering over the palings. At the sight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out of the window eagerly. ""Hist!"" said I, in a whisper. 47 The War of the Worlds He stopped astride of the fence in doubt. Then he came over and across the lawn to the corner of the house. He bent down and stepped softly. ""Who's there?"" he said, also whispering, standing under the window and peering up. ""Where are you going?"" I asked. ""God knows."" ""Are you trying to hide?"" ""That's it."" ""Come into the house,"" I said. I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked the door again. I could not see his face. He was hatless, and his coat was unbuttoned. ""My God!"" he said, as I drew him in. ""What has happened?"" I asked. ""What hasn't?"" In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of despair. ""They wiped us out--simply wiped us out,"" he",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",20,"repeated again and again. He followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining room. ""Take some whiskey,"" I said, pouring out a stiff dose. He drank it. Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put his head on his arms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in a perfect passion of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of my own recent despair, stood beside him, wondering. It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my questions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly. He was a driver in the artillery, and had only come into action about seven. At that time firing was going on across the common, and it was said the first party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second cylinder under cover of a metal shield. Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of the fighting-machines I had seen. The gun he drove had been unlimbered near Horsell, in order to com- mand the sand pits, and its arrival it was that had precipi- tated the action. As the limber gunners went to the rear, his 48 The War of the Worlds horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down, throwing him into a depression of the ground. At the same moment the gun exploded behind him, the ammunition blew up, there was fire all about him, and he found himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses. ""I lay still,"" he said, ""scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter of a horse atop of me. We'd been wiped out. And the smell--good God! Like burnt meat! I was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse, and there I had to lie until I felt better. Just like parade it had been a minute before-- then stumble, bang, swish!"" ""Wiped out!"" he said. He had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping out furtively across the common. The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in skirmishing order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence. Then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the common among the few fugitives, with its headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being. A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case, about which green flashes scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked the Heat-Ray. In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a living thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it that was not already a blackened skeleton was burning. The hussars had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw nothing of them. He heard the Martians rattle for a time and then become still. The giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses until the last; then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and the town became a heap of fiery ruins. Then the Thing shut off the Heat-Ray, and turning its back upon the artillery- man, began to waddle away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder. As it did so a second glittering Titan built itself up out of the pit. The second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards Horsell. He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the road, and so escaped to Woking. There his story became ejaculatory. The place was impassable. It seems there were a few people alive there, frantic for the 49 The War of the Worlds most part and many burned and scalded. He was turned aside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken wall as one of the Martian giants returned. He saw this one pursue a man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knock his head against the trunk of a pine tree. At last, after nightfall, the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment. Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope of getting out of danger Londonward. People were hiding in trenches and cellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking village and Send. He had been consumed with thirst until he found one of the water mains near the railway arch smashed, and the water bubbling out like a spring upon the road. That was the story I got from him, bit by bit. He grew calmer telling me and trying to make me",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",21,"see the things he had seen. He had eaten no food since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and I found some mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the room. We lit no lamp for fear of attracting the Martians, and ever and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat. As he talked, things about us came darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew dis- tinct. It would seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn. I began to see his face, blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was also. When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study, and I looked again out of the open window. In one night the valley had become a valley of ashes. The fires had dwindled now. Where flames had been there were now streamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn. Yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape--a white railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse there, white and fresh amid the wreckage. Never before in the history of warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal. And shining with the growing light of the east, three of the metallic giants stood about the pit, their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the desolation they had made. 50 The War of the Worlds It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the brightening dawn--streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished. Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham. They became pillars of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day. 51 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER TWELVE WHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the win- dow from which we had watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs. The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in. He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin his battery--No. 12, of the Horse Artillery. My plan was to return at once to Leather- head; and so greatly had the strength of the Martians im- pressed me that I had determined to take my wife to New- haven, and go with her out of the country forthwith. For I already perceived clearly that the country about London must inevitably be the scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed. Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylin- der, with its guarding giants. Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my chance and struck across country. But the artilleryman dissuaded me: ""It's no kindness to the right sort of wife,"" he said, ""to make her a widow""; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the woods, northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him. Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead. I should have started at once, but my companion had been in active service and he knew better than that. He made me ransack the house for a flask, which he filled with whiskey; and we lined every available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat. Then we crept out of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by which I had come overnight. The houses seemed deserted. In the road lay a group of three charred bodies close together, struck dead by the Heat-Ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped--a clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the like poor valuables. At the corner turning up towards the post office a little cart, filled with boxes and furniture, and horseless, heeled over on a broken wheel. A cash box had been hastily smashed open 52 The War of the Worlds and thrown under the debris. Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none of the houses had suffered very greatly here. The Heat- Ray had shaved the chimney tops and passed. Yet, save our- selves, there did not seem to be a living soul on Maybury Hill. The majority of the inhabitants had escaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road--the road I had taken when I drove to Leatherhead--or they had hidden. We went down the lane, by the body of the",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",22,"man in black, sodden now from the overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill. We pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul. The woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of woods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain proportion still stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliage instead of green. On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it had failed to secure its footing. In one place the woodmen had been at work on Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a clearing, with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine. Hard by was a tem- porary hut, deserted. There was not a breath of wind this morning, and everything was strangely still. Even the birds were hushed, and as we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders. Once or twice we stopped to listen. After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers riding slowly towards Woking. We hailed them, and they halted while we hurried towards them. It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of the 8th Hus- sars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the artilleryman told me was a heliograph. ""You are the first men I've seen coming this way this morn- ing,"" said the lieutenant. ""What's brewing?"" His voice and face were eager. The men behind him stared curiously. The artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted. ""Gun destroyed last night, sir. Have been hiding. Trying to rejoin battery, sir. You'll come in sight of the Martians, I expect, about half a mile along this road."" 53 The War of the Worlds ""What the dickens are they like?"" asked the lieutenant. ""Giants in armour, sir. Hundred feet high. Three legs and a body like 'luminium, with a mighty great head in a hood, sir."" ""Get out!"" said the lieutenant. ""What confounded non- sense!"" ""You'll see, sir. They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fire and strikes you dead."" ""What d'ye mean--a gun?"" ""No, sir,"" and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray. Halfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me. I was still standing on the bank by the side of the road. ""It's perfectly true,"" I said. ""Well,"" said the lieutenant, ""I suppose it's my business to see it too. Look here""--to the artilleryman--""we're detailed here clearing people out of their houses. You'd better go along and report yourself to Brigadier- General Marvin, and tell him all you know. He's at Weybridge. Know the way?"" ""I do,"" I said; and he turned his horse southward again. ""Half a mile, you say?"" said he. ""At most,"" I answered, and pointed over the treetops south- ward. He thanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more. Farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in the road, busy clearing out a labourer's cot- tage. They had got hold of a little hand truck, and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture. They were all too assiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed. By Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and found the country calm and peaceful under the morning sun- light. We were far beyond the range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been for the silent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring movement of packing in others, and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over the railway and staring down the line towards Woking, the day would have seemed very like any other Sunday. Several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road to Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw, across a 54 The War of the Worlds stretch of flat meadow, six twelve- pounders standing neatly at equal distances pointing towards Woking. The gunners stood by the guns waiting, and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance. The men stood almost as if under inspection. ""That's good!"" said I. ""They will get one fair shot, at any rate."" The artilleryman hesitated at the gate. ""I shall go on,"" he said. Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and more guns behind. ""It's bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,"" said the artilleryman. ""They 'aven't seen that fire-beam yet."" The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",23,"the treetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every now and again to stare in the same direc- tion. Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars, some of them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about. Three or four black government wag- gons, with crosses in white circles, and an old omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the village street. There were scores of people, most of them sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes. The soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their position. We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids, angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind. I stopped and gripped his arm. ""Do you know what's over there?"" I said, pointing at the pine tops that hid the Martians. ""Eh?"" said he, turning. ""I was explainin"" these is vallyble."" ""Death!"" I shouted. ""Death is coming! Death!"" and leaving him to digest that if he could, I hurried on after the artillery- man. At the corner I looked back. The soldier had left him, and he was still standing by his box, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and staring vaguely over the trees. No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were established; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen in 55 The War of the Worlds any town before. Carts, carriages every- where, the most astonishing miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh. The respectable inhabitants of the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily dressed, were pack- ing, river-side loafers energetically helping, children excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this astonishing variation of their Sunday experiences. In the midst of it all the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebra- tion, and his bell was jangling out above the excitement. I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking fountain, made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us. Patrols of soldiers--here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in white--were warning people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the firing began. We saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station, and the swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages. The ordinary traffic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey, and I have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at a later hour. We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames join. Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little cart. The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are to be hired, and there was a ferry across the river. On the Shepperton side was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of Shepperton Church --it has been replaced by a spire--rose above the trees. Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives. As yet the flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more people than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross. People came panting along under heavy bur- dens; one husband and wife were even carrying a small out- house door between them, with some of their household goods piled thereon. One man told us he meant to try to get away from Shepperton station. There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting. The idea people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply formidable 56 The War of the Worlds human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be certainly destroyed in the end. Every now and then people would glance nervously across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything over there was still. Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything was quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side. The people who landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane. The big ferryboat had just made a journey. Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to help. The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited hours. ""What's that?"" cried a boatman, and ""Shut up, you fool!"" said a man near me to a yelping dog. Then the",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",24,"sound came again, this time from the direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud--the sound of a gun. The fighting was beginning. Almost immediately unseen batteries across the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up the chorus, firing heavily one after the other. A woman screamed. Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet invisible to us. Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless in the warm sunlight. ""The sojers'll stop 'em,"" said a woman beside me, doubt- fully. A haziness rose over the treetops. Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished. ""Here they are!"" shouted a man in a blue jersey. ""Yonder! D'yer see them? Yonder!"" Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured Martians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly towards the river. Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds. Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth. Their armoured 57 The War of the Worlds bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer. One on the extreme left, the remotest that is, flour- ished a huge case high in the air, and the ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night smote towards Chertsey, and struck the town. At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd near the water's edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck. There was no screaming or shouting, but a silence. Then a hoarse murmur and a movement of feet--a splashing from the water. A man, too frightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden. A woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me. I turned with the rush of the people, but I was not too terrified for thought. The terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind. To get under water! That was it! ""Get under water!"" I shouted, unheeded. I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian, rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water. Others did the same. A boatload of people putting back came leaping out as I rushed past. The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery, and the river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep. Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred yards away, I flung myself forward under the sur- face. The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears. People were landing hastily on both sides of the river. But the Martian machine took no more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked. When, half suffocated, I raised my head above water, the Martian's hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river, and as it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the Heat-Ray. In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wad- ing halfway across. The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank, and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height again, close to the village of Shepperton. Forthwith the six guns which, unknown to anyone 58 The War of the Worlds on the right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts of that village, fired simultaneously. The sudden near concussion, the last close upon the first, made my heart jump. The monster was already raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the first shell burst six yards above the hood. I gave a cry of astonishment. I saw and thought nothing of the other four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer incident. Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the body as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to dodge, the fourth shell. The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing. The hood bulged, flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered frag- ments of red flesh and glittering metal.

"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",25,"I, with something between a scream and a cheer. I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me. I could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation. The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did not fall over. It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shep- perton. The living intelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed to the four winds of heaven, and the Thing was now but a mere intricate device of metal whirling to destruction. It drove along in a straight line, incapable of guidance. It struck the tower of Shepperton Church, smash- ing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done, swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tre- mendous force into the river out of my sight. A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water, steam, mud, and shattered metal shot far up into the sky. As the camera of the Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into steam. In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream. I saw people struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting faintly above the seething and roar of the Martian's collapse. For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need of self-preservation. I splashed through the tu- multuous water, pushing aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the bend. Half a dozen 59 The War of the Worlds deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves. The fallen Martian came into sight downstream, lying across the river, and for the most part submerged. Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through the tumultuously whirling wisps I could see, inter- mittently and vaguely, the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray of mud and froth into the air. The tentacles swayed and struck like living arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness of these movements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for its life amid the waves. Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid were spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine. My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling, like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns. A man, knee-deep near the towing path, shouted inaudibly to me and pointed. Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with gigantic strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey. The Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly. At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until movement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as long as I could. The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly growing hotter. When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the hair and water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white fog that at first hid the Martians alto- gether. The noise was deafening. Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified by the mist. They had passed by me, and two were stooping over the frothing, tu- multuous ruins of their comrade. The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two hundred yards from me, the other towards Lale- ham. The generators of the Heat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this way and that. The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing con- flict of noises--the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling and 60 The War of the Worlds roaring of fire. Dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white, that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames. The nearer houses still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint and pallid in the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro. For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almost boiling water, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape. Through the reek I could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out of the water through the reeds, like little frogs hurrying through grass from the advance of a man, or running to and fro in utter dismay on the towing path. Then",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",26,"suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping towards me. The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and darted out flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar. The Ray flickered up and down the towing path, licking off the people who ran this way and that, and came down to the water's edge not fifty yards from where I stood. It swept across the river to Shepperton, and the water in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam. I turned shoreward. In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling- point had rushed upon me. I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded, agonised, I staggered through the leaping, hiss- ing water towards the shore. Had my foot stumbled, it would have been the end. I fell helplessly, in full sight of the Mar- tians, upon the broad, bare gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames. I expected nothing but death. I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a score of yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel, whirling it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense, and then of the four carry- ing the debris of their comrade between them, now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke, receding interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of river and meadow. And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracle I had escaped. 61 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER THIRTEEN HOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATE After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terres- trial weapons, the Martians retreated to their original position upon Horsell Common; and in their haste, and encumbered with the de'bris of their smashed companion, they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible victim as myself. Had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith, there was nothing at that time between them and London but batteries of twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly have reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach; as sudden, dreadful, and destructive their advent would have been as the earthquake that destroyed Lisbon a century ago. But they were in no hurry. Cylinder followed cylinder on its interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them reinforcement. And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, now fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked with furious energy. Every minute a fresh gun came into position until, before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black muzzle. And through the charred and desolated area--perhaps twenty square miles altogether--that encircled the Martian encamp- ment on Horsell Common, through charred and ruined villages among the green trees, through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach. But the Mar- tians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder, save at the price of his life. It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon in going to and fro, transferring everything from the second and third cylinders--the second in Addle- stone Golf Links and the third at Pyrford-- 62 The War of the Worlds to their original pit on Horsell Common. Over that, above the blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide, stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast fighting-machines and descended into the pit. They were hard at work there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs. And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next sally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning Weybridge towards London. I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down- stream; and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it, gained it, and so escaped out of that destruction. There were no oars in the boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled hands would allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going very tediously and continually looking behind me, as you may well under- stand. I followed the river, because I considered that the water gave me my best chance of",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",27,"escape should these giants return. The hot water from the Martian's overthrow drifted down- stream with me, so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either bank. Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying across the meadows from the direction of Weybridge. Halliford, it seemed, was deserted, and sev- eral of the houses facing the river were on fire. It was strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite desolate under the hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon. Never before had I seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd. A little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay. For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after the violence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon the water. Then my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling. The sun scorched my bare back. At last, as the bridge at Walton was coming into 63 The War of the Worlds sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my fears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick, amid the long grass. I suppose the time was then about four or five o'clock. I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile with- out meeting a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge. I seem to remember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last spurt. I was also very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no more water. It is a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I cannot account for it, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me excessively. I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably I dozed. I became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged shirt sleeves, and with his upturned, clean- shaven face staring at a faint flickering that danced over the sky. The sky was what is called a mackerel sky--rows and rows of faint down-plumes of cloud, just tinted with the midsummer sunset. I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly. ""Have you any water?"" I asked abruptly. He shook his head. ""You have been asking for water for the last hour,"" he said. For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other. I dare say he found me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my water-soaked trousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders blackened by the smoke. His face was a fair weakness, his chin retreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring. He spoke abruptly, looking vacantly away from me. ""What does it mean?"" he said. ""What do these things mean?"" I stared at him and made no answer. He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone. ""Why are these things permitted? What sins have we done? The morning service was over, I was walking through the roads to clear my brain for the afternoon, and then--fire, earthquake, death! As if it were Sodom and Gomorrah! All our work undone, all the work---- What are 64 The War of the Worlds these Mar- tians?"" ""What are we?"" I answered, clearing my throat. He gripped his knees and turned to look at me again. For half a minute, perhaps, he stared silently. ""I was walking through the roads to clear my brain,"" he said. ""And suddenly--fire, earthquake, death!"" He relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost to his knees. Presently he began waving his hand. ""All the work--all the Sunday schools---- What have we done--what has Weybridge done? Everything gone--every- thing destroyed. The church! We rebuilt it only three years ago. Gone! Swept out of existence! Why?"" Another pause, and he broke out again like one de- mented. ""The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!"" he shouted. His eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in the direc- tion of Weybridge. By this time I was beginning to take his measure. The tremendous tragedy in which he had been involved--it was evident he was a fugitive from Weybridge--had driven him to the very verge of his reason. ""Are we far from Sunbury?"" I said, in a matter-of-fact tone. ""What are we to do?"" he asked. ""Are these creatures every- where? Has the earth been given over to them?"" ""Are we far",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",28,"from Sunbury?"" ""Only this morning I officiated at early celebration----"" ""Things have changed,"" I said, quietly. ""You must keep your head. There is still hope."" ""Hope!"" ""Yes. Plentiful hope--for all this destruction!"" I began to explain my view of our position. He listened at first, but as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their former stare, and his regard wandered from me. ""This must be the beginning of the end,"" he said, inter- rupting me. ""The end! The great and terrible day of the Lord! When men shall call 65 The War of the Worlds upon the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide them--hide them from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne!"" I began to understand the position. I ceased my laboured reasoning, struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid my hand on his shoulder. ""Be a man!"" said I. ""You are scared out of your wits! What good is religion if it collapses under calamity? Think of what earthquakes and floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before to men! Did you think God had exempted Weybridge? He is not an insurance agent."" For a time he sat in blank silence. ""But how can we escape?"" he asked, suddenly. ""They are invulnerable, they are pitiless."" ""Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,"" I answered. ""And the mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be. One of them was killed yonder not three hours ago."" ""Killed!"" he said, staring about him. ""How can God's min- isters be killed?"" ""I saw it happen."" I proceeded to tell him. ""We have chanced to come in for the thick of it,"" said I, ""and that is all."" ""What is that flicker in the sky?"" he asked abruptly. I told him it was the heliograph signalling--that it was the sign of human help and effort in the sky. ""We are in the midst of it,"" I said, ""quiet as it is. That flicker in the sky tells of the gathering storm. Yonder, I take it are the Martians, and Londonward, where those hills rise about Richmond and Kingston and the trees give cover, earth- works are being thrown up and guns are being placed. Pres- ently the Martians will be coming this way again."" And even as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture. ""Listen!"" he said. From beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance of distant guns and a remote weird crying. Then everything was still. A cockchafer came droning over the hedge and past us. High in the west the crescent moon hung faint and pale above the smoke of Weybridge and Shepper- ton and the hot, still splendour of the sunset. 66 The War of the Worlds ""We had better follow this path,"" I said, ""northward."" 67 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER FOURTEEN IN LONDON My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking. He was a medical student working for an imminent examination, and he heard nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning. The morning papers on Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special articles on the planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and vaguely worded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity. The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran. The telegram concluded with the words: ""Formi- dable as they seem to be, the Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and, indeed, seem incapa- ble of doing so. Probably this is due to the relative strength of the earth's gravitational energy."" On that last text their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly. Of course all the students in the crammer's biology class, to which my brother went that day, were intensely interested, but there were no signs of any unusual excitement in the streets. The afternoon papers puffed scraps of news under big headlines. They had nothing to tell beyond the movements of troops about the common, and the burning of the pine woods between Woking and Weybridge, until eight. Then the ST. JAMES'S GAZETTE, in an extra-special edition, announced the bare fact of the interruption of telegraphic communica- tion. This was thought to be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line. Nothing more of the fighting was known that night, the night of my drive to Leatherhead and back. My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from the description in the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house. He made up his mind to run down that night to",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",29,"me, in order, as he says, to see the Things before they were killed. He despatched a telegram, which never 68 The War of the Worlds reached me, about four o'clock, and spent the evening at a music hall. In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunder- storm, and my brother reached Waterloo in a cab. On the platform from which the midnight train usually starts he learned, after some waiting, that an accident prevented trains from reaching Woking that night. The nature of the accident he could not ascertain; indeed, the railway authorities did not clearly know at that time. There was very little excitement in the station, as the officials, failing to realise that anything further than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction had occurred, were running the theatre trains which usually passed through Woking round by Virginia Water or Guildford. They were busy making the necessary arrange- ments to alter the route of the Southampton and Portsmouth Sunday League excursions. A nocturnal newspaper reporter, mistaking my brother for the traffic manager, to whom he bears a slight resemblance, waylaid and tried to interview him. Few people, excepting the railway officials, connected the breakdown with the Martians. I have read, in another account of these events, that on Sunday morning ""all London was electrified by the news from Woking."" As a matter of fact, there was nothing to justify that very extravagant phrase. Plenty of Londoners did not hear of the Martians until the panic of Monday morn- ing. Those who did took some time to realise all that the hastily worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed. The majority of people in London do not read Sunday papers. The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the Londoner's mind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of course in the papers, that they could read without any personal tremors: ""About seven o'clock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder, and, moving about under an armour of metallic shields, have completely wrecked Woking station with the adjacent houses, and massacred an entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment. No details are known. Maxims have been absolutely useless against their armour; the field guns have been disabled by them. Flying hussars have been galloping into Chertsey. The Martians appear to be moving slowly towards Chertsey or Windsor. Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, and earthworks are being thrown up to 69 The War of the Worlds check the advance Londonward."" That was how the Sunday SUN put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt ""handbook"" article in the REFEREE compared the affair to a menagerie suddenly let loose in a village. No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured Martians, and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be sluggish: ""crawling,"" ""creeping painfully"" --such expressions occurred in almost all the earlier reports. None of the telegrams could have been written by an eye- witness of their advance. The Sunday papers printed separate editions as further news came to hand, some even in default of it. But there was practically nothing more to tell people until late in the afternoon, when the authorities gave the press agencies the news in their possession. It was stated that the people of Walton and Weybridge, and all the district were pouring along the roads Londonward, and that was all. My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning, still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night. There he heard allusions made to the invasion, and a special prayer for peace. Coming out, he bought a REFEREE. He became alarmed at the news in this, and went again to Waterloo station to find out if communication were restored. The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and innumerable people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by the strange intelligence that the news venders were dis- seminating. People were interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed only on account of the local residents. At the station he heard for the first time that the Windsor and Chertsey lines were now interrupted. The porters told him that several remark- able telegrams had been received in the morning from Byfleet and Chertsey stations, but that these had abruptly ceased. My brother could get very little precise detail out of them. ""There's fighting going on about Weybridge"" was the extent of their information. The train service was now very much disorganised. Quite a number of people who had been expecting friends from places on the South- Western network were standing about the station. One grey-headed old gentleman came and abused the South-Western Company bitterly to my brother. ""It wants showing up,"" he said. 70 The War of the Worlds One or two",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",30,"trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston, containing people who had gone out for a day's boating and found the locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air. A man in a blue and white blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings. ""There's hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts and things, with boxes of valuables and all that,"" he said. ""They come from Molesey and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there's been guns heard at Chertsey, heavy firing, and that mounted soldiers have told them to get off at once because the Martians are coming. We heard guns firing at Hampton Court station, but we thought it was thunder. What the dickens does it all mean? The Martians can't get out of their pit, can they?"" My brother could not tell him. Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the clients of the underground railway, and that the Sunday excursionists began to return from all over the South-Western ""lung""--Barnes, Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth--at unnaturally early hours; but not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of. Every- one connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered. About five o'clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely excited by the opening of the line of communica- tion, which is almost invariably closed, between the South- Eastern and the South-Western stations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and carriages crammed with soldiers. These were the guns that were brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston. There was an exchange of pleasantries: ""You'll get eaten!"" ""We're the beast-tamers!"" and so forth. A little while after that a squad of police came into the station and began to clear the public off the platforms, and my brother went out into the street again. The church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad of Salvation Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road. On the bridge a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the stream in patches. The sun was just setting, and the Clock Tower and the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it is possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred with long trans- verse stripes of 71 The War of the Worlds reddish-purple cloud. There was talk of a floating body. One of the men there, a reservist he said he was, told my brother he had seen the heliograph flickering in the west. In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still- wet newspapers and staring placards. ""Dreadful catastrophe!"" they bawled one to the other down Wellington Street. ""Fight ing at Weybridge! Full description! Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!"" He had to give threepence for a copy of that paper. Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full power and terror of these monsters. He learned that they were not merely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were minds swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand against them. They were described as ""vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred feet high, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot out a beam of intense heat."" Masked batter- ies, chiefly of field guns, had been planted in the country about Horsell Common, and especially between the Woking district and London. Five of the machines had been seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had been destroyed. In the other cases the shells had missed, and the batteries had been at once annihilated by the Heat- Rays. Heavy losses of soldiers were mentioned, but the tone of the despatch was optimistic. The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnera- ble. They had retreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in the circle about Woking. Signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon them from all sides. Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor, Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich-- even from the north; among others, long wire-guns of ninety- five tons from Woolwich. Altogether one hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed, chiefly covering Lon- don. Never before in England had there been such a vast or rapid concentration of military material. Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyed at once by high explosives, which were being rap- idly manufactured and 72 The War of the Worlds distributed. No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the strangest and gravest description, but the public was",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",31,"exhorted to avoid and discourage panic. No doubt the Martians were strange and terrible in the extreme, but at the outside there could not be more than twenty of them against our millions. The authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of the cylinders, that at the outside there could not be more than five in each cylinder-- fifteen altogether. And one at least was disposed of--perhaps more. The public would be fairly warned of the approach of danger, and elaborate measures were being taken for the protection of the people in the threatened southwestern suburbs. And so, with reiterated assurances of the safety of London and the ability of the authorities to cope with the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation closed. This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was still wet, and there had been no time to add a word of comment. It was curious, my brother said, to see how ruth- lessly the usual contents of the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place. All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out the pink sheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the voices of an army of hawkers following these pioneers. Men came scrambling off buses to secure copies. Certainly this news excited people intensely, whatever their previous apathy. The shutters of a map shop in the Strand were being taken down, my brother said, and a man in his Sunday raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visi- ble inside the window hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass. Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his hand, my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey. There was a man with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart such as greengrocers use. He was driving from the direction of Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles. The faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearance contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the people on the omnibuses. People in fash- ionable clothing peeped at them out of cabs. 73 The War of the Worlds They stopped at the Square as if undecided which way to take, and finally turned eastward along the Strand. Some way behind these came a man in workday clothes, riding one of those old- fashioned tricycles with a small front wheel. He was dirty and white in the face. My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a num- ber of such people. He had a vague idea that he might see something of me. He noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic. Some of the refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses. One was professing to have seen the Martians. ""Boilers on stilts, I tell you, striding along like men."" Most of them were excited and animated by their strange experience. Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with these arrivals. At all the street corners groups of people were reading papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday visitors. They seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last the roads, my brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day. My brother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers from most. None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man, who assured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous night. ""I come from Byfleet,"" he said; ""man on a bicycle came through the place in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning us to come away. Then came soldiers. We went out to look, and there were clouds of smoke to the south-- nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming that way. Then we heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from Wey- bridge. So I've locked up my house and come on."" At the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the invaders without all this inconvenience. About eight o'clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all over the south of London. My brother could not hear it for the traffic in the main thoroughfares, but by strik- ing through the quiet back streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly. He walked from Westminster to his apartments near Re- gent's Park, 74 The War of the Worlds about two. He was now very anxious on my account, and disturbed at the evident magnitude of the trouble. His mind was inclined",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",32,"to run, even as mine had run on Saturday, on military details. He thought of all those silent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside; he tried to imagine ""boilers on stilts"" a hundred feet high. There were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along Oxford Street, and several in the Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the news spreading that Regent Street and Port- land Place were full of their usual Sunday-night promenaders, albeit they talked in groups, and along the edge of Regent's Park there were as many silent couples ""walking out"" together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been. The night was warm and still, and a little oppressive; the sound of guns continued intermittently, and after midnight there seemed to be sheet lightning in the south. He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst had hap- pened to me. He was restless, and after supper prowled out again aimlessly. He returned and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination notes. He went to bed a little after midnight, and was awakened from lurid dreams in the small hours of Monday by the sound of door knockers, feet running in the street, distant drumming, and a clamour of bells. Red reflections danced on the ceiling. For a moment he lay astonished, wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad. Then he jumped out of bed and ran to the window. His room was an attic and as he thrust his head out, up and down the street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash, and heads in every kind of night disarray appeared. Enquiries were being shouted. ""They are coming!"" bawled a policeman, hammering at the door; ""the Martians are coming!"" and hurried to the next door. The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street Barracks, and every church within earshot was hard at work killing sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin. There was a noise of doors opening, and window after win- dow in the houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow illumination. Up the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptly into 75 The War of the Worlds noise at the corner, rising to a clattering climax under the window, and dying away slowly in the distance. Close on the rear of this came a couple of cabs, the forerun- ners of a long procession of flying vehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm station, where the North-Western special trains were loading up, instead of coming down the gradient into Euston. For a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank astonishment, watching the policemen hammering at door after door, and delivering their incomprehensible mes- sage. Then the door behind him opened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressed only in shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his waist, his hair disordered from his pillow. ""What the devil is it?"" he asked. ""A fire? What a devil of a row!"" They both craned their heads out of the window, straining to hear what the policemen were shouting. People were com- ing out of the side streets, and standing in groups at the corners talking. ""What the devil is it all about?"" said my brother's fellow lodger. My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running with each garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing excitement. And presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers came bawling into the street: ""London in danger of suffocation! The Kingston and Rich- mond defences forced! Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!"" And all about him--in the rooms below, in the houses on each side and across the road, and behind in the Park Ter- races and in the hundred other streets of that part of Maryle- bone, and the Westbourne Park district and St. Pancras, and westward and northward in Kilburn and St. John's Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed, through all the vastness of London from Ealing to East Ham--people were rubbing their eyes, and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions, dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through the streets. It was the dawn of the great panic. London, which had gone to bed on Sunday night oblivious and inert, was awakened, in the small hours of Monday morning, to a vivid sense of danger. 76 The War of the Worlds Unable from his window to learn what was happening, my brother went down and out into the street, just as the sky between the parapets of the houses grew pink with the early dawn.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",33,"The flying people on foot and in vehicles grew more numerous every moment. ""Black Smoke!"" he heard people crying, and again ""Black Smoke!"" The contagion of such a unanimous fear was inevitable. As my brother hesitated on the door-step, he saw another news vender approaching, and got a paper forthwith. The man was running away with the rest, and selling his papers for a shilling each as he ran--a grotesque mingling of profit and panic. And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic despatch of the Commander-in-Chief: ""The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and poisonous vapour by means of rockets. They have smothered our batteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and are advancing slowly towards London, de- stroying everything on the way. It is impossible to stop them. There is no safety from the Black Smoke but in instant flight."" That was all, but it was enough. The whole population of the great six-million city was stirring, slipping, running; pres- ently it would be pouring EN MASSE northward. ""Black Smoke!"" the voices cried. ""Fire!"" The bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult, a cart carelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water trough up the street. Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps. And overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm. He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down stairs behind him. His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in dressing gown and shawl; her hus- band followed ejaculating. As my brother began to realise the import of all these things, he turned hastily to his own room, put all his available money--some ten pounds altogether--into his pockets, and went out again into the streets. 77 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER FIFTEEN WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SURREY It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the Martians had resumed the of- fensive. So far as one can ascertain from the conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of them remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine that night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green smoke. But three certainly came out about eight o'clock and, advancing slowly and cautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Pyrford towards Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant batteries against the setting sun. These Martians did not advance in a body, but in a line, each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest fellow. They communicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls, running up and down the scale from one note to another. It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St. George's Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford. The Ripley gunners, unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been placed in such a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectual volley, and bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village, while the Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over their guns, stepped gin- gerly among them, passed in front of them, and so came unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he destroyed. The St. George's Hill men, however, were better led or of a better mettle. Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they seem to have been quite unsuspected by the Martian nearest to them. They laid their guns as deliberately as if they had been on parade, and fired at about a thousand yards' range. 78 The War of the Worlds The shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance a few paces, stagger, and go down. Everybody yelled together, and the guns were reloaded in frantic haste. The overthrown Martian set up a prolonged ululation, and imme- diately a second glittering giant, answering him, appeared over the trees to the south. It would seem that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells. The whole of the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground, and, simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat- Rays to bear on the battery. The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all about the guns flashed into fire, and only one or two of the men who were already running over the crest of the hill escaped. After this it would seem that the three took counsel to- gether and halted, and the scouts who were watching them report that they remained absolutely stationary for the next",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",34,"half hour. The Martian who had been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small brown figure, oddly sugges- tive from that distance of a speck of blight, and apparently engaged in the repair of his support. About nine he had finished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees again. It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels were joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick black tube. A similar tube was handed to each of the three, and the seven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between St. George's Hill, Weybridge, and the village of Send, southwest of Ripley. A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they began to move, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and Esher. At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly armed with tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against the western sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward out of Halliford. They moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a milky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height. At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began running; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I turned aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad ditch by the side of the road. He looked back, saw what I was doing, and turned to join 79 The War of the Worlds me. The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sun- bury, the remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away towards Staines. The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up their positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute silence. It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns. Never since the devising of gun- powder was the beginning of a battle so still. To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had precisely the same effect--the Martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the stars, the afterglow of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St. George's Hill and the woods of Painshill. But facing that crescent everywhere--at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton, Esher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across the flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees or village houses gave sufficient cover--the guns were waiting. The signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and vanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a tense expecta- tion. The Martians had but to advance into the line of fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a thunderous fury of battle. No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle--how much they understood of us. Did they grasp that we in our millions were organized, disciplined, working together? Or did they interpret our spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees? Did they dream they might exterminate us? (At that time no one knew what food they needed.) A hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that vast sentinel shape. And in the back of my mind was the sense of all the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward. Had they prepared pitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare? Would the Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of their mighty province of houses? 80 The War of the Worlds Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and peering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of a gun. Another nearer, and then another. And then the Martian beside us raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report that made the ground heave. The one towards Staines answered him. There was no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation. I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury. As I did so a second report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards Hounslow. I",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",35,"ex- pected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such evidence of its work. But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath. And there had been no crash, no answering ex- plosion. The silence was restored; the minute lengthened to three. ""What has happened?"" said the curate, standing up beside me. ""Heaven knows!"" said I. A bat flickered by and vanished. A distant tumult of shouting began and ceased. I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now moving eastward along the riverbank, with a swift, rolling motion, Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon him; but the evening calm was unbroken. The figure of the Martian grew smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the gathering night had swallowed him up. By a common impulse we clambered higher. Towards Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill had suddenly come into being there, hiding our view of the farther country; and then, remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw another such summit. These hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared. Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen. Everything had suddenly become very still. Far away to the southeast, marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one another, and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns. But the earthly artillery made no reply. 81 The War of the Worlds Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later I was to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the twilight. Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have described, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other possible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him. Some fired only one of these, some two--as in the case of the one we had seen; the one at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time. These canisters smashed on striking the ground--they did not explode--and incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour, coiling and pour- ing upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country. And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was death to all that breathes. It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that, after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather liquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do. And where it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the surface would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and made way for more. The scum was absolutely insoluble, and it is a strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained. The vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do. It hung together in banks, flowing slug- gishly down the slope of the land and driving reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist and moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust. Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the nature of this substance. Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black smoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation, that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison altogether, as was 82 The War of the Worlds proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton. The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the church spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its inky nothingness. For a day and a half he remained there, weary, starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs, green trees,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",36,"and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns, out- houses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight. But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground. As a rule the Martians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it again by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it. This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the starlight from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had returned. From there we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the windows rattled, and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in position there. These continued intermittently for the space of a quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the invisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of the electric light vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow. Then the fourth cylinder fell--a brilliant green meteor--as I learned afterwards, in Bushey Park. Before the guns on the Richmond and Kingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far away in the southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard before the black vapour could over- whelm the gunners. So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps' nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the Londonward country. The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart, until at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden. All night through their destructive tubes advanced. Never once, after the Martian at St. George's Hill was brought down, did they give the artillery the ghost of a chance against them. Wherever there was a possibility of guns being laid 83 The War of the Worlds for them unseen, a fresh canister of the black vapour was discharged, and where the guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray was brought to bear. By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Rich- mond Park and the glare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke, blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as far as the eye could reach. And through this two Martians slowly waded, and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that. They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either be- cause they had but a limited supply of material for its production or because they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the opposition they had aroused. In the latter aim they certainly succeeded. Sun- day night was the end of the organised opposition to their movements. After that no body of men would stand against them, so hopeless was the enterprise. Even the crews of the torpedo-boats and destroyers that had brought their quick- firers up the Thames refused to stop, mutinied, and went down again. The only offensive operation men ventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines and pitfalls, and even in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic. One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteries towards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight. Survivors there were none. One may picture the orderly expectation, the officers alert and watchful, the gunners ready, the ammunition piled to hand, the limber gunners with their horses and waggons, the groups of civilian spectators standing as near as they were permitted, the evening stillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned and wounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the Martians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields. One may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention, the swiftly spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong, towering heavenward, turning the twi- light to a palpable darkness, a strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims, men and horses near it seen dimly, running, shrieking, falling headlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned, men choking and writhing on the 84 The War of the Worlds ground, and the swift broadening-out of the opaque cone of smoke. And then night and extinction-- nothing but a silent mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead. Before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of Richmond, and the disintegrating organism of government was, with a last expiring effort, rousing the population of London to the necessity of flight. 85 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE EXODUS FROM LONDON So you understand the roaring wave of",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",37,"fear that swept through the greatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning--the stream of flight rising swiftly to a torrent, lash- ing in a foaming tumult round the railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle about the shipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channel northward and east- ward. By ten o'clock the police organisation, and by midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency, losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that swift liquefaction of the social body. All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South- Eastern people at Cannon Street had been warned by mid- night on Sunday, and trains were being filled. People were fighting savagely for standing-room in the carriages even at two o'clock. By three, people were being trampled and crushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple of hundred yards or more from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were fired, people stabbed, and the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic, exhausted and infuriated, were breaking the heads of the people they were called out to protect. And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to return to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an ever- thickening multitude away from the stations and along the northward- running roads. By mid- day a Martian had been seen at Barnes, and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in its sluggish advance. Another bank drove over Ealing, and sur- rounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but unable to escape. After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train at Chalk Farm--the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there PLOUGHED through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart men fought 86 The War of the Worlds to keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his furnace--my brother emerged upon the Chalk Farm road, dodged across through a hurrying swarm of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a cycle shop. The front tire of the machine he got was punctured in dragging it through the window, but he got up and off, notwithstanding, with no further injury than a cut wrist. The steep foot of Haverstock Hill was impassable owing to several overturned horses, and my brother struck into Belsize Road. So he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the Edgware Road, reached Edgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well ahead of the crowd. Along the road people were standing in the roadway, curious, wondering. He was passed by a number of cyclists, some horsemen, and two motor cars. A mile from Edgware the rim of the wheel broke, and the machine became unridable. He left it by the roadside and trudged through the village. There were shops half opened in the main street of the place, and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and windows, staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning. He succeeded in getting some food at an inn. For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do. The flying people increased in number. Many of them, like my brother, seemed inclined to loiter in the place. There was no fresh news of the invaders from Mars. At that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from congested. Most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles, but there were soon motor cars, hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, and the dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St. Albans. It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelms- ford, where some friends of his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike into a quiet lane running eastward. Presently he came upon a stile, and, crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward. He passed near several farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn. He saw few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High Barnet, he hap- pened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers. He came upon them just in time to save them. 87 The War of the Worlds He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which they had been driving, while a third with difficulty held the frightened pony's head. One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in white, was simply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure, slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",38,"held in her disengaged hand. My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried towards the struggle. One of the men desisted and turned towards him, and my brother, realising from his an- tagonist's face that a fight was unavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and sent him down against the wheel of the chaise. It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender lady's arm. He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung across his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the direction from which he had come. Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the horse's head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the lane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking back. The man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he stopped him with a blow in the face. Then, realising that he was deserted, he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise, with the sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned now, following remotely. Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong, and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again. He would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help. It seems she had had a revolver all this time, but it had been under the seat when she and her companion were attacked. She fired at six yards' distance, narrowly missing my brother. The less courageous of the robbers made off, and his companion followed him, cursing his cowardice. They both stopped in sight down the lane, where the third man lay insensible. 88 The War of the Worlds ""Take this!"" said the slender lady, and she gave my brother her revolver. ""Go back to the chaise,"" said my brother, wiping the blood from his split lip. She turned without a word--they were both panting--and they went back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony. The robbers had evidently had enough of it. When my brother looked again they were retreating. ""I'll sit here,"" said my brother, ""if I may""; and he got upon the empty front seat. The lady looked over her shoulder. ""Give me the reins,"" she said, and laid the whip along the pony's side. In another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my brother's eyes. So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with a cut mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an unknown lane with these two women. He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon living at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous case at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the Martian advance. He had hurried home, roused the women--their servant had left them two days before--packed some provisions, put his revolver under the seat--luckily for my brother--and told them to drive on to Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there. He stopped behind to tell the neighbours. He would overtake them, he said, at about half past four in the morning, and now it was nearly nine and they had seen nothing of him. They could not stop in Edgware because of the growing traffic through the place, and so they had come into this side lane. That was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently they stopped again, nearer to New Barnet. He promised to stay with them, at least until they could deter- mine what to do, or until the missing man arrived, and pro- fessed to be an expert shot with the revolver--a weapon strange to him--in order to give them confidence. They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became happy in the hedge. He told them of his own escape out of London, 89 The War of the Worlds and all that he knew of these Martians and their ways. The sun crept higher in the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an uneasy state of anticipation. Several wayfarers came along the lane, and of these my brother gathered such news as he could. Every broken answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster that had come on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity for prosecuting",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",39,"this flight. He urged the matter upon them. ""We have money,"" said the slender woman, and hesitated. Her eyes met my brother's, and her hesitation ended. ""So have I,"" said my brother. She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold, besides a five-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get upon a train at St. Albans or New Barnet. My brother thought that was hopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains, and broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and thence escaping from the country altogether. Mrs. Elphinstone--that was the name of the woman in white--would listen to no reasoning, and kept calling upon ""George""; but her sister-in- law was astonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at last agreed to my brother's suggestion. So, designing to cross the Great North Road, they went on towards Barnet, my brother leading the pony to save it as much as possible. As the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively hot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew burning and blinding, so that they travelled only very slowly. The hedges were grey with dust. And as they advanced towards Barnet a tumultuous murmuring grew stronger. They began to meet more people. For the most part these were staring before them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard, unclean. One man in evening dress passed them on foot, his eyes on the ground. They heard his voice, and, looking back at him, saw one hand clutched in his hair and the other beating invisible things. His paroxysm of rage over, he went on his way without once looking back. As my brother's party went on towards the crossroads to the south of Barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on their left, carrying a child and with two other children; and then passed a man in 90 The War of the Worlds dirty black, with a thick stick in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other. Then round the corner of the lane, from between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high road, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a sallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust. There were three girls, East End factory girls, and a couple of little chil- dren crowded in the cart. ""This'll tike us rahnd Edgware?"" asked the driver, wild- eyed, white- faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the left, he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks. My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the houses in front of them, and veiling the white facade of a terrace beyond the road that appeared between the backs of the villas. Mrs. Elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot, blue sky. The tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of many voices, the gride of many wheels, the creaking of waggons, and the staccato of hoofs. The lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the crossroads. ""Good heavens!"" cried Mrs. Elphinstone. ""What is this you are driving us into?"" My brother stopped. For the main road was a boiling stream of people, a tor- rent of human beings rushing northward, one pressing on another. A great bank of dust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and of men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every de- scription. ""Way!"" my brother heard voices crying. ""Make way!"" It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust was hot and pungent. And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa was burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to add to the con- fusion. Two men came past them. Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy 91 The War of the Worlds bundle and weeping. A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue, circled dubiously round them, scared and wretched, and fled at my brother's threat. So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses to the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent in between the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded forms, grew into distinct- ness as they rushed towards the corner, hurried past, and merged their",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",40,"individuality again in a receding multitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust. ""Go on! Go on!"" cried the voices. ""Way! Way!"" One man's hands pressed on the back of another. My brother stood at the pony's head. Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace by pace, down the lane. Edgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult, but this was a whole population in movement. It is hard to imagine that host. It had no character of its own. The figures poured out past the corner, and receded with their backs to the group in the lane. Along the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the wheels, stumbling in the ditches, blundering into one another. The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making little way for those swifter and more impatient vehi- cles that darted forward every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing so, sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the villas. ""Push on!"" was the cry. ""Push on! They are coming!"" In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salva- tion Army, gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, ""Eternity! Eternity!"" His voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother could hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust. Some of the people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses and quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring at nothing with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or lay prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances. The horses"" bits were covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot. There were cabs, carriages, shop cars, waggons, beyond counting; a 92 The War of the Worlds mail cart, a road-cleaner's cart marked ""Vestry of St. Pancras,"" a huge timber waggon crowded with roughs. A brewer's dray rumbled by with its two near wheels splashed with fresh blood. ""Clear the way!"" cried the voices. ""Clear the way!"" ""Eter-nity! Eter-nity!"" came echoing down the road. There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with children that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in dust, their weary faces smeared with tears. With many of these came men, sometimes helpful, sometimes low- ering and savage. Fighting side by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed, loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed. There were sturdy workmen thrusting their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like clerks or shopmen, struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brother noticed, men dressed in the clothes of railway porters, one wretched creature in a nightshirt with a coat thrown over it. But varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had in common. There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind them. A tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent the whole host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and broken that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed activity. The heat and dust had already been at work upon this multitude. Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked. They were all thirsty, weary, and footsore. And amid the various cries one heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue; the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak. Through it all ran a refrain: ""Way! Way! The Martians are coming!"" Few stopped and came aside from that flood. The lane opened slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening, and had a delusive appearance of coming from the direction of London. Yet a kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream, who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again. A little way down the lane, with two friends bending over him, lay a man with a bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags. He was a lucky man to have friends. 93 The War of the Worlds A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black frock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his boot--his sock was blood-stained--shook out a pebble, and hobbled on again; and then a little girl of eight or nine, all alone, threw herself under the hedge close by my brother, weeping. ""I can't go on! I can't go on!"" My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up, speaking gently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphin- stone. So soon as my brother touched her she became quite still, as if frightened. ""Ellen!"" shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in her voice-- ""Ellen!"" And",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",41,"the child suddenly darted away from my brother, crying ""Mother!"" ""They are coming,"" said a man on horseback, riding past along the lane. ""Out of the way, there!"" bawled a coachman, towering high; and my brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane. The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse. My brother pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge, and the man drove by and stopped at the turn of the way. It was a carriage, with a pole for a pair of horses, but only one was in the traces. My brother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge. One of the men came running to my brother. ""Where is there any water?"" he said. ""He is dying fast, and very thirsty. It is Lord Garrick."" ""Lord Garrick!"" said my brother; ""the Chief Justice?"" ""The water?"" he said. ""There may be a tap,"" said my brother, ""in some of the houses. We have no water. I dare not leave my people."" The man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house. ""Go on!"" said the people, thrusting at him. ""They are coming! Go on!"" Then my brother's attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-faced 94 The War of the Worlds man lugging a small handbag, which split even as my brother's eyes rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up into separate coins as it struck the ground. They rolled hither and thither among the struggling feet of men and horses. The man stopped and looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cab struck his shoulder and sent him reeling. He gave a shriek and dodged back, and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly. ""Way!"" cried the men all about him. ""Make way!"" So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands open, upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket. A horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half rising, he had been borne down under the horse's hoofs. ""Stop!"" screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way, tried to clutch the bit of the horse. Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch's back. The driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran round behind the cart. The multi- tudinous shouting confused his ears. The man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable to rise, for the wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp and dead. My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a man on a black horse came to his assistance. ""Get him out of the road,"" said he; and, clutching the man's collar with his free hand, my brother lugged him sideways. But he still clutched after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering at his arm with a handful of gold. ""Go on! Go on!"" shouted angry voices behind. ""Way! Way!"" There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that the man on horseback stopped. My brother looked up, and the man with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar. There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering sideways, and the carthorse pushed beside it. A hoof missed my brother's foot by a hair's breadth. He released his grip on the fallen man and jumped back. He saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on the ground, and in 95 The War of the Worlds a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane, and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it. He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with all a child's want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed under the rolling wheels. ""Let us go back!"" he shouted, and began turning the pony round. ""We cannot cross this--hell,"" he said and they went back a hundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting crowd was hidden. As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white and drawn, and shining with perspi- ration. The two women sat silent, crouching in their seat and shivering. Then beyond the bend my brother stopped",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",42,"again. Miss Elphinstone was white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched even to call upon ""George."" My brother was horrified and perplexed. So soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to attempt this crossing. He turned to Miss Elphinstone, sud- denly resolute. ""We must go that way,"" he said, and led the pony round again. For the second time that day this girl proved her quality. To force their way into the torrent of people, my brother plunged into the traffic and held back a cab horse, while she drove the pony across its head. A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter from the chaise. In another moment they were caught and swept forward by the stream. My brother, with the cabman's whip marks red across his face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her. ""Point the revolver at the man behind,"" he said, giving it to her, ""if he presses us too hard. No!--point it at his horse."" Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across the road. But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition, to become a part of that dusty rout. They swept through Chipping Barnet with the torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before they had fought across to the opposite side of the way. It was din and con- fusion indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road forks repeatedly, 96 The War of the Worlds and this to some extent relieved the stress. They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of the road, and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude of people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come at the water. And farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they saw two trains running slowly one after the other without signal or order--trains swarming with people, with men even among the coals behind the engines--going northward along the Great Northern Railway. My brother supposes they must have filled outside London, for at that time the furious terror of the people had rendered the central termini impossible. Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them. They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and none of them dared to sleep. And in the evening many people came hurrying along the road near- by their stopping place, fleeing from unknown dangers before them, and going in the direction from which my brother had come. 97 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ""THUNDER CHILD"" Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Monday have annihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself slowly through the home counties. Not only along the road through Barnet, but also through Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the roads eastward to South- end and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thames to Deal and Broadstairs, poured the same frantic rout. If one could have hung that June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above London every northward and eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives, each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress. I have set forth at length in the last chapter my brother's account of the road through Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise how that swarming of black dots appeared to one of those con- cerned. Never before in the history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. The legendary hosts of Goths and Huns, the hugest armies Asia has ever seen, would have been but a drop in that current. And this was no disciplined march; it was a stampede--a stampede gigantic and terrible--without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout of civilisation, of the massacre of mankind. Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of streets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents, gardens--already derelict--spread out like a huge map, and in the southward BLOTTED. Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would have seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart. Steadily, incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting out ramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising ground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley, exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper. And beyond, over the",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",43,"blue hills that rise southward of the river, the 98 The War of the Worlds glittering Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodically spreading their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that, laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose, and taking possession of the conquered country. They do not seem to have aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoral- isation and the destruction of any opposition. They exploded any stores of powder they came upon, cut every telegraph, and wrecked the railways here and there. They were ham- stringing mankind. They seemed in no hurry to extend the field of their operations, and did not come beyond the central part of London all that day. It is possible that a very con- siderable number of people in London stuck to their houses through Monday morning. Certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the Black Smoke. Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene. Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the enormous sums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that many who swam out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and drowned. About one o'clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge. At that the Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting, and collision, and for some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and lightermen had to fight savagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront. People were actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from above. When, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower and waded down the river, nothing but wreck- age floated above Limehouse. Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell. The sixth star fell at Wimbledon. My brother, keeping watch beside the women in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond the hills. On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across the sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester. The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of London was confirmed. They had been seen at Highgate, and even, it was said, at Neasden. But they did not come into my brother's view until the morrow. That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need of 99 The War of the Worlds provisions. As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to be regarded. Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds, granaries, and ripening root crops with arms in their hands. A number of people now, like my brother, had their faces eastward, and there were some des- perate souls even going back towards London to get food. These were chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge of the Black Smoke came by hearsay. He heard that about half the members of the government had gathered at Birmingham, and that enormous quantities of high explo- sives were being prepared to be used in automatic mines across the Midland counties. He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the desertions of the first day's panic, had resumed traffic, and was running northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion of the home counties. There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar announcing that large stores of flour were available in the northern towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed among the starving people in the neighbourhood. But this intelli- gence did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and the three pressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distribution than this promise. Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hear more of it. That night fell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose Hill. It fell while Miss Elphinstone was watching, for she took that duty alter- nately with my brother. She saw it. On Wednesday the three fugitives--they had passed the night in a field of unripe wheat--reached Chelmsford, and there a body of the inhabitants, calling itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized the pony as provisions, and would give nothing in exchange for it but the promise of a share in it the next day. Here there were rumours of Martians at Epping, and news of the destruction of Waltham Abbey Powder Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders. People were watching for Martians here from the church towers. My brother, very luckily for him as it chanced,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",44,"pre- ferred to push on at once to the coast rather than wait for food, although all three of them were very hungry. By mid- day they passed through Tillingham, which, strangely enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, save for a few furtive 100 The War of the Worlds plunderers hunting for food. Near Tillingham they suddenly came in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd of shipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine. For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came on to the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and afterwards to Foulness and Shoebury, to bring off the people. They lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the Naze. Close inshore was a multitude of fishing smacks--English, Scotch, French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches from the Thames, yachts, electric boats; and beyond were ships of large burden, a multitude of filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships, passenger boats, petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport even, neat white and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and along the blue coast across the Blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of boats chaffering with the people on the beach, a swarm which also extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon. About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water, almost, to my brother's perception, like a water- logged ship. This was the ram THUNDER CHILD. It was the only warship in sight, but far away to the right over the smooth surface of the sea--for that day there was a dead calm--lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next iron- clads of the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line, steam up and ready for action, across the Thames estuary during the course of the Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it. At the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the assurances of her sister-in-law, gave way to panic. She had never been out of England before, she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a foreign country, and so forth. She seemed, poor woman, to imagine that the French and the Martians might prove very similar. She had been growing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressed during the two days' journeyings. Her great idea was to return to Stanmore. Things had been always well and safe at Stanmore. They would find George at Stanmore. It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the beach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention of 101 The War of the Worlds some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames. They sent a boat and drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three. The steamer was going, these men said, to Ostend. It was about two o'clock when my brother, having paid their fares at the gangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his charges. There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and the three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward. There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some of whom had expended their last money in securing a passage, but the captain lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded. He would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of guns that began about that hour in the south. As if in answer, the ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags. A jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels. Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from Shoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder. At the same time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of black smoke. But my brother's attention speedily reverted to the distant firing in the south. He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising out of the distant grey haze. The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big crescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and hazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance, advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness. At that the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his terror. Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the steamer and stared",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",45,"at that distant shape, higher than the trees or church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human stride. It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more amazed than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately towards the shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell 102 The War of the Worlds away. Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another, striding over some stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther off, wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between sea and sky. They were all stalking seaward, as if to intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between Foulness and the Naze. In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the little paddle- boat, and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind her, she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance. Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of shipping already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship passing behind another, another coming round from broadside to end on, steamships whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let out, launches rushing hither and thither. He was so fascinated by this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for anything seaward. And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from the seat upon which he was standing. There was a shouting all about him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered faintly. The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands. He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of a plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the waterline. A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment. When his eyes were clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward. Big iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure, and from that twin funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire. It was the torpedo ram, THUNDER CHILD, steaming headlong, coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping. Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks, my brother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again, and he saw the three of them now close together, and standing so far out to sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged. Thus sunken, 103 The War of the Worlds and seen in remote perspective, they appeared far less formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was pitching so helplessly. It would seem they were regarding this new antagonist with astonishment. To their intelligence, it may be, the giant was even such another as themselves. The THUNDER CHILD fired no gun, but simply drove full speed towards them. It was probably her not firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did. They did not know what to make of her. One shell, and they would have sent her to the bottom forthwith with the Heat- Ray. She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway between the steamboat and the Martians-- a diminishing black bulk against the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast. Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and dis- charged a canister of the black gas at the ironclad. It hit her larboard side and glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding torrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear. To the watchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in their eyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians. They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like generator of the Heat-Ray. He held it pointing obliquely downward, and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch. It must have driven through the iron of the ship's side like a white-hot iron rod through paper. A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the Martian reeled and staggered. In another moment he was cut down, and a great body of water and steam shot high in the air. The guns of the THUNDER CHILD sounded through the reek, going off one after the other, and",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",46,"one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer, ricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a smack to matchwood. But no one heeded that very much. At the sight of the Martian's collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticu- lately, and all the crowding passengers on the steamer's stern shouted together. And then they yelled again. For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove 104 The War of the Worlds something long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts, its ventila- tors and funnels spouting fire. She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and her engines working. She headed straight for a second Martian, and was within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear. Then with a violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped upward. The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and in another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the impetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of cardboard. My brother shouted involuntarily. A boiling tumult of steam hid everything again. ""Two!,"" yelled the captain. Everyone was shouting. The whole steamer from end to end rang with frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea. The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third Martian and the coast altogether. And all this time the boat was paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last the confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened, and nothing of the THUNDER CHILD could be made out, nor could the third Martian be seen. But the ironclads to seaward were now quite close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat. The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the ironclads receded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by a marbled bank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and combining in the strangest way. The fleet of refugees was scattering to the northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the steamboat. After a time, and before they reached the sinking cloud bank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went about and passed into the thickening haze of evening south- ward. The coast grew faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that were gathering about the sinking sun. Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving. Everyone 105 The War of the Worlds struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west, but nothing was to be dis- tinguished clearly. A mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun. The steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense. The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and dark- ened, the evening star trembled into sight. It was deep twilight when the captain cried out and pointed. My brother strained his eyes. Something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness--rushed slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, and very large, that swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and van- ished again into the grey mystery of the night. And as it flew it rained down darkness upon the land. 106 The War of the Worlds BOOK TWO THE EARTH UNDER THE MARTIANS 107 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER ONE UNDER FOOT In the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two chapters I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at Halliford whither we fled to escape the Black Smoke. There I will resume. We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day--the day of the panic-- in a little island of daylight, cut off by the Black Smoke from the rest of the world. We could do nothing but wait in aching inactivity during those two weary days. My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife. I figured her at Leatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man. I paced the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off from her, of all that might hap- pen to her in my absence. My cousin I knew was brave enough for any emergency, but he was not the sort of man to realise",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",47,"danger quickly, to rise promptly. What was needed now was not bravery, but circumspection. My only consola- tion was to believe that the Martians were moving London- ward and away from her. Such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful. I grew very weary and irritable with the curate's perpetual ejaculations; I tired of the sight of his selfish despair. After some ineffectual remonstrance I kept away from him, staying in a room--evidently a children's schoolroom--containing globes, forms, and copybooks. When he followed me thither, I went to a box room at the top of the house and, in order to be alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in. We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and the morning of the next. There were signs of people in the next house on Sunday evening--a face at a window and moving lights, and later the slamming of a door. But I do not know who these people were, nor what became of them. We saw nothing of them next day. The Black Smoke drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creep- ing nearer and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house that 108 The War of the Worlds hid us. A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the windows it touched, and scalded the curate's hand as he fled out of the front room. When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had passed over it. Looking towards the river, we were astonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows. For a time we did not see how this change affected our position, save that we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke. But later I perceived that we were no longer hemmed in, that now we might get away. So soon as I realised that the way of escape was open, my dream of action returned. But the curate was lethargic, unreasonable. ""We are safe here,"" he repeated; ""safe here."" I resolved to leave him--would that I had! Wiser now for the artilleryman's teaching, I sought out food and drink. I had found oil and rags for my burns, and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that I found in one of the bedrooms. When it was clear to him that I meant to go alone-- had reconciled myself to going alone--he suddenly roused himself to come. And all being quiet throughout the afternoon, we started about five o'clock, as I should judge, along the blackened road to Sunbury. In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and luggage, all covered thickly with black dust. That pall of cindery powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii. We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of strange and unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were relieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suf- focating drift. We went through Bushey Park, with its deer going to and fro under the chestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards Hampton, and so we came to Twickenham. These were the first people we saw. Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Peter- sham were still afire. Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke, and there were more people about here, though none could give us news. 109 The War of the Worlds For the most part they were like ourselves, taking advantage of a lull to shift their quarters. I have an impression that many of the houses here were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even for flight. Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the road. I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap, pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts. We crossed Richmond Bridge about half past eight. We hurried across the exposed bridge, of course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses, some many feet across. I did not know what these were--there was no time for scrutiny--and I put a more horrible interpretation on them than they deserved. Here again on the Surrey side were black dust that had once been smoke, and dead bodies--a heap near the approach to the station; but we had no glimpse of the Martians until we were some way towards Barnes. We saw in the blackened distance a",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

Up the hill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside the town of Richmond there was no trace of the Black Smoke. Then suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of people running, and the upperworks of a Martian fighting- machine loomed in sight over the housetops, not a hundred yards away from us. We stood aghast at our danger, and had the Martian looked down we must immediately have perished. We were so terrified that we dared not go on, but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden. There the curate crouched, weeping silently, and refusing to stir again. But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest, and in the twilight I ventured out again. I went through a shrubbery, and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds, and so emerged upon the road towards Kew. The curate I left in the shed, but he came hurrying after me. That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did. For it was manifest the Martians were about us. No sooner had the curate overtaken me than we saw either the fighting- machine we had seen before or another, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew Lodge. Four 110 The War of the Worlds or five little black figures hurried before it across the green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian pursued them. In three strides he was among them, and they ran radiating from his feet in all directions. He used no Heat-Ray to destroy them, but picked them up one by one. Apparently he tossed them into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much as a workman's basket hangs over his shoulder. It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any other purpose than destruction with defeated humanity. We stood for a moment petrified, then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled garden, fell into, rather than found, a fortunate ditch, and lay there, scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were out. I suppose it was nearly eleven o'clock before we gathered courage to start again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along hedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the darkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who seemed to be all about us. In one place we blundered upon a scorched and blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered dead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty feet, perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages. Sheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent and deserted. Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too dark for us to see into the side roads of the place. In Sheen my companion suddenly com- plained of faintness and thirst, and we decided to try one of the houses. The first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the window, was a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable left in the place but some mouldy cheese. There was, however, water to drink; and I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in our next house- breaking. We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake. Here there stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the pantry of this domicile we found a store of food--two loaves of bread in a pan, an uncooked steak, and the half of a ham. I give this catalogue so precisely 111 The War of the Worlds because, as it happened, we were destined to subsist upon this store for the next fortnight. Bottled beer stood under a shelf, and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces. This pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in this was firewood; there was also a cupboard, in which we found nearly a dozen of burgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of biscuits. We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark--for we dared not strike a light--and ate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle. The curate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly enough, for pushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us. ""It can't be midnight yet,"" I said, and then came a",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",49,"blinding glare of vivid green light. Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly visible in green and black, and vanished again. And then followed such a concussion as I have never heard before or since. So close on the heels of this as to seem in- stantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash of glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the plaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of fragments upon our heads. I was knocked headlong across the floor against the oven handle and stunned. I was insensible for a long time, the curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness again, and he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from a cut forehead, was dabbing water over me. For some time I could not recollect what had happened. Then things came to me slowly. A bruise on my temple as- serted itself. ""Are you better?"" asked the curate in a whisper. At last I answered him. I sat up. ""Don't move,"" he said. ""The floor is covered with smashed crockery from the dresser. You can't possibly move without making a noise, and I fancy THEY are outside."" We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other breathing. Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near us, some plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound. Outside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle. ""That!"" said the curate, when presently it happened again. 112 The War of the Worlds ""Yes,"" I said. ""But what is it?"" ""A Martian!"" said the curate. I listened again. ""It was not like the Heat-Ray,"" I said, and for a time I was inclined to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled against the house, as I had seen one stumble against the tower of Shepperton Church. Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or four hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved. And then the light filtered in, not through the window, which remained black, but through a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the wall behind us. The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the first time. The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet. Outside, the soil was banked high against the house. At the top of the window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe. The floor was littered with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house was broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was evident the greater part of the house had collapsed. Con- trasting vividly with this ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale green, and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitating blue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range. As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the body of a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still glowing cylinder. At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery. Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind. ""The fifth cylinder,"" I whispered, ""the fifth shot from Mars, has struck this house and buried us under the ruins!"" For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered: ""God have mercy upon us!"" I heard him presently whimpering to himself. Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my part scarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of the 113 The War of the Worlds kitchen door. I could just see the curate's face, a dim, oval shape, and his collar and cuffs. Outside there began a metallic hammering, then a violent hooting, and then again, after a quiet interval, a hissing like the hissing of an engine. These noises, for the most part problematical, continued intermittently, and seemed if any- thing to increase in number as time wore on. Presently a measured thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the vessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued. Once the light was eclipsed, and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely dark. For many hours we must have crouched there, silent and shivering, until our tired attention failed. . . . At last I found myself awake and very hungry. I am in- clined to believe we must have spent the",no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",50,"greater portion of a day before that awakening. My hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to action. I told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way towards the pantry. He made me no answer, but so soon as I began eating the faint noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling after me. 114 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER TWO WHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSE After eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have dozed again, for when presently I looked round I was alone. The thudding vibration continued with wearisome persistence. I whispered for the curate several times, and at last felt my way to the door of the kitchen. It was still day- light, and I perceived him across the room, lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the Martians. His shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden from me. I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed; and the place rocked with that beating thud. Through the aperture in the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky. For a minute or so I remained watching the curate, and then I advanced, crouching and stepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor. I touched the curate's leg, and he started so violently that a mass of plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact. I gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we crouched motionless. Then I turned to see how much of our rampart remained. The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open in the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet suburban roadway. Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld. The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house we had first visited. The building had vanished, completely smashed, pulverised, and dispersed by the blow. The cylinder lay now far beneath the original foundations-- deep in a hole, already vastly larger than the pit I had looked into at Woking. The earth all round it had splashed under that tremendous impact--""splashed"" is the only word --and lay in heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent houses. It had behaved exactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer. Our house had collapsed backward; 115 The War of the Worlds the front portion, even on the ground floor, had been destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen and scullery had escaped, and stood buried now under soil and ruins, closed in by tons of earth on every side save towards the cylinder. Over that aspect we hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the Martians were engaged in making. The heavy beating sound was evidently just behind us, and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole. The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on the farther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery, one of the great fighting-machines, deserted by its occupant, stood stiff and tall against the evening sky. At first I scarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder, although it has been convenient to describe them first, on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism I saw busy in the excavation, and on account of the strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it. The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first. It was one of those complicated fabrics that have since been called handling- machines, and the study of which has already given such an enormous impetus to terrestrial invention. As it dawned upon me first, it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed, agile legs, and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars, and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body. Most of its arms were retracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of rods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and apparently strengthened the walls of the cylinder. These, as it ex- tracted them, were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it. Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did not see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter. The fighting-machines were co-ordinated and animated to an extraordinary pitch, but nothing to compare with this. People who",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",51,"have never seen these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon, scarcely realise that living quality. I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war. The artist had evidently made a 116 The War of the Worlds hasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and there his knowledge ended. He pre- sented them as tilted, stiff tripods, without either flexibility or subtlety, and with an altogether misleading monotony of effect. The pamphlet containing these renderings had a con- siderable vogue, and I mention them here simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have created. They were no more like the Martians I saw in action than a Dutch doll is like a human being. To my mind, the pamphlet would have been much better without them. At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine, but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the controlling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab's cerebral portion. But then I perceived the re- semblance of its grey-brown, shiny, leathery integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and the true nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me. With that realisation my interest shifted to those other creatures, the real Martians. Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the first nausea no longer obscured my observa- tion. Moreover, I was concealed and motionless, and under no urgency of action. They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible to conceive. They were huge round bodies--or, rather, heads--about four feet in diameter, each body having in front of it a face. This face had no nostrils--indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any sense of smell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and just beneath this a kind of fleshy beak. In the back of this head or body--I scarcely know how to speak of it--was the single tight tympanic surface, since known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almost useless in our dense air. In a group round the mouth were sixteen slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eight each. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by that distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the HANDS. Even as I saw these Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to raise themselves on these hands, but of course, with the increased weight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible. There is reason to suppose that on Mars they may have 117 The War of the Worlds progressed upon them with some facility. The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since shown, was almost equally simple. The greater part of the structure was the brain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles. Besides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouth opened, and the heart and its vessels. The pulmonary distress caused by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin. And this was the sum of the Martian organs. Strange as it may seem to a human being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes up the bulk of our bodies, did not exist in the Martians. They were heads-- merely heads. Entrails they had none. They did not eat, much less digest. Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of other creatures, and INJECTED it into their own veins. I have myself seen this being done, as I shall mention in its place. But, squeamish as I may seem, I cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure even to continue watching. Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from a still living animal, in most cases from a human being, was run directly by means of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . . The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at the same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit. The physiological advantages of the practice of injection are undeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process. Our bodies are half turning made up of glands and heterogeneous food into blood. The digestive processes and their reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds. Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers, or sound gastric glands. But the",yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no

These creatures, to judge 118 The War of the Worlds from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands, were bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of the silicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feet high and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets. Two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, and all were killed before earth was reached. It was just as well for them, for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every bone in their bodies. And while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place certain further details which, although they were not all evident to us at the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures. In three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours. Their organisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of man sleeps. Since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate, that periodical extinction was unknown to them. They had little or no sense of fatigue, it would seem. On earth they could never have moved without effort, yet even to the last they kept in action. In twenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earth is perhaps the case with the ants. In the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world, the Martians were absolutely without sex, and therefore without any of the tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men. A young Martian, there can now be no dispute, was really born upon earth during the war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially BUDDED off, just as young lilybulbs bud off, or like the young animals in the fresh- water polyp. In man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method of increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the primitive method. Among the lower animals, up even to those first cousins of the vertebrated animals, the Tunicates, the two processes occur side by side, but finally the sexual method superseded its competitor altogether. On Mars, however, just the reverse has apparently been the case. It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of quasi- 119 The War of the Worlds scientific repute, writing long before the Martian inva- sion, did forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martian condition. His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November or December, 1893, in a long-defunct publica- tion, the PALL MALL BUDGET, and I recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called PUNCH. He pointed out- - writing in a foolish, facetious tone--that the perfection of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; the perfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as hair, external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential parts of the human being, and that the tendency of natural selection would lie in the direction of their steady diminution through the coming ages. The brain alone re- mained a cardinal necessity. Only one other part of the body had a strong case for survival, and that was the hand, ""teacher and agent of the brain."" While the rest of the body dwindled, the hands would grow larger. There is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians we have beyond dispute the actual accomplish- ment of such a suppression of the animal side of the organism by the intelligence. To me it is quite credible that the Martians may be descended from beings not unlike ourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (the latter giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last) at the expense of the rest of the body. Without the body the brain would, of course, become a mere selfish intelligence, without any of the emotional substratum of the human being. The last salient point in which the systems of these creatures differed from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial particular. Micro-organisms, which cause so much disease and pain on earth, have either never appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary science eliminated them ages ago. A hundred diseases, all the fevers and con- tagions of human life, consumption, cancers, tumours and such morbidities, never enter the scheme of their life. And speaking of the differences between the life on Mars and terrestrial",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",53,"life, I may allude here to the curious suggestions of the red weed. Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green for a dominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint. At any rate, the seeds 120 The War of the Worlds which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths. Only that known popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition with terrestrial forms. The red creeper was quite a transitory growth, and few people have seen it growing. For a time, however, the red weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance. It spread up the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment, and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our triangular window. And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the country, and especially wherever there was a stream of water. The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a single round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual range not very different from ours except that, according to Philips, blue and violet were as black to them. It is commonly supposed that they com- municated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted, for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet (written evidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions) to which I have already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief source of information con- cerning them. Now no surviving human being saw so much of the Martians in action as I did. I take no credit to myself for an accident, but the fact is so. And I assert that I watched them closely time after time, and that I have seen four, five, and (once) six of them sluggishly performing the most elabo- rately complicated operations together without either sound or gesture. Their peculiar hooting invariably preceded feed- ing; it had no modulation, and was, I believe, in no sense a signal, but merely the expiration of air preparatory to the suctional operation. I have a certain claim to at least an elementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I am convinced--as firmly as I am convinced of anything--that the Martians interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation. And I have been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions. Before the Martian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may remember, I had written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory. The Martians wore no clothing. Their conceptions of orna- ment and decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they 121 The War of the Worlds evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are, but changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all seriously. Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the other artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great superiority over man lay. We men, with our bicycles and road-skates, our Lilienthal soaring- machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, are just in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked out. They have become practically mere brains, wearing different bodies according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet. And of their appliances, perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism is absent--the WHEEL is absent; among all the things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels. One would have at least expected it in locomotion. And in this connection it is curious to remark that even on this earth Nature has never hit upon the wheel, or has preferred other expedients to its development. And not only did the Martians either not know of (which is incredible), or abstain from, the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly little use is made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot, with circular motions thereabout confined to one plane. Almost all the joints of the machinery present a com- plicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beauti- fully curved friction bearings. And while upon this matter of detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of electricity. In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions, which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, was attained. Such",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",54,"quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine which, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched un- packing the cylinder. It seemed infinitely more alive than the actual Martians lying beyond it in the sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual tentacles, and moving feebly after their vast journey across space. While I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight, and 122 The War of the Worlds noting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded me of his presence by pulling violently at my arm. I turned to a scowling face, and silent, eloquent lips. He wanted the slit, which permitted only one of us to peep through; and so I had to forego watching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege. When I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already put together several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder into a shape having an un- mistakable likeness to its own; and down on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view, emitting jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit, excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner. This it was which had caused the regular beating noise, and the rhythmic shocks that had kept our ruinous refuge quiver- ing. It piped and whistled as it worked. So far as I could see, the thing was without a directing Martian at all. 123 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER THREE THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT The arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole into the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martian might see down upon us behind our barrier. At a later date we began to feel less in danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of the sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness, but at first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery in heart-throbbing retreat. Yet terrible as was the danger we incurred, the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresist- ible. And I recall now with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinite danger in which we were between starvation and a still more terrible death, we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight. We would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and the dread of making a noise, and strike each other, and thrust add kick, within a few inches of exposure. The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits of thought and action, and our danger and isolation only accentuated the incompatibility. At Halliford I had al- ready come to hate the curate's trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity of mind. His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made to think out a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and intensified, almost to the verge of craziness. He was as lacking in restraint as a silly woman. He would weep for hours together, and I verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought his weak tears in some way efficacious. And I would sit in the darkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his importunities. He ate more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed out that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until the Martians had done with their pit, that in that long patience a time might presently come when we should need food. He ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long intervals. He slept little. As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any considera- tion so 124 The War of the Worlds intensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed doing it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows. That brought him to reason for a time. But he was one of those weak creatures, void of pride, timorous, anaemic, hateful souls, full of shifty cunning, who face neither God nor man, who face not even themselves. It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but I set them down that my story may lack nothing. Those who have escaped the dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flash of rage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame; for they know what is wrong as well as any, but not what is possible to tortured men. But those who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to elemental things, will have a wider charity. And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",55,"snatched food and drink, and gripping hands and blows, without, in the pitiless sunlight of that terrible June, was the strange wonder, the unfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit. Let me return to those first new experi- ences of mine. After a long time I ventured back to the peephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting- machines. These last had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an orderly manner about the cylinder. The second handling-machine was now completed, and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the big machine had brought. This was a body resembling a milk can in its general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and from which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below. The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the handling-machine. With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle above, while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed rusty and black- ened clinkers from the middle part of the machine. Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the mound of bluish dust. From this unseen receiver a little thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air. As I looked, the handling-machine, with a faint 125 The War of the Worlds and musical clinking, extended, telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere blunt projection, until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay. In another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight, untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit. Between sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a hundred such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound of bluish dust rose steadily until it topped the side of the pit. The contrast between the swift and complex movements of these contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was acute, and for days I had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter were indeed the living of the two things. The curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought to the pit. I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with all my ears. He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that we were observed, crouched in a spasm of terror. He came sliding down the rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate, gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic. His gesture suggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while my curiosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and clambered up to it. At first I could see no reason for his frantic behaviour. The twilight had now come, the stars were little and faint, but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from the aluminium-making. The whole picture was a flickering scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangely trying to the eyes. Over and through it all went the bats, heeding it not at all. The sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the mound of blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a fighting-machine, with its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated, stood across the corner of the pit. And then, amid the clangour of the machinery, came a drifting suspicion of human voices, that I entertained at first only to dismiss. I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfy- ing myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a Martian. As the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of his integument and the brightness of his eyes. And suddenly I heard a yell, and saw a long 126 The War of the Worlds tentacle reach- ing over the shoulder of the machine to the little cage that hunched upon its back. Then something--something strug- gling violently- -was lifted high against the sky, a black, vague enigma against the starlight; and as this black object came down again, I saw by the green brightness that it was a man. For an instant he was clearly visible. He was a stout, ruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed; three days before, he must have been walking the world, a man of considerable consequence. I could see his staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain. He vanished behind the mound, and for a moment there was silence. And",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",56,"then began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from the Martians. I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands over my ears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching silently with his arms over his head, looked up as I passed, cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me. That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had, al- though I felt an urgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape; but afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider our position with great clearness. The curate, I found, was quite incapable of dis- cussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him of all vestiges of reason or forethought. Practically he had already sunk to the level of an animal. But as the saying goes, I gripped myself with both hands. It grew upon my mind, once I could face the facts, that terrible as our posi- tion was, there was as yet no justification for absolute despair. Our chief chance lay in the possibility of the Martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment. Or even if they kept it permanently, they might not consider it necessary to guard it, and a chance of escape might be afforded us. I also weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a direction away from the pit, but the chances of our emerging within sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great. And I should have had to do all the digging myself. The curate would certainly have failed me. It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw the lad killed. It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the Martians 127 The War of the Worlds feed. After that experience I avoided the hole in the wall for the better part of a day. I went into the scullery, removed the door, and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible; but when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the loose earth collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue. I lost heart, and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time, having no spirit even to move. And after that I abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by excavation. It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that at first I entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about by their overthrow through any human effort. But on the fourth or fifth night I heard a sound like heavy guns. It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining brightly. The Martians had taken away the excavating- machine, and, save for a fighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a handling- machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit immedi- ately beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them. Except for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and patches of white moonlight the pit was in dark- ness, and, except for the clinking of the handling-machine, quite still. That night was a beautiful serenity; save for one planet, the moon seemed to have the sky to herself. I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was that made me listen. Then I heard quite distinctly a booming ex- actly like the sound of great guns. Six distinct reports I counted, and after a long interval six again. And that was all. 128 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER FOUR THE DEATH OF THE CURATE It was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for the last time, and presently found myself alone. Instead of keeping close to me and trying to oust me from the slit, the curate had gone back into the scullery. I was struck by a sudden thought. I went back quickly and quietly into the scullery. In the darkness I heard the curate drink- ing. I snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught a bottle of burgundy. For a few minutes there was a tussle. The bottle struck the floor and broke, and I desisted and rose. We stood panting and threatening each other. In the end I planted myself between him and the food, and told him of my determination to begin a discipline. I divided the food in the pantry, into rations to last us ten days. I would not let him eat any more that day. In the afternoon he",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",57,"made a feeble effort to get at the food. I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake. All day and all night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, and he weeping and com- plaining of his immediate hunger. It was, I know, a night and a day, but to me it seemed-- it seems now--an inter- minable length of time. And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict. For two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests. There were times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when I cajoled and persuaded him, and once I tried to bribe him with the last bottle of burgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I could get water. But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed beyond reason. He would neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy babbling to himself. The rudi- mentary precautions to keep our imprisonment endurable he would not observe. Slowly I began to realise the complete overthrow of his intelligence, to perceive that my sole com- panion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane. From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind wandered at times. I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept. It 129 The War of the Worlds sounds paradoxical, but I am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity of the curate warned me, braced me, and kept me a sane man. On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whis- pering, and nothing I could do would moderate his speech. ""It is just, O God!"" he would say, over and over again. ""It is just. On me and mine be the punishment laid. We have sinned, we have fallen short. There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust, and I held my peace. I preached acceptable folly--my God, what folly! --when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and called upon them to repent- repent! . . . Oppressors of the poor and needy . . . ! The wine press of God!"" Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld from him, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening. He began to raise his voice--I prayed him not to. He perceived a hold on me--he threatened he would shout and bring the Martians upon us. For a time that scared me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond estimating. I defied him, although I felt no assurance that he might not do this thing. But that day, at any rate, he did not. He talked with his voice rising slowly, through the greater part of the eighth and ninth days-- threats, entreaties, mingled with a torrent of half-sane and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of God's service, such as made me pity him. Then he slept awhile, and began again with renewed strength, so loudly that I must needs make him desist. ""Be still!"" I implored. He rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the dark- ness near the copper. ""I have been still too long,"" he said, in a tone that must have reached the pit, ""and now I must bear my witness. Woe unto this unfaithful city! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! To the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet----"" ""Shut up!"" I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the Martians should hear us. ""For God's sake----"" ""Nay,"" shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, stand- ing likewise and extending his arms. ""Speak! The word of the Lord is upon me!"" 130 The War of the Worlds In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen. ""I must bear my witness! I go! It has already been too long delayed."" I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall. In a flash I was after him. I was fierce with fear. Before he was halfway across the kitchen I had overtaken him. With one last touch of humanity I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt. He went headlong for- ward and lay stretched on the ground. I stumbled over him and stood panting. He lay still. Suddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of slipping plaster, and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened. I looked up and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine coming slowly across the hole. One of its gripping limbs curled amid the debris; another limb ap- peared, feeling its way over the fallen beams. I",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",58,"stood petrified, staring. Then I saw through a sort of glass plate near the edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large dark eyes of a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came feeling slowly through the hole. I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the scullery door. The tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, in the room, and twisting and turn- ing, with queer sudden movements, this way and that. For a while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful advance. Then, with a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the scullery. I trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright. I opened the door of the coal cellar, and stood there in the darkness staring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listen- ing. Had the Martian seen me? What was it doing now? Something was moving to and fro there, very quietly; every now and then it tapped against the wall, or started on its movements with a faint metallic ringing, like the movements of keys on a split-ring. Then a heavy body--I knew too well what--was dragged across the floor of the kitchen towards the opening. Irresistibly attracted, I crept to the door and peeped into the kitchen. In the triangle of bright outer sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine, scrutinizing the curate's head. I thought at once that it would infer my presence from the mark of the blow I had given him. 131 The War of the Worlds I crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover myself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in the darkness, among the firewood and coal therein. Every now and then I paused, rigid, to hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles through the opening again. Then the faint metallic jingle returned. I traced it slowly feeling over the kitchen. Presently I heard it nearer--in the scullery, as I judged. I thought that its length might be in- sufficient to reach me. I prayed copiously. It passed, scrap- ing faintly across the cellar door. An age of almost intolerable suspense intervened; then I heard it fumbling at the latch! It had found the door! The Martians understood doors! It worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then the door opened. In the darkness I could just see the thing--like an ele- phant's trunk more than anything else--waving towards me and touching and examining the wall, coals, wood and ceil- ing. It was like a black worm swaying its blind head to and fro. Once, even, it touched the heel of my boot. I was on the verge of screaming; I bit my hand. For a time the tentacle was silent. I could have fancied it had been withdrawn. Presently, with an abrupt click, it gripped something--I thought it had me!--and seemed to go out of the cellar again. For a minute I was not sure. Apparently it had taken a lump of coal to examine. I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position, which had become cramped, and then listened. I whispered passionate prayers for safety. Then I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards me again. Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching against the walls and tapping the furniture. While I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the cellar door and closed it. I heard it go into the pantry, and the biscuit-tins rattled and a bottle smashed, and then came a heavy bump against the cellar door. Then silence that passed into an infinity of suspense. Had it gone? 132 The War of the Worlds At last I decided that it had. It came into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth day in the close darkness, buried among coals and firewood, not daring even to crawl out for the drink for which I craved. It was the eleventh day before I ventured so far from my security. 133 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER FIVE THE STILLNESS My first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten the door between the kitchen and the scullery. But the pantry was empty; every scrap of food had gone. Appar- ently, the Martian had taken it all on the previous day. At that discovery I despaired for the first time. I took no food, or no drink either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day. At first my mouth and throat were parched, and my strength ebbed sensibly. I sat about in the darkness of the scullery, in a state of despondent wretchedness. My mind ran on eating. I thought I had become",no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",59,"deaf, for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hear from the pit had ceased absolutely. I did not feel strong enough to crawl noiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there. On the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chance of alarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump that stood by the sink, and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and tainted rain water. I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened by the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping. During these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much of the curate and of the manner of his death. On the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and dozed and thought disjointedly of eating and of vague im- possible plans of escape. Whenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms, of the death of the curate, or of sump- tuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt a keen pain that urged me to drink again and again. The light that came into the scullery was no longer grey, but red. To my disordered imagination it seemed the colour of blood. On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was surprised to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in the wall, turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured obscurity. It was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious, familiar sequence of sounds in the kitchen, and, listening, identified it as the 134 The War of the Worlds snuffing and scratching of a dog. Going into the kitchen, I saw a dog's nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds. This greatly surprised me. At the scent of me he barked shortly. I thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly I should be able, perhaps, to kill and eat him; and in any case, it would be advisable to kill him, lest his actions attracted the attention of the Martians. I crept forward, saying ""Good dog!"" very softly; but he suddenly withdrew his head and disappeared. I listened--I was not deaf--but certainly the pit was still. I heard a sound like the flutter of a bird's wings, and a hoarse croaking, but that was all. For a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring to move aside the red plants that obscured it. Once or twice I heard a faint pitter- patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither on the sand far below me, and there were more birdlike sounds, but that was all. At length, encouraged by the silence, I looked out. Except in the corner, where a multitude of crows hopped and fought over the skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed, there was not a living thing in the pit. I stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes. All the machinery had gone. Save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one corner, certain bars of aluminium in another, the black birds, and the skeletons of the killed, the place was merely an empty circular pit in the sand. Slowly I thrust myself out through the red weed, and stood upon the mound of rubble. I could see in any direction save behind me, to the north, and neither Martians nor sign of Martians were to be seen. The pit dropped sheerly from my feet, but a little way along the rubbish afforded a prac- ticable slope to the summit of the ruins. My chance of escape had come. I began to tremble. I hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of desperate resolution, and with a heart that throbbed violently, I scrambled to the top of the mound in which I had been buried so long. I looked about again. To the northward, too, no Martian was visible. When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had been a 135 The War of the Worlds straggling street of comfortable white and red houses, interspersed with abundant shady trees. Now I stood on a mound of smashed brickwork, clay, and gravel, over which spread a multitude of red cactus-shaped plants, knee-high, without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute their footing. The trees near me were dead and brown, but further a network of red thread scaled the still living stems. The neighbouring houses had all been wrecked, but none had been burned; their walls stood, sometimes to the second story, with smashed windows and shattered doors. The red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless rooms. Below me was the great pit, with the crows struggling for its refuse.",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",60,"A number of other birds hopped about among the ruins. Far away I saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall, but traces of men there were none. The day seemed, by contrast with my recent confinement, dazzlingly bright, the sky a glowing blue. A gentle breeze kept the red weed that covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying. And oh! the sweetness of the air! 136 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER SIX THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS For some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety. Within that noisome den from which I had emerged I had thought with a narrow intensity only of our immediate security. I had not realised what had been hap- pening to the world, had not anticipated this startling vision of unfamiliar things. I had expected to see Sheen in ruins-- I found about me the landscape, weird and lurid, of another planet. For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range of men, yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well. I felt as a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations of a house. I felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense of dethronement, a persuasion that I was no longer a master, but an animal among the animals, under the Martian heel. With us it would be as with them, to lurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire of man had passed away. But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and my dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast. In the direction away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch of garden ground un- buried. This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep, and sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed. The density of the weed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding. The wall was some six feet high, and when I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my feet to the crest. So I went along by the side of it, and came to a corner and a rockwork that enabled me to get to the top, and tumble into the garden I coveted. Here I found some young onions, a couple of gladiolus bulbs, and a quantity of immature carrots, all of which I secured, and, scrambling over a ruined wall, went on my way through scarlet and crimson trees towards Kew-- it was like walking through an avenue of gigantic blood drops--possessed with two ideas: to get more food, and to limp, as soon and as far as my 137 The War of the Worlds strength permitted, out of this accursed unearthly region of the pit. Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mush- rooms which also I devoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow water, where meadows used to be. These fragments of nourishment served only to whet my hunger. At first I was surprised at this flood in a hot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the tropical exuberance of the red weed. Directly this extraor- dinary growth encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of unparalleled fecundity. Its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the Wey and Thames, and its swiftly growing and Titanic water fronds speedily choked both those rivers. At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in a tangle of this weed, and at Richmond, too, the Thames water poured in a broad and shallow stream across the meadows of Hampton and Twickenham. As the water spread the weed followed them, until the ruined villas of the Thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp, whose margin I explored, and much of the desolation the Martians had caused was concealed. In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread. A cankering disease, due, it is believed, to the action of certain bacteria, presently seized upon it. Now by the action of natural selection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power against bacterial diseases--they never succumb without a severe struggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead. The fronds became bleached, and then shrivelled and brittle. They broke off at the least touch, and the waters that had stimulated their early growth carried their last vestiges out to sea. My first act on coming to this water was, of course, to slake my thirst. I drank a",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",61,"great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawed some fronds of red weed; but they were watery, and had a sickly, metallic taste. I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to wade securely, although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the flood evidently got deeper towards the river, and I turned back to Mortlake. I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins of its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of this spate and made my way to the hill going 138 The War of the Worlds up towards Roehampton and came out on Putney Common. Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation of a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly undisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors closed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as if their inhabitants slept within. The red weed was less abundant; the tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper. I hunted for food among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple of silent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked. I rested for the remainder of the day- light in a shrubbery, being, in my enfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on. All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians. I encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried circuitously away from the advances I made them. Near Roehampton I had seen two human skeletons-- not bodies, but skeletons, picked clean--and in the wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bones of several cats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep. But though I gnawed parts of these in my mouth, there was nothing to be got from them. After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason. And in the garden beyond Roehampton I got a quan- tity of immature potatoes, sufficient to stay my hunger. From this garden one looked down upon Putney and the river. The aspect of the place in the dusk was singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and down the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the weed. And over all--silence. It filled me with indescribable terror to think how swiftly that desolating change had come. For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence, and that I stood there alone, the last man left alive. Hard by the top of Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms dislocated and removed several yards from the rest of the body. As I proceeded I became more and more convinced that the extermination of mankind was, save for such stragglers as myself, already accomplished in this part of the world. 139 The War of the Worlds The Martians, I thought, had gone on and left the country desolated, seeking food elsewhere. Perhaps even now they were destroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone northward. 140 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER SEVEN THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney Hill, sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to Leatherhead. I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into that house--afterwards I found the front door was on the latch--nor how I ransacked every room for food, until just on the verge of despair, in what seemed to me to be a servant's bedroom, I found a rat- gnawed crust and two tins of pineapple. The place had been already searched and emptied. In the bar I afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches that had been over- looked. The latter I could not eat, they were too rotten, but the former not only stayed my hunger, but filled my pockets. I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian might come beating that part of London for food in the night. Before I went to bed I had an interval of restlessness, and prowled from window to window, peering out for some sign of these monsters. I slept little. As I lay in bed I found myself think- ing consecutively--a thing I do not remember to have done since my last argument with the curate. During all the inter- vening time my mental condition had been a hurrying suc- cession of vague emotional states or a sort of stupid recep- tivity. But in the night my brain, reinforced, I suppose,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",62,"by the food I had eaten, grew clear again, and I thought. Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of the curate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of my wife. The former gave me no sensa- tion of horror or remorse to recall; I saw it simply as a thing done, a memory infinitely disagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse. I saw myself then as I see myself now, driven step by step towards that hasty blow, the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that. I felt no condemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted me. In the silence of the night, with that sense of the near- ness of God that sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stood my trial, my only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear. I retraced every step of our conversation from the moment when I had 141 The War of the Worlds found him crouching beside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing to the fire and smoke that streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge. We had been incapable of co-operation--grim chance had taken no heed of that. Had I foreseen, I should have left him at Halliford. But I did not foresee; and crime is to foresee and do. And I set this down as I have set all this story down, as it was. There were no witnesses--all these things I might have con- cealed. But I set it down, and the reader must form his judgment as he will. And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife. For the former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so, unhappily, I could for the latter. And suddenly that night became terrible. I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark. I found my- self praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and painlessly struck her out of being. Since the night of my return from Leatherhead I had not prayed. I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers, had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now I prayed indeed, plead- ing steadfastly and sanely, face to face with the darkness of God. Strange night! Strangest in this, that so soon as dawn had come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house like a rat leaving its hiding place--a creature scarcely larger, an inferior animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be hunted and killed. Perhaps they also prayed confidently to God. Surely, if we have learned noth- ing else, this war has taught us pity--pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion. The morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink, and was fretted with little golden clouds. In the road that runs from the top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the panic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday night after the fighting began. There was a little two-wheeled cart inscribed with the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, with a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat trampled into the now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot of blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough. My movements were languid, my plans of the vaguest. I had an idea of going to Leatherhead, though I knew that 142 The War of the Worlds there I had the poorest chance of finding my wife. Certainly, unless death had overtaken them sud- denly, my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to me I might find or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled. I knew I wanted to find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the world of men, but I had no clear idea how the finding might be done. I was also sharply aware now of my intense loneliness. From the corner I went, under cover of a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of Wimbledon Common, stretching wide and far. That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom; there was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the verge of the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and vitality. I came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the trees. I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from their stout resolve to live. And presently, turning suddenly, with an odd feeling",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",63,"of being watched, I beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes. I stood regarding this. I made a step towards it, and it rose up and became a man armed with a cutlass. I approached him slowly. He stood silent and motionless, regarding me. As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and filthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged through a culvert. Nearer, I distin- guished the green slime of ditches mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches. His black hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and sunken, so that at first I did not recognise him. There was a red cut across the lower part of his face. ""Stop!"" he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and I stopped. His voice was hoarse. ""Where do you come from?"" he said. I thought, surveying him. ""I come from Mortlake,"" I said. ""I was buried near the pit the Martians made about their cylinder. I have worked my way out and escaped."" ""There is no food about here,"" he said. ""This is my coun- try. All this hill down to the river, and back to Clapham, and up to the edge of the common. There is only food for one. Which way are you going?"" 143 The War of the Worlds I answered slowly. ""I don't know,"" I said. ""I have been buried in the ruins of a house thirteen or fourteen days. I don't know what has happened."" He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with a changed expression. ""I've no wish to stop about here,"" said I. ""I think I shall go to Leatherhead, for my wife was there."" He shot out a pointing finger. ""It is you,"" said he; ""the man from Woking. And you weren't killed at Weybridge?"" I recognised him at the same moment. ""You are the artilleryman who came into my garden."" ""Good luck!"" he said. ""We are lucky ones! Fancy YOU!"" He put out a hand, and I took it. ""I crawled up a drain,"" he said. ""But they didn't kill everyone. And after they went away I got off towards Walton across the fields. But---- It's not sixteen days altogether--and your hair is grey."" He looked over his shoulder suddenly. ""Only a rook,"" he said. ""One gets to know that birds have shadows these days. This is a bit open. Let us crawl under those bushes and talk."" ""Have you seen any Martians?"" I said. ""Since I crawled out----"" ""They've gone away across London,"" he said. ""I guess they've got a bigger camp there. Of a night, all over there, Hampstead way, the sky is alive with their lights. It's like a great city, and in the glare you can just see them moving. By daylight you can't. But nearer--I haven't seen them--"" (he counted on his fingers) ""five days. Then I saw a couple across Hammersmith way carrying something big. And the night before last""--he stopped and spoke impressively--""it was just a matter of lights, but it was something up in the air. I believe they've built a flying-machine, and are learn- ing to fly."" I stopped, on hands and knees, for we had come to the bushes. ""Fly!"" ""Yes,"" he said, ""fly."" I went on into a little bower, and sat down. ""It is all over with humanity,"" I said. ""If they can do that they will 144 The War of the Worlds simply go round the world."" He nodded. ""They will. But---- It will relieve things over here a bit. And besides-- --"" He looked at me. ""Aren't you satisfied it IS up with humanity? I am. We're down; we're beat."" I stared. Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this fact--a fact perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke. I had still held a vague hope; rather, I had kept a lifelong habit of mind. He repeated his words, ""We're beat."" They carried absolute conviction. ""It's all over,"" he said. ""They've lost ONE--just ONE. And they've made their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world. They've walked over us. The death of that one at Weybridge was an accident. And these are only pioneers. They kept on coming. These green stars--I've seen none these five or six days, but I've no doubt they're falling somewhere every night. Nothing's to be done. We're under! We're beat!"" I made him no answer. I sat staring before me, trying in vain to devise some countervailing thought. ""This isn't a war,"" said the artilleryman. ""It never was a war, any more than there's war between man and ants."" Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory. ""After the",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",64,"tenth shot they fired no more--at least, until the first cylinder came."" ""How do you know?"" said the artilleryman. I explained. He thought. ""Something wrong with the gun,"" he said. ""But what if there is? They'll get it right again. And even if there's a delay, how can it alter the end? It's just men and ants. There's the ants builds their cities, live their lives, have wars, revolutions, until the men want them out of the way, and then they go out of the way. That's what we are now--just ants. Only----"" ""Yes,"" I said. ""We're eatable ants."" We sat looking at each other. ""And what will they do with us?"" I said. ""That's what I've been thinking,"" he said; ""that's what I've been thinking. After Weybridge I went south--thinking. I saw what was up. 145 The War of the Worlds Most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves. But I'm not so fond of squealing. I've been in sight of death once or twice; I'm not an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst, death-- it's just death. And it's the man that keeps on thinking comes through. I saw everyone tracking away south. Says I, ""Food won't last this way,"" and I turned right back. I went for the Martians like a sparrow goes for man. All round""--he waved a hand to the horizon--""they're starving in heaps, bolting, treading on each other. . . ."" He saw my face, and halted awkwardly. ""No doubt lots who had money have gone away to France,"" he said. He seemed to hesitate whether to apolo- gise, met my eyes, and went on: ""There's food all about here. Canned things in shops; wines, spirits, mineral waters; and the water mains and drains are empty. Well, I was telling you what I was thinking. ""Here's intelligent things,"" I said, ""and it seems they want us for food. First, they'll smash us up--ships, machines, guns, cities, all the order and organisa- tion. All that will go. If we were the size of ants we might pull through. But we're not. It's all too bulky to stop. That's the first certainty."" Eh?"" I assented. ""It is; I've thought it out. Very well, then--next; at present we're caught as we're wanted. A Martian has only to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run. And I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth, picking houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage. But they won't keep on doing that. So soon as they've settled all our guns and ships, and smashed our railways, and done all the things they are doing over there, they will begin catching us systematic, pick- ing the best and storing us in cages and things. That's what they will start doing in a bit. Lord! They haven't begun on us yet. Don't you see that?"" ""Not begun!"" I exclaimed. ""Not begun. All that's happened so far is through our not having the sense to keep quiet--worrying them with guns and such foolery. And losing our heads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn't any more safety than where we were. They don't want to bother us yet. They're making their things--making all the things they couldn't bring with them, 146 The War of the Worlds getting things ready for the rest of their people. Very likely that's why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear of hitting those who are here. And instead of our rush- ing about blind, on the howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up, we've got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs. That's how I figure it out. It isn't quite according to what a man wants for his species, but it's about what the facts point to. And that's the principle I acted upon. Cities, nations, civilisation, progress- -it's all over. That game's up. We're beat."" ""But if that is so, what is there to live for?"" The artilleryman looked at me for a moment. ""There won't be any more blessed concerts for a million years or so; there won't be any Royal Academy of Arts, and no nice little feeds at restaurants. If it's amusement you're after, I reckon the game is up. If you've got any drawing- room manners or a dislike to eating peas with a knife or dropping aitches, you'd better chuck 'em away. They ain't no further use."" ""You mean----"" ""I mean that men like me are going on living--for the sake of the breed. I tell you, I'm grim set on living. And if I'm not mistaken, you'll show what insides YOU'VE got, too, before long. We aren't going to be exterminated. And I don't mean to be",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",65,"caught either, and tamed and fattened and bred like a thundering ox. Ugh! Fancy those brown creepers!"" ""You don't mean to say----"" ""I do. I'm going on, under their feet. I've got it planned; I've thought it out. We men are beat. We don't know enough. We've got to learn before we've got a chance. And we've got to live and keep independent while we learn. See! That's what has to be done."" I stared, astonished, and stirred profoundly by the man's resolution. ""Great God!,"" cried I. ""But you are a man indeed!"" And suddenly I gripped his hand. ""Eh!"" he said, with his eyes shining. ""I've thought it out, eh?"" ""Go on,"" I said. ""Well, those who mean to escape their catching must get ready. I'm getting ready. Mind you, it isn't all of us that are made for wild beasts; and 147 The War of the Worlds that's what it's got to be. That's why I watched you. I had my doubts. You're slender. I didn't know that it was you, you see, or just how you'd been buried. All these--the sort of people that lived in these houses, and all those damn little clerks that used to live down that way--they'd be no good. They haven't any spirit in them--no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn't one or the other--Lord! What is he but funk and precautions? They just used to skedaddle off to work--I've seen hundreds of 'em, bit of breakfast in hand, running wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket train, for fear they'd get dismissed if they didn't; working at businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to under- stand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldn't be in time for dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the back streets, and sleeping with the wives they married, not be- cause they wanted them, but because they had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little mis- erable skedaddle through the world. Lives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents. And on Sundays--fear of the hereafter. As if hell was built for rabbits! Well, the Mar- tians will just be a godsend to these. Nice roomy cages, fat- tening food, careful breeding, no worry. After a week or so chasing about the fields and lands on empty stomachs, they'll come and be caught cheerful. They'll be quite glad after a bit. They'll wonder what people did before there were Martians to take care of them. And the bar loafers, and mashers, and singers--I can imagine them. I can imagine them,"" he said, with a sort of sombre gratification. ""There'll be any amount of sentiment and religion loose among them. There's hundreds of things I saw with my eyes that I've only begun to see clearly these last few days. There's lots will take things as they are--fat and stupid; and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it's all wrong, and that they ought to be doing something. Now whenever things are so that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing some- thing, the weak, and those who go weak with a lot of com- plicated thinking, always make for a sort of do-nothing religion, very pious and superior, and submit to persecution and the will of the Lord. Very likely you've seen the same thing. It's energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean inside out. These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety. And those of a less simple sort will work in a bit of-- 148 The War of the Worlds what is it?--eroticism."" He paused. ""Very likely these Martians will make pets of some of them; train them to do tricks--who knows?--get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed. And some, maybe, they will train to hunt us."" ""No,"" I cried, ""that's impossible! No human being----"" ""What's the good of going on with such lies?"" said the artilleryman. ""There's men who'd do it cheerful. What non- sense to pretend there isn't!"" And I succumbed to his conviction. ""If they come after me,"" he said; ""Lord, if they come after me!"" and subsided into a grim meditation. I sat contemplating these things. I could find nothing to bring against this man's reasoning. In the days before the invasion no one would have questioned my intellectual superiority to his--I, a professed and recognised writer on philosophical themes, and he, a common soldier; and yet he had already formulated a situation that I had scarcely realised. ""What are you doing?"" I said presently. ""What plans have you made?"" He hesitated. ""Well, it's like this,"" he said. ""What have we to do? We have",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",66,"to invent a sort of life where men can live and breed, and be sufficiently secure to bring the children up. Yes--wait a bit, and I'll make it clearer what I think ought to be done. The tame ones will go like all tame beasts; in a few genera- tions they'll be big, beautiful, rich-blooded, stupid--rubbish! The risk is that we who keep wild will go savage--de- generate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . . You see, how I mean to live is underground. I've been thinking about the drains. Of course those who don't know drains think horrible things; but under this London are miles and miles--hundreds of miles--and a few days"" rain and London empty will leave them sweet and clean. The main drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone. Then there's cellars, vaults, stores, from which bolting passages may be made to the drains. And the railway tunnels and subways. Eh? You begin to see? And we form a band--able-bodied, clean-minded men. We're not going to 149 The War of the Worlds pick up any rubbish that drifts in. Weaklings go out again."" ""As you meant me to go?"" ""Well--l parleyed, didn't I?"" ""We won't quarrel about that. Go on."" ""Those who stop obey orders. Able-bodied, clean-minded women we want also--mothers and teachers. No lackadaisical ladies--no blasted rolling eyes. We can't have any weak or silly. Life is real again, and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die. They ought to die. They ought to be willing to die. It's a sort of disloyalty, after all, to live and taint the race. And they can't be happy. Moreover, dying's none so dreadful; it's the funking makes it bad. And in all those places we shall gather. Our district will be London. And we may even be able to keep a watch, and run about in the open when the Martians keep away. Play cricket, per- haps. That's how we shall save the race. Eh? It's a possible thing? But saving the race is nothing in itself. As I say, that's only being rats. It's saving our knowledge and adding to it is the thing. There men like you come in. There's books, there's models. We must make great safe places down deep, and get all the books we can; not novels and poetry swipes, but ideas, science books. That's where men like you come in. We must go to the British Museum and pick all those books through. Especially we must keep up our science-- learn more. We must watch these Martians. Some of us must go as spies. When it's all working, perhaps I will. Get caught, I mean. And the great thing is, we must leave the Martians alone. We mustn't even steal. If we get in their way, we clear out. We must show them we mean no harm. Yes, I know. But they're intelligent things, and they won't hunt us down if they have all they want, and think we're just harmless vermin."" The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm. ""After all, it may not be so much we may have to learn before-- Just imagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly starting off-- Heat-Rays right and left, and not a Martian in 'em. Not a Martian in 'em, but men--men who have learned the way how. It may be in my time, even- - those men. Fancy having one of them lovely things, with its Heat-Ray wide and free! Fancy having it in control! What would it matter if you 150 The War of the Worlds smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a bust like that? I reckon the Martians'll open their beautiful eyes! Can't you see them, man? Can't you see them hurrying, hurrying--puffing and blowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs? Something out of gear in every case. And swish, bang, rattle, swish! Just as they are fum- bling over it, SWISH comes the Heat-Ray, and, behold! man has come back to his own."" For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and the tone of assurance and courage he assumed, com- pletely dominated my mind. I believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in the practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the reader who thinks me sus- ceptible and foolish must contrast his position, reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine, crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening, distracted by apprehension. We talked in this manner through the early morning time, and later crept out of the bushes, and, after scanning the sky for Martians, hurried precipitately to the house on Putney Hill where he had made his lair. It was the",yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",67,"coal cellar of the place, and when I saw the work he had spent a week upon--it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long, which he designed to reach to the main drain on Putney Hill--I had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his powers. Such a hole I could have dug in a day. But I believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday at his digging. We had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range. We refreshed ourselves with a tin of mock- turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry. I found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the world in this steady labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in my mind, and presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I worked there all the morning, so glad was I to find myself with a purpose again. After working an hour I began to speculate on the distance one had to go before the cloaca was reached, the chances we had of missing it altogether. My immediate trouble was why we should dig this long tunnel, when it was possible to get into the drain at once down one of the manholes, and work back to the house. It seemed to me, too, that the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a needless length of tunnel. And just as I was beginning to face these things, the artilleryman stopped 151 The War of the Worlds digging, and looked at me. ""We're working well,"" he said. He put down his spade. ""Let us knock off a bit"" he said. ""I think it's time we recon- noitred from the roof of the house."" I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade; and then suddenly I was struck by a thought. I stopped, and so did he at once. ""Why were you walking about the common,"" I said, ""instead of being here?"" ""Taking the air,"" he said. ""I was coming back. It's safer by night."" ""But the work?"" ""Oh, one can't always work,"" he said, and in a flash I saw the man plain. He hesitated, holding his spade. ""We ought to reconnoitre now,"" he said, ""because if any come near they may hear the spades and drop upon us unawares."" I was no longer disposed to object. We went together to the roof and stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door. No Martians were to be seen, and we ventured out on the tiles, and slipped down under shelter of the parapet. From this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of Putney, but we could see the river below, a bubbly mass of red weed, and the low parts of Lambeth flooded and red. The red creeper swarmed up the trees about the old palace, and their branches stretched gaunt and dead, and set with shrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters. It was strange how entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing water for their propagation. About us neither had gained a footing; laburnums, pink mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor- vitae, rose out of laurels and hydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight. Beyond Kensington dense smoke was rising, and that and a blue haze hid the northward hills. The artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still remained in London. ""One night last week,"" he said, ""some fools got the electric light in order, and there was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze, crowded with painted and ragged drunkards, men and women, dancing and shouting till 152 The War of the Worlds dawn. A man who was there told me. And as the day came they became aware of a fighting-machine standing near by the Langham and look- ing down at them. Heaven knows how long he had been there. It must have given some of them a nasty turn. He came down the road towards them, and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened to run away."" Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe! From that, in answer to my questions, he came round to his grandiose plans again. He grew enthusiastic. He talked so eloquently of the possibility of capturing a fighting- machine that I more than half believed in him again. But now that I was beginning to understand something of his quality, I could divine the stress he laid on doing nothing precipitately. And I noted that now there was no question that he personally was to capture and fight the great machine. After a time we went down to the cellar. Neither of us seemed disposed to resume",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",68,"digging, and when he suggested a meal, I was nothing loath. He became suddenly very generous, and when we had eaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars. We lit these, and his optimism glowed. He was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion. ""There's some champagne in the cellar,"" he said. ""We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy,"" said I. ""No,"" said he; ""I am host today. Champagne! Great God! We've a heavy enough task before us! Let us take a rest and gather strength while we may. Look at these blistered hands!"" And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon playing cards after we had eaten. He taught me euchre, and after dividing London between us, I taking the northern side and he the southern, we played for parish points. Grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober reader, it is abso- lutely true, and what is more remarkable, I found the card game and several others we played extremely interesting. Strange mind of man! that, with our species upon the edge of extermination or appalling degradation, with no clear prospect before us but the chance of a horrible death, we could sit following the chance of this painted pasteboard, and playing the ""joker"" with vivid delight. 153 The War of the Worlds Afterwards he taught me poker, and I beat him at three tough chess games. When dark came we decided to take the risk, and lit a lamp. After an interminable string of games, we supped, and the artilleryman finished the champagne. We went on smoking the cigars. He was no longer the energetic regenerator of his species I had encountered in the morning. He was still optimistic, but it was a less kinetic, a more thoughtful optimism. I remember he wound up with my health, proposed in a speech of small variety and considerable intermittence. I took a cigar, and went upstairs to look at the lights of which he had spoken that blazed so greenly along the Highgate hills. At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley. The northern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington glowed redly, and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed up and vanished in the deep blue night. All the rest of London was black. Then, nearer, I perceived a strange light, a pale, violet-purple fluorescent glow, quivering under the night breeze. For a space I could not understand it, and then I knew that it must be the red weed from which this faint irradiation proceeded. With that realisation my dormant sense of wonder, my sense of the proportion of things, awoke again. I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear, glowing high in the west, and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of Hampstead and Highgate. I remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at the grotesque changes of the day. I recalled my mental states from the midnight prayer to the foolish card-playing. I had a violent revulsion of feeling. I remember I flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful symbolism. My folly came to me with glaring exaggeration. I seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind; I was filled with remorse. I resolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to his drink and gluttony, and to go on into London. There, it seemed to me, I had the best chance of learning what the Martians and my fellowmen were doing. I was still upon the roof when the late moon rose. 154 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER EIGHT DEAD LONDON After I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and by the High Street across the bridge to Fulham. The red weed was tumultuous at that time, and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that presently removed it so swiftly. At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I found a man lying. He was as black as a sweep with the black dust, alive, but helplessly and speechlessly drunk. I could get nothing from him but curses and furious lunges at my head. I think I should have stayed by him but for the brutal expression of his face. There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, and it grew thicker in Fulham. The streets were horribly quiet. I got food-- sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite eatable--in a baker's shop here. Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of powder, and I passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of the burning was an absolute relief.

"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",69,"towards Brompton, the streets were quiet again. Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon dead bodies. I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the Fulham Road. They had been dead many days, so that I hurried quickly past them. The black powder covered them over, and softened their outlines. One or two had been disturbed by dogs. Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday in the City, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds drawn, the desertion, and the stillness. In some places plunderers had been at work, but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops. A jeweller's window had been broken open in one place, but apparently the thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains and a watch lay scattered on the pavement. I did not trouble to touch them. Farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the hand that hung over her knee was 155 The War of the Worlds gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress, and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement. She seemed asleep, but she was dead. The farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the stillness. But it was not so much the stillness of death-- it was the stillness of suspense, of expectation. At any time the destruction that had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis, and had annihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might strike among these houses and leave them smoking ruins. It was a city condemned and derelict. . . . In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder. It was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling. It crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses. It was a sobbing alternation of two notes, ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" keeping on perpetually. When I passed streets that ran northward it grew in volume, and houses and buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again. It came in a full tide down Exhibition Road. I stopped, staring towards Kensington Gardens, wondering at this strange, remote wailing. It was as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude. ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" wailed that superhuman note-- great waves of sound sweeping down the broad, sunlit road- way, between the tall buildings on each side. I turned north- wards, marvelling, towards the iron gates of Hyde Park. I had half a mind to break into the Natural History Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers, in order to see across the park. But I decided to keep to the ground, where quick hiding was possible, and so went on up the Exhibition Road. All the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and still, and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses. At the top, near the park gate, I came upon a strange sight--a bus overturned, and the skeleton of a horse picked clean. I puzzled over this for a time, and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine. The voice grew stronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above the housetops on the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke to the northwest. ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to me, from the district about Regent's Park. The desolating cry worked upon my 156 The War of the Worlds mind. The mood that had sustained me passed. The wailing took possession of me. I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and now again hungry and thirsty. It was already past noon. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the dead? Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and in its black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely. My mind ran on old friends that I had forgotten for years. I thought of the poisons in the chemists"" shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I recalled the two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew, shared the city with myself. . . . I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were black powder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the gratings of the cellars of some of the houses. I grew very thirsty after the heat of my long walk. With infinite trouble I managed to break into a public-house and get food and drink. I was weary after eating, and went into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black horse- hair sofa I found there. I awoke to find",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",70,"that dismal howling still in my ears, ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla."" It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some biscuits and a cheese in the bar--there was a meat safe, but it contained nothing but maggots--I wan- dered on through the silent residential squares to Baker Street --Portman Square is the only one I can name--and so came out at last upon Regent's Park. And as I emerged from the top of Baker Street, I saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset the hood of the Martian giant from which this howling proceeded. I was not terrified. I came upon him as if it were a matter of course. I watched him for some time, but he did not move. He appeared to be standing and yelling, for no reason that I could discover. I tried to formulate a plan of action. That perpetual sound of ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" confused my mind. Perhaps I was too tired to be very fearful. Certainly I was more curious to know the reason of this monotonous crying than afraid. I turned back away from the park and struck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went along under the shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this stationary, howling Martian from the direction of St. John's Wood. A couple of hundred yards out of 157 The War of the Worlds Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus, and saw, first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong towards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him. He made a wide curve to avoid me, as though he feared I might prove a fresh competitor. As the yelping died away down the silent road, the wailing sound of ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" reasserted itself. I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John's Wood station. At first I thought a house had fallen across the road. It was only as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with a start, this mechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed and twisted, among the ruins it had made. The forepart was shattered. It seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had been over- whelmed in its overthrow. It seemed to me then that this might have happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its Martian. I could not clamber among the ruins to see it, and the twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat was smeared, and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had left, were invisible to me. Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on towards Primrose Hill. Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a second Martian, as motionless as the first, standing in the park towards the Zoological Gardens, and silent. A little beyond the ruins about the smashed handling- machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the Regent's Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation. As I crossed the bridge, the sound of ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" ceased. It was, as it were, cut off. The silence came like a thunderclap. The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees towards the park were growing black. All about me the red weed clambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness. Night, the mother of fear and mystery, was coming upon me. But while that voice sounded the solitude, the desolation, had been endurable; by virtue of it London had still seemed alive, and the sense of life about me had upheld me. Then suddenly a change, the passing of something--I knew not what--and then a stillness that could be felt. Nothing but this gaunt quiet. 158 The War of the Worlds London about me gazed at me spectrally. The windows in the white houses were like the eye sockets of skulls. About me my imagination found a thousand noiseless enemies moving. Terror seized me, a horror of my temerity. In front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway. I could not bring myself to go on. I turned down St. John's Wood Road, and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn. I hid from the night and the silence, until long after midnight, in a cabmen's shelter in Harrow Road. But before the dawn my courage returned, and while the stars were still in the sky I turned once more towards Regent's Park. I missed my way among the streets, and presently saw down",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",71,"a long avenue, in the half-light of the early dawn, the curve of Primrose Hill. On the summit, towering up to the fading stars, was a third Martian, erect and motionless like the others. An insane resolve possessed me. I would die and end it. And I would save myself even the trouble of killing myself. I marched on recklessly towards this Titan, and then, as I drew nearer and the light grew, I saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about the hood. At that my heart gave a bound, and I began running along the road. I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund's Terrace (I waded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from the waterworks towards the Albert Road), and emerged upon the grass before the rising of the sun. Great mounds had been heaped about the crest of the hill, making a huge redoubt of it--it was the final and largest place the Martians had made--and from behind these heaps there rose a thin smoke against the sky. Against the sky line an eager dog ran and disappeared. The thought that had flashed into my mind grew real, grew credible. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation, as I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster. Out of the hood hung lank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birds pecked and tore. In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen ram- part and stood upon its crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me. A mighty space it was, with gigantic machines here and there within it, huge mounds of material and strange shelter places. And scattered about it, 159 The War of the Worlds some in their over- turned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling- machines, and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row, were the Martians--DEAD!--slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unpre- pared; slain as the red weed was being slain; slain, after all man's devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth. For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds. These germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things--taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here. But by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to many-- those that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance --our living frames are altogether immune. But there are no bacteria in Mars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly they drank and fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow. Already when I watched them they were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to and fro. It was inevitable. By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten times as mighty as they are. For neither do men live nor die in vain. Here and there they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in that great gulf they had made, overtaken by a death that must have seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be. To me also at that time this death was incompre- hensible. All I knew was that these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead. For a moment I believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain them in the night. I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened glori- ously, even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays. The pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines, so great and wonderful in their power and com- plexity, so unearthly in their tortuous forms, rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows towards the light. A multitude of dogs, I could hear, fought over the bodies that lay darkly in the depth of the pit, far below me. Across the pit on its farther lip, flat and vast and 160 The War of the Worlds strange, lay the great flying-machine with which they had been experimenting upon our denser atmosphere when decay and death arrested them. Death had come not a day too soon. At the sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at the huge fighting-machine that would fight no more for ever, at the tattered red shreds of flesh",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",72,"that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit of Primrose Hill. I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where, enhaloed now in birds, stood those other two Martians that I had seen overnight, just as death had overtaken them. The one had died, even as it had been crying to its companions; perhaps it was the last to die, and its voice had gone on perpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted. They glittered now, harmless tripod towers of shining metal, in the brightness of the rising sun. All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from ever- lasting destruction, stretched the great Mother of Cities. Those who have only seen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses. Eastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and the splintered spire of the church, the sun blazed daz- zling in a clear sky, and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught the light and glared with a white intensity. Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses; westward the great city was dimmed; and southward, beyond the Martians, the green waves of Regent's Park, the Langham Hotel, the dome of the Albert Hall, the Imperial Institute, and the giant mansions of the Brompton Road came out clear and little in the sunrise, the jagged ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond. Far away and blue were the Surrey hills, and the towers of the Crystal Palace glittered like two silver rods. The dome of St. Paul's was dark against the sunrise, and injured, I saw for the first time, by a huge gaping cavity on its western side. And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and fac- tories and churches, silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous hopes and efforts, the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this human reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung over it 161 The War of the Worlds all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolled back, and that men might still live in the streets, and this dear vast dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave of emotion that was near akin to tears. The torment was over. Even that day the healing would begin. The survivors of the people scattered over the coun- try--leaderless, lawless, foodless, like sheep without a shep- herd--the thousands who had fled by sea, would begin to return; the pulse of life, growing stronger and stronger, would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the vacant squares. Whatever destruction was done, the hand of the destroyer was stayed. All the gaunt wrecks, the black- ened skeletons of houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the hill, would presently be echoing with the ham- mers of the restorers and ringing with the tapping of their trowels. At the thought I extended my hands towards the sky and began thanking God. In a year, thought I--in a year. . . With overwhelming force came the thought of myself, of my wife, and the old life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever. 162 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER NINE WRECKAGE And now comes the strangest thing in my story. Yet, perhaps, it is not altogether strange. I remember, clearly and coldly and vividly, all that I did that day until the time that I stood weeping and praising God upon the summit of Prim- rose Hill. And then I forget. Of the next three days I know nothing. I have learned since that, so far from my being the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow, several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the previous night. One man-- the first--had gone to St. Martin's-le-Grand, and, while I sheltered in the cabmen's hut, had contrived to telegraph to Paris. Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world; a thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, sud- denly flashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the verge of the pit. Already men, weep- ing with joy, as I have heard, shouting and staying their work to shake hands and shout, were making up trains, even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London. The church bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news, until all England was bell-ringing. Men on cycles, lean-faced, unkempt, scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance, shouting to gaunt, staring figures of despair. And for the",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",73,"food! Across the Channel, across the Irish Sea, across the Atlantic, corn, bread, and meat were tearing to our relief. All the shipping in the world seemed going Londonward in those days. But of all this I have no memory. I drifted--a demented man. I found myself in a house of kindly people, who had found me on the third day wandering, weeping, and raving through the streets of St. John's Wood. They have told me since that I was singing some insane doggerel about ""The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah! The Last Man Left Alive!"" Troubled as they were with their own affairs, these people, whose name, much as I would like to express my gratitude to them, I may not even give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves with me, 163 The War of the Worlds sheltered me, and protected me from myself. Apparently they had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse. Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me what they had learned of the fate of Leather- head. Two days after I was imprisoned it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by a Martian. He had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without any provocation, as a boy might crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonness of power. I was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me. I was a lonely man and a sad one, and they bore with me. I remained with them four days after my recovery. All that time I felt a vague, a growing craving to look once more on whatever remained of the little life that seemed so happy and bright in my past. It was a mere hopeless desire to feast upon my misery. They dissuaded me. They did all they could to divert me from this morbidity. But at last I could resist the impulse no longer, and, promising faithfully to return to them, and parting, as I will confess, from these four- day friends with tears, I went out again into the streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty. Already they were busy with returning people; in places even there were shops open, and I saw a drinking fountain running water. I remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on my melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy the streets and vivid the moving life about me. So many people were abroad everywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed incredible that any great proportion of the population could have been slain. But then I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I met, how shaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes, and that every other man still wore his dirty rags. Their faces seemed all with one of two expressions--a leaping exultation and energy or a grim resolution. Save for the expression of the faces, London seemed a city of tramps. The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sent us by the French government. The ribs of the few horses showed dismally. Haggard special constables with white badges stood at the corners of every street. I saw little of the mischief wrought by the Martians until I reached Welling- ton Street, and there I saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses of Waterloo 164 The War of the Worlds Bridge. At the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts of that grotesque time--a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of the red weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place. It was the placard of the first newspaper to resume publication--the DAILY MAIL. I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket. Most of it was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing had amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of ad- vertisement stereo on the back page. The matter he printed was emotional; the news organisation had not as yet found its way back. I learned nothing fresh except that already in one week the examination of the Martian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results. Among other things, the article assured me what I did not believe at the time, that the ""Secret of Flying,"" was discovered. At Waterloo I found the free trains that were taking people to their homes. The first rush was already over. There were few people in the train, and I was in no mood for casual conversation. I got a com- partment to myself, and sat with folded arms, looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows. And just outside the terminus the train",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",74,"jolted over temporary rails, and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins. To Clapham Junction the face of London was grimy with powder of the Black Smoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain, and at Clapham Junc- tion the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds of out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary navvies, and we were jolted over a hasty relaying. All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suf- fered. Walton, by virtue of its unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along the line. The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass of red weed, in appearance between butcher's meat and pickled cabbage. The Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons of the red climber. Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in certain nursery grounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder. A number of people were standing about it, and some sappers were busy in the midst of it. Over it flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully in the morning breeze. 165 The War of the Worlds The nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows, and very painful to the eye. One's gaze went with infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green softness of the eastward hills. The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing repair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to Maybury, past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars, and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in the thunderstorm. Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find, among a tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed. For a time I stood regarding these vestiges. . . . Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here and there, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found burial, and so came home past the College Arms. A man standing at an open cottage door greeted me by name as I passed. I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately. The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I approached. It slammed again. The curtains of my study fluttered out of the open window from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn. No one had closed it since. The smashed bushes were just as I had left them nearly four weeks ago. I stumbled into the hall, and the house felt empty. The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had crouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the catastrophe. Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs. I followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-table still, with the selenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I had left on the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder. For a space I stood reading over my aban- doned arguments. It was a paper on the probable develop- ment of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilising process; and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy: ""In about two hundred years,"" I had written, ""we may expect----"" The sentence ended abruptly. I remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning, scarcely a month 166 The War of the Worlds gone by, and how I had broken off to get my DAILY CHRONICLE from the newsboy. I remembered how I went down to the garden gate as he came along, and how I had listened to his odd story of ""Men from Mars."" I came down and went into the dining room. There were the mutton and the bread, both far gone now in decay, and a beer bottle overturned, just as I and the artilleryman had left them. My home was desolate. I perceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished so long. And then a strange thing occurred. ""It is no use,"" said a voice. ""The house is deserted. No one has been here these ten days. Do not stay here to torment yourself. No one escaped but you."" I was startled. Had I spoken my thought aloud? I turned, and the French window was open behind me. I made a step to it, and stood looking out. And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",75,"were my cousin and my wife--my wife white and tearless. She gave a faint cry. ""I came,"" she said. ""I knew--knew----"" She put her hand to her throat--swayed. I made a step forward, and caught her in my arms. 167 The War of the Worlds CHAPTER TEN THE EPILOGUE I cannot but regret, now that I am concluding my story, how little I am able to contribute to the discussion of the many debatable questions which are still unsettled. In one respect I shall certainly provoke criticism. My particular province is speculative philosophy. My knowledge of com- parative physiology is confined to a book or two, but it seems to me that Carver's suggestions as to the reason of the rapid death of the Martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as a proven conclusion. I have assumed that in the body of my narrative. At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined after the war, no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species were found. That they did not bury any of their dead, and the reckless slaughter they per- petrated, point also to an entire ignorance of the putrefactive process. But probable as this seems, it is by no means a proven conclusion. Neither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which the Martians used with such deadly effect, and the generator of the Heat-Rays remains a puzzle. The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South further Kensington investigations upon the latter. Spectrum analysis of the black powder points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a brilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is pos- sible that it combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood. But such unproven speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader, to whom this story is addressed. None of the brown scum that drifted down the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at the time, and now none is forthcoming. laboratories have disinclined analysts for The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far as the prowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I have already given. But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost complete 168 The War of the Worlds specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and the countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that the interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific. A question of graver and universal interest is the possi- bility of another attack from the Martians. I do not think that nearly enough attention is being given to this aspect of the matter. At present the planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I, for one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure. In any case, we should be prepared. It seems to me that it should be possible to define the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate the arrival of the next attack. In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dyna- mite or artillery before it was sufficiently cool for the Mar- tians to emerge, or they might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened. It seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of their first surprise. Possibly they see it in the same light. Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martians have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus. Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with the sun; that is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view of an observer on Venus. Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous mark- ing appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk. One needs to see the drawings of these ap- pearances in order to appreciate fully their remarkable resemblance in character. At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views of the human future must be greatly modified by these events. We have learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be that in the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene confidence",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
"The War of the Worlds, by H(erbert) G(eorge) Wells [1898] -- geal -- ( WeLib.org )",76,"in the future which is the most fruitful source of decadence, the gifts to human 169 The War of the Worlds science it has brought are enormous, and it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of mankind. It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement. Be that as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men. The broadening of men's views that has resulted can scarcely be exaggerated. Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty surface of our minute sphere. Now we see further. If the Martians can reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet within its toils. Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space. But that is a remote dream. It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of the Martians is only a reprieve. To them, and not to us, perhaps, is the future ordained. I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind. I sit in my study writing by lamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley below set with writhing flames, and feel the house behind and about me empty and desolate. I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles pass me, a butcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on a bicycle, children going to school, and suddenly they become vague and unreal, and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot, brooding silence. Of a night I see the black powder darkening the silent streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise upon me tattered and dog-bitten. They gibber and grow fiercer, paler, uglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and I wake, cold and wretched, in the darkness of the night. I go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the 170 The War of the Worlds Strand, and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the past, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched, going to and fro, phan- tasms in a dead city, the mockery of life in a galvanised body. And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill, as I did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the great province of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and mist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the sight-seers about the Mar- tian machine that stands there still, to hear the tumult of playing children, and to recall the time when I saw it all bright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of that last great day. . . . And strangest of all is it to hold my wife's hand again, and to think that I have counted her, and that she has counted me, among the dead. 171",no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Alice_in_Wonderland,0,"The worlds most precise replica of the worlds most famous childrens book! In 1998, Peter Zelchenko began a project for Volume- One Publishing: to create an exact digital replica of Lewis Carrolls rst edition of Alice. Working with the original 1865 edition and numerous other editions at the Newberry Library in Chicago, Zelchenko created a digital masterpiece in his own right, a testament to the original work of Lewis Carroll (aka Prof. Charles Dodgson) who personally directed the typography for the rst Alice. After much analyis, Peter then painstakingly matched letter to letter, line to line, of his new A L I C ES Adventures in Wonderland BY LEWIS CARROLL ILLUSTRATED BY JOHN TENNIEL digital edition to that of the original. After weeks of toil he created an exact replica of the original! The book was added print-on- to VolumeOnes demand offering. While a PDF version is offered on various portals of the Net, BookVirtual took the project to heart and added its interface designs and programming.

ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, and what is B Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that ; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be too late ! (when she thought it over afterwards, it oc- curred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural) ; but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it ashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waist- coat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the eld after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything : then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves : here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down B 2 Navigate Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 4 DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE. 5 a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it was labelled ORANGE MARMALADE, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing some- body underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. Well ! thought Alice to herself, after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs ! How brave they ll all think me at home",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Alice_in_Wonderland,2,"! Why, I wouldnt say any- thing about it, even if I fell off the top of the house ! (Which was very likely true.) Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end ? I wonder how many miles I ve fallen by this time ? she said aloud. I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see : that would be four thousand miles down, I think (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) yes, that s about the right distancebut then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I ve got to ? (Alice had not the slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.) Presently she began again. I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth ! How funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards ! The Anti- pathies, I think (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn t sound at all the right word) but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Maam, is this New Zealand or Australia ? (and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as you re falling through the air ! Do you think you could manage it ?) And what an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking ! No, it ll never do to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere. Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. Dinah ll miss me very much to-night, I should think ! (Dinah was the cat.) I hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear ! I wish you were down here with me ! There are no mice in the air, Im afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder ? And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, Do cats eat bats ? Do cats eat bats ? and sometimes, Do bats eat cats ? for, you see, as she couldnt answer either question, it didnt much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to her very earnestly, Now, Dinah, tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ? when suddenly, thump ! thump ! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up, but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost : away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it s getting ! She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked, and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alices rst idea was that this might belong to one of the Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved.

However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed be- fore, and be- it was hind little door a fifteen about high : inches she tried the golden little the key in lock, and to her great delight it tted ! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright owers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway ; and even if my head would go through, thought poor Alice, it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope ! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin. For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might nd another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it, ( which certainly was not here before, said Alice,) and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words DRINK ME beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very well to say Drink me, but the wise little Alice was not going to do that Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 10 DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE. 11 in a hurry: no, I ll look first, she said, and see whether it s marked poison or not : for she had read several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they would not re- member the simple rules their friends had taught them, such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked poison, it is almost certain to dis- agree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle was not marked poison, so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed avour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon nished it off. * * * * * * * * * * * What a curious feeling ! said Alice, I must be shutting up like a telescope. And so it was indeed : she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further : she felt a little nervous about this, for it might end, you know, said Alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then ? And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 12 DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE. 13 for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once, but, alas for poor Alice ! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. Come, there s no use in crying like that ! said Alice to herself, rather sharply, I advise you to leave off this minute ! She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it,) and sometimes she",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Alice_in_Wonderland,4,"scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes, and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. But it s no use now, thought poor Alice, to pretend to be two people ! Why, there s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person ! Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words EAT ME were beautifully marked in currants. Well, I ll eat it, said Alice, and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door ; so either way I ll get into the garden, and I dont care which happens ! She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself Which way ? Which way ? holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to nd that she remained the same size : to be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE. way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. So she set to work, and very soon nished off the cake. * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II. THE POOL OF TEARS.

Im sure I shan t be able ! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble my- self about you : you must manage the best way you can ;but I must be kind to them, thought Alice, or perhaps they won t walk the way I want to go ! Let me see : I ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas. And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. They must go by the carrier, she thought ; and how funny it ll seem, sending presents to ones own feet ! And how odd the directions will look ! Alices Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender. (with Alices love.) Oh dear, what nonsense I m talking ! Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall : in fact she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice ! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye ; but to get through was more hopeless than ever : she sat down and began to cry again. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, said Alice, a great girl like you, (she might well say this,) to go on crying in this way ! Stop this moment, I tell you ! But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall. After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, Oh ! the Duchess, the Duchess ! Oh ! wont she be savage if I ve kept her waiting ! Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help C",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes

How queer everything is to-day ! And yester- day things went on just as usual. I wonder if I ve been changed in the night ? Let me think : was I the same when I got up this morning ? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I ? Ah, thats the great puzzle ! And she began thinking over all the children she knew, that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them. I m sure I m not Ada, she said, for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all ; and I m sure I can t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh ! she knows such a very little ! Besides, shes she, and Im I, andoh dear, how puzzling it all is ! I ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see : four times ve is twelve, C 2 of any one ; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, If you please, sir The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

I ll try and say How doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap, as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do : How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale ! How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spreads his claws, And welcome little shes in With gently smiling jaws ! I m sure those are not the right words, said poor Alice, and her eyes lled with tears again as she went on, I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh ! ever so many lessons to learn ! No, I ve made up my mind about it : if I m Mabel, I ll stay down here ! It ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying, Come up again, dear ! I shall only look up and say, Who am I then ?

I am so very tired of being all alone here ! As she said this, she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbits little white kid gloves while she was talking. How can I have done that ? she thought.

She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether. That was a narrow escape",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no
Alice_in_Wonderland,6,"! said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to nd herself still in existence ; and now for the garden ! and she ran with all speed back to the little door : but, alas ! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, and things are worse than ever, thought the poor child, for I never was so small as this before, never ! And I declare it s too bad, that it is ! As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash ! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her rst idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, and in that case I can go back by railway, she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general con- clusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. I wish I hadnt cried so much ! said Alice, as she swam about, trying to nd her way out. Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 24 THE POOL OF TEARS. 25 I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears ! That will be a queer thing, to be sure ! However, everything is queer to-day. Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse, that had slipped in like herself. Would it be of any use, now, thought Alice, to speak to this mouse ? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk : at any rate there s no harm in trying. So she began : O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool ? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse ! (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brothers Latin Grammar, A mouse of a mouseto a mousea mouseO mouse !) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. Perhaps it doesnt understand English, thought Alice ; I daresay it s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror. (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again : Ou est ma chatte ? which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. Oh, I beg your pardon ! cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings. I quite forgot you didnt like cats. Not like cats ! cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. Would you like cats if you were me ? Well, perhaps not, said Alice in a sooth- ing tone : dont be angry about it. And yet Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she called softly after it : Mouse dear ! Do come back again, and we wont talk about cats or dogs either, if you dont like them ! When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low, trembling voice, Let us get to the shore, and then I ll tell you my history, and you ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs. It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and ani- mals that had fallen into it : there was a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. C H A P T E R III. A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE. THEY were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bankthe birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and un- comfortable. The rst question of course was, how to get dry again : they had a consultation about this, Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 30 A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE. 31 and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to nd herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, I am older than you, and must know better ; and this Alice would not allow, with- out knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of some authority among them, called out, Sit down, all of you, and listen to me ! Ill soon make you dry enough ! They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously xed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. Ahem ! said the Mouse with an important air, are you all ready ? This is the driest thing Silence all round, if you please ! I know. William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria Ugh ! said the Lory, with a shiver. I beg your pardon ? said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely : Did you speak ? Not I ! said the Lory, hastily. I thought you did, said the Mouse. I proceed. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him ; and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable Found what ? said the Duck. Found it, the Mouse replied rather crossly : of course you know what it means. I know what it means well enough, when I nd a thing, said the Duck : it s generally a frog or a worm. The question",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no

Williams conduct at rst was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans How are you getting on now, my dear ? it con- tinued, turning to Alice as it spoke. As wet as ever, said Alice in a melancholy tone : it doesn t seem to dry me at all. In that case, said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies Speak English ! said the Eaglet. I don t know the meaning of half those long words, and, whats more, I dont believe you do either! And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile : some of the other birds tittered audibly. What I was going to say, said the Dodo in an offended tone, was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race. What is a Caucus-race ? said Alice ; not that she much wanted to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. Why, said the Dodo, the best way to explain it is to do it. (And as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.) First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ( the exact shape doesn t matter, it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no One, two, three, and away, but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half- an-hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, The race is over ! and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, But who has won ? This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its D Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

At last the Dodo said, Everybody has won, and all must have prizes. But who is to give the prizes ? quite a chorus of voices asked. Why, she, of course, said the Dodo, point- ing to Alice with one finger ; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, Prizes ! Prizes ! Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comts, (luckily the salt water had not got into it,) and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round. But she must have a prize herself, you know, said the Mouse. Of course, the Dodo replied very gravely. What else have you got in your pocket ? he went on, turning to Alice. Only a thimble, said Alice sadly. Hand it over here, said the Dodo. Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying, We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble ; and, when it had nished this short speech, they all cheered.

The next thing was to eat the comts : this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.

Mine is a long and a sad tale ! said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing. It is a long tail, certainly, said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouses tail ; but why do you call it sad ? And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this :Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, Let us both go to law : I will prosecute you. Come, I ll take no denial ; We must have a trial : For really this morning I ve nothing to do. Said the mouse to the cur, Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath. I ll be judge, I ll be jury, Said cunning old Fury ; I ll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death. Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved.

I beg your pardon, said Alice very humbly: you had got to the fth bend, I think ? I had not ! cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily. A knot ! said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. Oh, do let me help to undo it ! I shall do nothing of the sort, said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. You insult me by talking such nonsense ! I didn t mean it ! pleaded poor Alice. But you re so easily offended, you know ! The Mouse only growled in reply. Please come back, and nish your story ! Alice called after it ; and the others all joined in chorus, Yes, please do ! but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker. What a pity it wouldn t stay ! sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight ; and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter, Ah, my dear ! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper ! Hold your tongue, Ma ! said the young crab, a little snappishly. You re enough to try the patience of an oyster ! I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do ! said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. She d soon fetch it back ! And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question ? said the Lory. Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet. Dinah s our cat. And she s such a capital one for catching mice you can t think ! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds ! Why, she ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it ! This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.

Its high time you were all in bed ! On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone. I wish I hadn t mentioned Dinah ! she said to herself in a melancholy tone. Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I m sure she s the best cat in the world ! Oh, my dear Dinah ! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more ! And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.

IT was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something ; and she heard it muttering to itself, The Duchess ! The Duchess ! Oh my dear paws ! Oh my fur and whiskers ! She ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets ! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder !

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here ? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan ! Quick, now ! And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake that it had made. He took me for his housemaid, she said to herself as she ran. How surprised he ll be when he nds out who I am ! But I d better take him his fan and glovesthat is, if I can nd them. As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name W. RABBIT, engraved upon it. She went in without knock- ing, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves. How queer it seems, Alice said to herself, to be going messages for a rabbit ! I suppose Dinah ll be sending me on messages next ! And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen : Miss Alice ! Come here di- rectly, and get ready for your walk ! Coming in a minute, nurse ! But I ve got to watch this mousehole till Dinah comes back, and see that the mouse doesn t get out. Only I don t think, Alice went on, that they d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that ! By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves : she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking- glass. There was no label this time with the Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved.

I know something interesting is sure to happen, she said to herself, whenever I eat or drink any- thing ; so I ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it ll make me grow large again, for really I m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing ! It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected : before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself, That s quite enoughI hope I shan t grow any moreAs it is, I can t get out at the doorI do wish I hadn t drunk quite so much ! Alas ! It was too late to wish that ! She went on growing and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor : in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on grow- ing, and, as",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no

It was much pleasanter at home, thought poor Alice, when one wasn t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn t gone down that rabbit-holeand yetand yetit s rather curious, you know, this sort of life ! I do wonder what can have happened to me ! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one ! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought ! And when I grow up, I ll write onebut I m grown up now, she added in a sorrowful tone, at least there s no room to grow up any more here. But then, thought Alice, shall I never get any older than I am now ? That ll be a comfort, one waynever to be an old woman but thenalways to have lessons to learn ! Oh, I shouldn t like that ! Oh, you foolish Alice ! she answered her- self. How can you learn lessons in here ? Why, there s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books ! And so she went on, taking rst one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether, but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen. Mary Ann ! Mary Ann ! said the voice, fetch me my gloves this moment ! Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it, but as the door opened inwards, and Alices elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, Then I ll go round and get in at the window. Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 48 THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL. 49 That you wont ! thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of bro- ken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voicethe Rabbits Pat ! Pat ! Where are you ? And then a voice she had never heard before, Sure then I m here ! Digging for apples, yer honour ! Digging said the Rabbit angrily. Here ! Come and help me for apples, indeed ! out of this ! (Sounds of more broken glass.) Now tell me, Pat, whats that in the window? Sure, its an arm, yer honour ! (He pro- nounced it arrum.) An arm, you goose ! Who ever saw one that size ? Why, it lls the whole window ! Sure, it does, yer honour : but it s an arm for all that. Well, its got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away ! There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, such as, Sure, I dont like it, yer honour, at all, at all ! Do as I tell you, you coward ! and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. What a number of cucumber frames there must be ! thought Alice. I wonder what they ll do next ! As for pulling me out of the window,",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no

Why, I they seem to put everything upon Bill ! wouldn t be in Bills place for a good deal : this replace is narrow, to be sure, but I think I can kick a little ! She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn t guess of what sort it was) scratch- ing and scrambling about in the chimney close above her : then, saying to her- self, This is Bill, she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill ! then the Rabbits voice alone Catch him, you by the hedge ! then E 2 Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

What happened to you ? Tell us all about it ! Last came a little feeble squeaking voice, ( That s Bill, thought Alice,) Well, I hardly knowNo more, thank ye, I m better now but I m a deal too flustered to tell youall I know is, something comes at me like a Jack- in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket ! So you did, old fellow ! said the others. We must burn the house down ! said the Rabbits voice, and Alice called out as loud as she could, If you do, I ll set Dinah at you ! There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, I wonder what they will do next ! If they had any sense, theyd take the roof off. After a minute or two they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, A barrowful will do, to begin with. A barrowful of what ? thought Alice ; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. I ll put a stop to this, she said to herself and shouted out, You d better not do that again ! which produced another dead silence. Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the oor, and a bright idea came into her head. If I eat one of these cakes, she thought, it s sure to make some change in my size ; and as it can t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose. So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.

The rst thing Ive got to do, said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, is to grow to my right size again ; and the second thing is to nd my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan. It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged ; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it ; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry. An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. Poor little thing ! said Alice in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it, but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy ; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 56 THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL. 57 delight, and rushed at the stick, and made be- lieve to worry it ; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over, and, the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it ; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart- horse, and expecting every moment to be tram- pled under its feet, ran round the thistle again ; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hang- ing out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut. This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape, so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance. And yet what a dear little puppy it was ! said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves , I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, ifif Id only been the right size to do it ! Oh dear ! Id nearly forgotten that Ive got to grow up again ! Let me seehow is it to be managed ? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other ; but the great question is, what ? The great question certainly was, what ? Alice looked all round her at the owers and the blades of grass, but she could not see any- thing that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself, and when she had look- ed under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it. She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved.

Alice_in_Wonderland,14,"you ? said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, II hardly know, sir, just at presentat least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then. What do you mean by that ? said the Caterpillar sternly. Explain yourself ! I cant explain myself, Im afraid, sir, said Alice, because Im not myself, you see. I don t see, said the Caterpillar. Im afraid I cant put it more clearly, Alice replied very politely, for I can t under- stand it myself to begin with ; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing. It isn t, said the Caterpillar. Well, perhaps you havent found it so yet, said Alice ; but when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day, you knowand then after that into a buttery, I should think youll feel it a little queer, wont you ? Not a bit, said the Caterpillar. Well, perhaps your feelings may be differ- ent, said Alice ; all I know is, it would feel very queer to me. You ! said the Caterpillar contemptuously. Who are you ? Which brought them back again to the be- ginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillars making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, I think, you ought to tell me who you are, rst. Why ? said the Caterpillar. Here was another puzzling question ; and, as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very un- pleasant state of mind, she turned away. Come back ! the Caterpillar called after her. Ive something important to say ! This sounded promising, certainly : Alice turned and came back again. Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

Is that all ? said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. No, said the Caterpillar. Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speak- ing, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, So you think youre changed, do you ?

Well, Ive tried to say How doth the little busy bee, but it all came different ! Alice replied in a very melancholy voice. Repeat You are old, Father William, said the Caterpillar.

It is wrong from beginning to end, said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes. The Caterpillar was the rst to speak. What size do you want to be ? it asked. Oh, Im not particular as to size, Alice hastily replied ; only one doesnt like changing so often, you know. I dont know, said the Caterpillar. Alice said nothing : she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper. Are you content now ? said the Caterpillar. Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldnt mind, said Alice : three inches is such a wretched height to be. It is a very good height indeed ! said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

And she thought to herself, I wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended ! You ll get used to it in time, said the Caterpillar ; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking as it went, One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter. One side of what ? The other side of what ? thought Alice to herself. Of the mushroom, said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud ; and in another moment it was out of sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it ; and, as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difcult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. And now which is which ? she said to her- self, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect : the next moment she felt a vio- lent blow underneath her chin : it had struck her foot ! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly ; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth ; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

What can all that green stuff be ? said Alice. And where have my shoulders got to ? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can t see you ? She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes
Alice_in_Wonderland,16,"except a little shaking among the distant green leaves. As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to nd that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry : a large pigeon had own into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings. Serpent ! screamed the Pigeon. Im not a serpent ! said Alice indignantly. Let me alone ! Serpent, I say again ! repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, Ive tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them ! I haven t the least idea what you re talk- ing about, said Alice. Ive tried the roots of trees, and Ive tried banks, and Ive tried hedges, the Pigeon went on, without attending to her ; but those serpents ! There s no pleasing them ! Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had nished. As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs, said the Pigeon ; but I must be on Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved.

Im very sorry youve been annoyed, said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning. And just as Id taken the highest tree in the wood, continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ! Ugh! Serpent ! But I m not a serpent, I tell you ! said Alice. I m a I m a Well ! What are you ? said the Pigeon. I can see you re trying to invent something ! II m a little girl, said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day. A likely story indeed ! said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. I ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that ! No, no ! You re a serpent ; and there s no use denying it. I sup- pose you ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg ! I have tasted eggs, certainly, said Alice, who was a very truthful child ; but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know. I dont believe it, said the Pigeon ; but if they do, why then they re a kind of serpent, that s all I can say. This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, You re looking for eggs, I know that well it matter to me enough ; and what does whether you re a little girl or a serpent ? It matters a good deal to me, said Alice hastily ; but I m not looking for eggs, as it happens ; and if I was, I shouldn t want yours : I dont like them raw.

Whoever lives there, thought Alice, it ll never do to come upon them this size : why, I should frighten them out of their wits ! So she began nibbling at the right-hand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes
Alice_in_Wonderland,17,"had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling rst at one and then at the other, and growing some- times taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first, but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself as usual. Come, there s half my plan done now ! How puzzling all these changes are ! I m never sure what I m going to be, from one minute to another ! However, I ve got back to my right size : the next thing is, to get into that beau- tiful gardenhow is that to be done, I won- der ? As she said this, she came suddenly upon Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

FOR a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came run- ning out of the wood(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery : other- wise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a sh)and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and large eyes like a frog ; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the in a solemn tone, For the other, saying Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 78 PIG AND PEPPER. PIG AND PEPPER. 79 croquet. The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, From the Queen. An invi- tation for the Duchess to play croquet. Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together. Alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her, and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked. There s no sort of use in knocking, said the Footman, and that for two reasons. First, because I m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because theyre making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you. And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. Please, then, said Alice, how am I to get in ? There might be some sense in your knock- ing, the Footman went on without attending to her, if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know. He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. But perhaps he cant help it, she said to herself ; his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questionsHow am I to get in ? she repeated, aloud. I shall sit here, the Footman remarked, till to-morrow At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footmans head : it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 80 PIG AND PEPPER. the trees behind him. or next day, maybe, the Footman con- tinued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened. How am I to get in ? asked Alice again in a louder tone. Are you to get in",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes
Alice_in_Wonderland,18,"at all ? said the Foot- man. That s the rst question, you know. It was, no doubt : only Alice did not like to be told so. It s really dreadful, she muttered to herself, the way all the creatures argue. It s enough to drive one crazy ! The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. I shall sit here, he said, on and off, for days and days. But what am I to do ? said Alice. Anything you like, said the Footman, and began whistling. Oh, there s no use in talking to him, said Alice desperately : he s perfectly idiotic ! And she opened the door and went in. PIG AND PEPPER. 81 The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other : the Duchess was sitting on a three- legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby ; the cook was leaning over the re, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup. There s certainly too much pepper in that soup ! Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. G Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 82 PIG AND PEPPER. PIG AND PEPPER. 83 There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally ; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howl- ing alternately without a moments pause. The only two creatures in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. Please, would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak rst, why your cat grins like that ? It s a Cheshire cat, said the Duchess, and that s why. Pig ! She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped ; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again : I didnt know that Cheshire cats always grinned ; in fact, I didnt know that cats could grin. They all can, said the Duchess ; and most of em do. I dont know of any that do, Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. You dont know much, said the Duchess ; and that s a fact. Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to x on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the re, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the babythe fire-irons came first ; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her ; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not. Oh, please mind what you re doing ! cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of G 2 Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved.

Oh, there goes his precious nose ! as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off. If everybody minded their own business, said the Duchess in a hoarse growl, the world would go round a deal faster than it does. Which would not be an advantage, said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. Just think of what work it would make with the day and night ! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis Talking of axes, said the Duchess, chop off her head ! Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint ; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again : Twenty- four hours, I think ; or is it twelve ? I Oh, dont bother me, said the Duchess ; I never could abide gures. And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a vio- lent shake",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes
Alice_in_Wonderland,19,"at the end of every line : Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes ; He only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases. CHORUS (in which the cook and the baby joined) : Wow ! wow ! wow ! While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words : I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes ; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases ! CHORUS Wow ! wow ! wow ! Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 86 PIG AND PEPPER. PIG AND PEPPER. 87 Here ! you may nurse it a bit, if you like ! said the Duchess to Alice, inging the baby at her as she spoke. I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen, and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went, but it just missed her. Alice caught the baby with some difculty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, just like a star-sh, thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the rst minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it. As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. If I dont take this child away with me, thought Alice, they re sure to kill it in a day or two : wouldnt it be murder to leave it behind ? She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). Dont grunt, said Alice : that s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself. The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose ; also its eyes were getting extremely small, for a baby : altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all, but perhaps it was only sobbing, she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears. No, there were no tears. If you re going to turn into a pig, my dear, said Alice, seriously, I ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now ! The poor little thing sobbed again, (or grunted, it was impossible to say which,) and they went on for some while in silence. Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 88 PIG AND PEPPER. PIG AND PEPPER. 89 Alice was just beginning to think to herself, Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home ? when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be no mistake about it : it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt it would be that quite absurd for her to carry it any fur- ther. So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. If it had grown up, she said to herself, it would have made a dreadfully ugly child : but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think. And she be- gan thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just say- ing to herself, if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked goodnatured, she thought : still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt it ought to be treated with respect. Cheshire Puss, she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name : however, it",no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
Alice_in_Wonderland,20,"only grinned a little wider. Come, it s pleased so far, thought Alice, and she went on, Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to walk from here ? That depends a good deal on where you want to get to, said the Cat. I don t much care where said Alice. Then it doesnt matter which way you walk, said the Cat. so long as I get somewhere, Alice added as an explanation. Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

PIG AND PEPPER. 91 Oh, you re sure to do that, said the Cat, if you only walk long enough. Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. What sort of people live about here ? In that direction, the Cat said, waving its right paw round, lives a Hatter : and in that direction, waving the other paw, lives a March Hare. Visit either you like : they re both mad. But I dont want to go among mad people, Alice remarked. Oh, you can t help that, said the Cat : we re all mad here. I m mad. You re mad. How do you know I m mad ? said Alice. You must be, said the Cat, or you wouldnt have come here. Alice didn t think that proved it at all ; however, she went on: And how do you know that you re mad ? To begin with, said the Cat, a dog s not mad. You grant that ? I suppose so, said Alice. Well, then, the Cat went on, you see a dog growls when it s angry, and wags its tail when it s pleased. Now I growl when I m pleased, and wag my tail when Im angry. There- fore I m mad. I call it purring, not growling, said Alice. Call it what you like, said the Cat.

Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things hap- pening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. By-the-bye, what became of the baby ? said the Cat. I d nearly forgotten to ask. It turned into a pig, Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way. I thought it would, said the Cat, and vanished again. Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. I ve seen hatters before, she said to herself : the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it wont be raving mad at least not so mad as it was in March. As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. Did you say pig, or g ? said the Cat. I said pig, replied Alice ; and I wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so sud- denly : you make one quite giddy. All right, said the Cat ; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which re- mained some time after the rest of it had gone. Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 94 PIG AND PEPPER. Well ! I ve often seen a cat without a grin, thought Alice ; but a grin without a cat ! It s the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life ! She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare : she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mush- room, and raised herself to about two feet high : even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself, Suppose it should be raving",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes

THERE was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it : a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse, thought Alice; only, as it s asleep, I suppose it doesn t mind. The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it : No room ! No room ! they cried out when they saw Alice coming. There s plenty of Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved.

Have some wine, the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. I don t see any wine, she remarked. There isn t any, said the March Hare. Then it wasn t very civil of you to offer it, said Alice angrily. It wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited, said the March Hare. I didn t know it was your table, said Alice ; it s laid for a great many more than three. Your hair wants cutting, said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech. You should learn not to make personal remarks, Alice said with some severity : it s very rude. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this ; but all he said was, Why is a raven like a writing-desk ? Come, we shall have some fun now ! thought Alice. I m glad they ve begun ask- ing riddlesI believe I can guess that, she added aloud. Do you mean that you think you can nd out the answer to it ? said the March Hare. Exactly so, said Alice. Then you should say what you mean, the H Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved.

I do, Alice hastily replied ; at leastat least I mean what I saythat s the same thing, you know. Not the same thing a bit ! said the Hatter. Why, you might just as well say that I see what I eat is the same thing as I eat what I see ! You might just as well say, added the March Hare, that I like what I get is the same thing as I get what I like ! You might just as well say, added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, that I breathe when I sleep is the same thing as I sleep when I breathe ! It is the same thing with you, said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn t much. The Hatter was the rst to break the silence. What day of the month is it ? he said, turn- ing to Alice : he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shak- ing it every now and then, and holding it to his ear. Alice considered a little, and said, The fourth. Two days wrong ! sighed the Hatter. I told you butter wouldn t suit the works ! he added, looking angrily at the March Hare. It was the best butter, the March Hare meekly replied. Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well, the Hatter grumbled : you shouldn t have put it in with the bread-knife. The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily : then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again : but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, It was the best butter, you know. Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. What a funny watch ! she remarked. It tells the day of the month, and H 2 Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

Does your watch tell you what year it is ? Of course not, Alice replied very readily : but that s because it stays the same year for such a long time together. Which is just the case with mine, said the Hatter. Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatters remark seemed to her to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. I don t quite understand you, she said, as politely as she could. The Dormouse is asleep again, said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea on to its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, Of course, of course : just what I was going to remark myself. Have you guessed the riddle yet ? the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. A MAD TEA-PARTY. 101 No, I give it up, Alice replied : what s the answer ? I haven t the slightest idea, said the Hatter. Nor I, said the March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. I think you might do something better with the time, she said, than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers. If you knew Time as well as I do, said the Hatter, you wouldnt talk about wasting it. It s him. I dont know what you mean, said Alice. Of course you dont ! the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. I dare say you never even spoke to Time !

Half-past one, time for dinner ! ( I only wish it was, the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.) That would be grand, certainly, said Alice thoughtfully : but thenI shouldnt be hungry for it, you know. Not at rst, perhaps, said the Hatter : but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked. Is that the way you manage ? Alice asked. The Hatter shook his head mournfully. Not I ! he replied. We quarrelled last March just before he went mad, you know (point- ing with his teaspoon at the March Hare,) it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing Twinkle, twinkle, little bat !

Well, I d hardly finished the first verse, said the Hatter, when the Queen bawled out He s murdering the time ! Off with his head ! How dreadfully savage ! exclaimed Alice. And ever since that, the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, he wont do a thing I ask ! It s always six oclock now. A bright idea came into Alices head. Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here ? she asked. Yes, that s it, said the Hatter with a sigh : it s always tea-time, and we ve no time to wash the things between whiles. Then you keep moving round, I suppose ? said Alice. Exactly so, said the Hatter : as the things get used up. again ? Alice ventured to ask. Suppose we change the subject, the March Hare interrupted, yawning. I m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story. I m afraid I dont know one, said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal. Then the Dormouse shall ! they both",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes

I wasnt asleep, he said in a hoarse, feeble voice : I heard every word you fellows were saying. Tell us a story ! said the March Hare. Yes, please do ! pleaded Alice. And be quick about it, added the Hatter, or you ll be asleep again before it s done. Once upon a time there were three little sisters, the Dormouse began in a great hurry ; and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie ; and they lived at the bottom of a well But when you come to the beginning What did they live on ? said Alice, who Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

They couldnt have done that, you know, Alice gently remarked ; they d have been ill. So they were, said the Dormouse; very ill. Alice tried a little to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on : But why did they live at the bottom of a well ? Take some more tea, the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. I ve had nothing yet, Alice replied in an offended tone, so I cant take more. You mean, you cant take less, said the Hatter : it s very easy to take more than no- thing. Nobody asked your opinion, said Alice. Who s making personal remarks now ? the Hatter asked triumphantly. Alice did not quite know what to say to this : so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dor- mouse, and repeated her question. Why did they live at the bottom of a well ? The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, It was a treacle-well. There s no such thing ! Alice was begin- ning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went Sh ! sh ! and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, If you cant be civil, you d better nish the story for yourself. No, please go on ! Alice said very hum- bly : I wont interrupt again. I dare say there may be one. One, indeed ! said the Dormouse indig- nantly. However, he consented to go on. And so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw, you know What did they draw ? said Alice, quite forgetting her promise. Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

I want a clean cup, interrupted the Hatter: let s all move one place on. He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him : the March Hare moved into the Dormouses place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change : and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just up- set the milk-jug into his plate. Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously : But I dont understand. Where did they draw the treacle from ? You can draw water out of a water-well, said the Hatter ; so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-welleh, stupid ? But they were in the well, Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark. well in. This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it. They were learning to draw, the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy ; and they drew all manner of thingseverything that begins with an M Why with an M ? said Alice. Why not ? said the March Hare. Alice was silent. The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze, but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on : that begins with an M, such as mousetraps, and the moon, and memory, and muchnessyou know you say things are much of a",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear : she got up in great disgust, and walked off : the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her : the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot. At any rate I ll never go there again ! said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. It s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life ! Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. That s very curious ! she thought. But everythings curious to-day. I think I may as well go in at once. And in she went. Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. Now, I ll manage better this time, she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high : then she walked down the little passage : and thenshe found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright owerbeds and the cool fountains.

Youd better not talk ! said Five. I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded ! C H A P T E R VIII. THE QUEENS CROQUET-GROUND. A LARGE rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden : the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, Look out now, Five ! Dont go splashing paint over me like that ! I couldnt help it, said Five in a sulky tone ; Seven jogged my elbow. On which Seven looked up and said, That s right, Five ! Always lay the blame on others !

Seven Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet I Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 114 THE QUEENS CROQUET-GROUND. 115 Would you tell me please, said Alice, a little timidly, why you are painting those roses ? Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake, and if the Queen was to nd it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we re doing our best, afore she comes, to At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out The Queen ! The Queen ! and the three gardeners instantly threw them- selves at upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs ; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and at, with their hands and feet at the cor- ners: next the ten courtiers ; these were orna- mented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children ; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples : they were",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes

Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit : it was talk- ing in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion ; and, last of all this grand pro- cession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions ; and besides, what would be the use of a procession, she thought, if people had all to lie down on their faces, so that they couldnt see it ? So she stood where she was, and waited. I 2 Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 116 THE QUEENS CROQUET-GROUND. 117 When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely, Who is this ? She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. Idiot ! said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently ; and, turning to Alice, she went on, What s your name, child ? My name is Alice, so please your Majesty, said Alice very politely ; but she added, to herself, Why, they re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn t be afraid of them ! And who are these ? said the Queen, point- ing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree ; for you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. How should I know ? said Alice, surprised at her own courage. It s no business of mine. The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, began screaming, Off with her head ! Off Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 118 THE QUEENS CROQUET-GROUND. 119 Nonsense ! said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent. The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said, Consider, my dear : she is only a child ! The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave, Turn them over ! The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. Get up ! said the Queen in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else. Leave off that ! screamed the Queen. You make me giddy. And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, What have you been doing here ? May it please your Majesty, said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, we were trying I see ! said the Queen, who had mean- while been examining the roses. Off with their heads ! and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection. You shant be beheaded ! said Alice, and she put them into a large ower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. Are their heads off ? shouted the Queen. Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty ! the soldiers shouted in reply. That s right ! shouted the Queen. Can you play croquet ? The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her. Yes ! shouted Alice. Come on then ! roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next. It sit s a very fine day ! said a timid voice at her side.

Hush ! said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes
Alice_in_Wonderland,26,"whispered, She s under sentence of execution. What for ? said Alice. Did you say What a pity ! ? the Rabbit asked. No, I didnt, said Alice : I dont think it s at all a pity. I said What for ? She boxed the Queens ears the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. Oh, hush ! the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. The Queen will hear you ! You see she came rather late, and the Queen said Get to your places ! shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other : however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life : it was all ridges and furrows ; the croquet-balls were live live flamingoes, and hedgehogs, the mallets the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. The chief diffi- culty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo : she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up into her face, with such a puzzled expres- Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 122 THE QUEENS CROQUET-GROUND. 123 sion that she could not help bursting out laugh- ing : and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difcult game indeed. The players all played at once without wait- ing for turns, quarrelling all the while, and ghting for the hedgehogs ; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting, Off with his head ! or Off with her head ! about once in a minute. Alice began to feel very uneasy : to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, and then, thought she, what would become of me ? They re dreadfully fond of beheading people here : the great wonder is, that there s any one left alive ! She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air : it puzzled her very much at first, but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself, It s the Cheshire Cat : now I shall have somebody to talk to. How are you getting on ? said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with. Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. It s no use speaking to it, she thought, till its ears have come, or at least In another minute the whole one of them. head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had some one to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 124 THE QUEENS CROQUET-GROUND. 125 enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared. I dont think they play at all fairly, Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear ones-self speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular ; at least, if there are, nobody attends to themand you ve no idea how con- fusing it is all the things being alive ; for in- stance, there s the arch I ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundand I should have croqueted the Queens hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming !

Not at all, said Alice : she s so ex- tremely Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening : so she went on likely to win, that it s hardly worth while nishing the game. The Queen smiled and passed on. Who are you talking to ? said the King, coming up to Alice, and looking at the Cats head with great curiosity. Its a friend of minea Cheshire Cat, said Alice : allow me to introduce it. I don t like the look of it at all, said the King : however, it may kiss my hand if it likes. I d rather not, the Cat remarked. Don t be impertinent, said the King, and don t look at me like that ! He got behind Alice as he spoke. A cat may look at a king, said Alice. I ve read that in some book, but I don t re- member where. Well, it must be removed, said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, My dear ! I wish you would have this cat removed ! The Queen had only one way of settling all difculties, great or small. Off with his head ! she said without even looking round. Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved. Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 126 THE QUEENS CROQUET-GROUND. 127 I ll fetch the executioner myself, said the King eagerly, and he hurried off. Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queens voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sen- tence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went off in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a ght with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other : the only difficulty was, that her amingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to y up into a tree. By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight : but it doesnt matter much, thought Alice, as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground. So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back to have a little more conversation with her friend. When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to nd quite a large crowd col- lected round it : there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable. The moment Alice appeared, she was ap- pealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard to make out exactly what they said. The executioners argument was, that you couldn t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from : that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn t going to begin at his time of life.

Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the Duchess : you d better ask her about it. She s in prison, the Queen said to the executioner : fetch her here. And the execu- tioner went off like an arrow. The Cats head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared : so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game. The Kings argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren t to talk nonsense. The Queens argument was, that if some- thing wasn t done about it in less than no time, (It she",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes

However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could. The game s going on rather better now, she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. Tis so, said the Duchess : and the moral of that is Oh, tis love, tis love, that makes the world go round ! Somebody said, Alice whispered, that its done by everybody minding their own business ! Ah well ! It means much the same thing, said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alices shoulder as she added, and the moral of that is Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves. How fond she is of finding morals in things ! Alice thought to herself. I daresay you re wondering why I don t put my arm round your waist, said the Duchess after a pause: the reason is, that Im doubt- ful about the temper of your amingo. Shall I try the experiment ? He might bite, Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experi- ment tried. Very true, said the Duchess : amingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is Birds of a feather ock together. Only mustard isn t a bird, Alice remarked. Right, as usual, said the Duchess : what a clear way you have of putting things !

Now, I give you fair warning, shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke ; either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time ! Take your choice ! The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. Let s go on with the game, the Queen said to Alice, and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. The other guests had taken advantage of the Queens absence, and were resting in the shade : however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their lives. All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting Off with his head ! or Off with her head ! Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody, and under sentence of execution. Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet ? No, said Alice. I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is. It s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from, said the Queen. I never saw one, or heard of one, said Alice. Come on, then, said the Queen, and he shall tell you his history.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes : then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight : then it chuckled. What fun ! said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice. What is the fun ? said Alice. Why, she, said the Gryphon. It s all her fancy, that : they never executes nobody, you know. Come on ! Everybody says come on ! here, thought Alice, as she went slowly after it : I never was so ordered about before in all my life, never ! They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. What is his sorrow ? she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, It s all his fancy, that : he hasnt got no sorrow, you know.

This here young lady, said the Gryphon, she wants for to know your history, she do. I ll tell it her, said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone : sit down, both of you, and don t speak a word till I ve nished. So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, I don t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn t begin. But she waited patiently. Once, said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, I was a real Turtle. These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclama- tion of Hjckrrh ! from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, Thank you, sir, for your interesting story, but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing. When we were little, the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sob- bing a little now and then, we went to school in the sea.

Alice asked. We called him Tortoise because he taught us, said the Mock Turtle angrily ; really you are very dull ! You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question, added the Gry- phon ; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, Drive on, old fellow ! Dont be all day about it ! and he went on in these words. With extras ? asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously. Yes, said Alice, we learned French and music. And washing ? said the Mock Turtle. Certainly not ! said Alice indignantly. Ah ! Then yours wasn t a really good school, said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief, now at ours they had at the end of the bill, French, music, and washingextra. You couldn t have wanted it much, said Yes, we went to school in the sea, though Alice ; living at the bottom of the sea. you mayn t believe it I never said I didn t ! interrupted Alice.

We had the best of educationsin fact, we went to school every day I couldn t afford to learn it, said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. I only took the regular course. What was that ? enquired Alice.

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in sur- prise. Never heard of uglifying ! it exclaimed. You know what to beautify is, I suppose ? Yes, said Alice, doubtfully : it means tomakeanythingprettier. Well then, the Gryphon went on, if you is, you are a don t know what to uglify simpleton. Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said What else had you to learn ? Well, there was Mystery, the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his appers, Mystery, ancient and modern,",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes

What was that like ? said Alice. Well, I can t show it you myself, the Mock Turtle said : I m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it. Hadn t time, said the Gryphon : I went to the Classical master, though. He was an old crab, he was. I never went to him, the Mock Turtle said with a sigh : he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say. So he did, so he did, said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn, and both creatures hid their faces in their paws. And how many hours a day did you do lessons ? said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject. Ten hours the first day, said the Mock Turtle : nine the next, and so on. What a curious plan ! exclaimed Alice. That s the reason they re called lessons, the Gryphon remarked : because they lessen from day to day. This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she L Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved.

Of course it was, said the Mock Turtle. And how did you manage on the twelfth ? Alice went on eagerly. That s enough about lessons, the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone : tell her something about the games now. C H A P T E R X. THE LOBSTER QUADRILLE. THE Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. Same as if he had a bone in his throat, said the Gryphon, and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again : You may not have lived much under the sea ( I haven t, said Alice) and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster L 2 Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

No, indeed, said Alice. What sort of a dance is it ? The lobsters ! shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air. as far out to sea as you can Swim after them ! screamed the Gryphon.

Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance. Oh, you sing, said the Gryphon. I ve forgotten the words. So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their fore-paws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly : Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

Thank you, it s a very interesting dance to watch, said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last ; and I do so like that curious song about the whiting ! Oh, as to the whiting, said the Mock Turtle, theyyou ve seen them, of course ? Yes, said Alice, I ve often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily. I don t know where Dinn may be, said the Mock Turtle, but if you ve seen them so often, of course you know what they re like. I believe so, Alice replied thoughtfully. They have their tails in their mouths ;and they re all over crumbs. You re wrong about the crumbs, said the Mock Turtle : crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths ; and the reason is here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes. Tell her about the reason and all that, he said to the Gryphon. The reason is, said the Gryphon, that they would go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn t get them out again. That s all. Thank you, said Alice, its very interest- ing. I never knew so much about a whiting before. I can tell you more than that, if you like, said the Gryphon. Do you know why it s called a whiting ? I never thought about it, said Alice. Why ? Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 154 THE LOBSTER QUADRILLE. 155 It does the boots and shoes, the Gryphon we don t want you with us ! replied very solemnly. Alice was thoroughly puzzled. Does the boots and shoes ! she repeated in a wonder- ing tone. Why, what are your shoes done with ? said the Gryphon. I mean, what makes them so shiny ? Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. They re done with blacking, I believe. Boots and shoes under the sea, the Gry- phon went on in a deep voice, are done with whiting. Now you know. And what are they made of ? Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. Soles and eels, of course, the Gryphon replied rather impatiently : any shrimp could have told you that. If I d been the whiting, said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, I d have said to the porpoise, Keep back, please : They were obliged to have him with them, the Mock Turtle said : no wise sh would go anywhere without a porpoise. Wouldn t it really ? said Alice in a tone of great surprise. Of course not, said the Mock Turtle : why, if a fish came to me, and told me he was going a journey, I should say With what porpoise ? Don t you mean purpose ? said Alice. I mean what I say, the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added Come, let s hear some of your adventures.",no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes

Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 156 THE LOBSTER QUADRILLE. 157 So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit : she was a little nervous about it just at rst, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating You are old, Father William, to the Cater- pillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said, That s very curious. It s all about as curious as it can be, said the Gryphon. It all came different ! the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin. He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice. Stand up and repeat Tis the voice of the sluggard, said the Gryphon. How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat les- sons ! thought Alice, I might just as well be at school at once. However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lob- ster-Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed : Tis the voice of the lobster ; I heard him declare, You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair. As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes. That s different from what I used to say when I was a child, said the Gryphon.

Control Internet Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book 158 THE LOBSTER QUADRILLE. 159 Well, I never heard it before, said the Mock Turtle ; but it sounds uncommon nonsense. Alice said nothing : she had sat down again with her face in her hands, wondering if any- thing would ever happen in a natural way again. I should like to have it explained, said the Mock Turtle. She can t explain it, said the Gryphon hastily. Go on with the next verse. But about his toes ? the Mock Turtle How could he turn them out with persisted. his nose, you know ? It s the first position in dancing, Alice said ; but she was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject. Go on with the next verse, the Gryphon repeated impatiently : it begins I passed by his garden. Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice : I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, How the owl and the oyster were sharing a pie What is the use of repeating all that stuff, the Mock Turtle interrupted, if you dont explain it as you go on ? It s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard ! Yes, I think you d better leave off, said the Gryphon, and Alice was only too glad to do so. Shall we try another gure of the Lobster- Quadrille ? the Gryphon went on. Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song ? Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind, Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, Hm ! No accounting for tastes ! Sing her Turtle Soup, will you, old fellow ? The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this : Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp.

But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time. Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to nd that she knew the name of nearly everything there. That s the judge, she said to herself, because of his great wig. The judge, by the way, was the King, and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming. And that s the jury-box, thought Alice, and those twelve creatures, (she was obliged to say creatures, you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) I M 2 C H A P T E R XI. WHO STOLE THE TARTS ? THE King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards : the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him ; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of Navigate Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. 2000 All Rights Reserved.

She said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it : for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, jury- men would have done just as well. The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. What are they doing ? Alice whispered to the Gryphon. They cant have anything to put down yet, before the trial s begun. Stupid things ! Alice began They re putting down their names, the Gryphon whispered in reply, for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial. loud indignant voice, but she stopped herself hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, Silence in the court ! and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking. in a Alice could see, as well as if she were look- ing over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down stupid things ! on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell stupid, and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. A nice muddle their slates ll be in before the trial s over ! thought Alice. One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it ; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day ; and this was of very little use, as",no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no

There s a great deal to come before that ! Call the rst witness, said the King ; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, First witness ! The rst witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand, and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. I beg pardon, your Majesty, he began, for bringing these in : but I hadnt quite finished my tea when I was sent for. You ought to have nished, said the King. When did you begin ? The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. Fourteenth of March, I think it was, he said. Fifteenth, said the March Hare. Sixteenth, added the Dormouse. Write that down, the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day : The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away !

Take off your hat, the King said to the Hatter. It isnt mine, said the Hatter. Stolen ! the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. I keep them to sell, the Hatter added as an explanation : I ve none of my own. I m a hatter. Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and dgeted. Give your evidence, said the King ; and dont be nervous, or Ill have you executed on the spot. This did not seem to encourage the witness at all : he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was : she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at rst she would get up and leave the court ; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her. I wish you wouldnt squeeze so, said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. I can hardly breathe. I cant help it, said Alice very meekly : I m growing. You ve no right to grow here, said the Dormouse. Dont talk nonsense, said Alice more boldly: you know you re growing too. Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace, said the Dormouse : not in that ridiculous fashion. And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.

They had a large canvass bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings : into this they slipped the guinea- pig, head rst, and then sat upon it.) I m glad I ve seen that done, thought Alice.

She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once. Give your evidence, said the King. Shan t, said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness. Well, if I must, I must, the King said with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, What are tarts made of ? Pepper, mostly, said the cook. Treacle, said a sleepy voice behind her. Collar that Dormouse! the Queen shrieked out. Behead that Dormouse ! Turn that Dor- mouse out of court ! Suppress him ! Pinch him ! Off with his whiskers ! For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. Never mind ! said the King, with an air of great relief. Call the next witness. And he added in an undertone to the Queen, Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache !

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right ; not that it signies much, she said to herself ; I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other. As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gaz- ing up into the roof of the court.

Hearken! and observe how healthily not destroyed how calmly I can tell you the whole story. It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and so by degrees thus rid myself of the eye for ever. very gradually me with what caution .

It took me an hour to place my whole head within the would a madman have opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern I undid it just so cautiously much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights but I found the eye always closed; and so it was every night just at midnight impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept. cautiously (for the hinges creaked) oh, so cautiously Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door.

To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness (for the drew back shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers), and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped Whos upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in the bed, crying out there? I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. oh, no! Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was it was the low stifled sound that",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them It is nothing but the wind in causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself it is only a mouse crossing the floor, or it is merely a cricket which has the chimney made a single chirp. Yes, he has been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions; because Death, in approaching him, had stalked but he had found all in vain. with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful although he neither saw influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel the presence of my head within the room. nor heard Allinvain; When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I you until, at length, a single dim ray, like the resolved to open a little cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and full upon the vulture eye. a very, very little crevice in the lantern.

I knew sound well too. It was the beating of the old mans heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage. that 2 must But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old mans terror have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And every moment! now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must the sound would be heard by a neighbor! burst.

He shrieked once pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more. If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs. his I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings.

Scott Fitzgerald I II III IV IV VI VII VIII IX X XI I JOHN T. UNGER came from a family that had been well known in Hades(cid:20)a small town on the Mississippi River(cid:20)for several generations. John's father had held the amateur golf championship through many a heated contest; Mrs. Unger was known ""from hotbox to hotbed,"" as the local phrase went, for her political addresses; and young John T. Unger, who had just turned sixteen, had danced all the latest dances from New York before he put on long trousers. And now, for a certain time, he was to be away from home. That respect for a New England education which is the bane of all provincial places, which drains them yearly of their most promising young men, had seized upon his parents. Nothing would suit them but that he should go to St. Midas' School near Boston(cid:20) Hades was too small to hold their darling and gifted son. Now in Hades(cid:20)as you know if you ever have been there(cid:20)the names of the more fashionable preparatory schools and colleges mean very little. The inhabitants have been so long out of the world that, though they make a show of keeping up to date in dress and manners and literature, they depend to a great extent on hearsay, and a function that in Hades would be considered elaborate would doubtless be hailed by a Chicago beefprincess as ""perhaps a little tacky."" John T. Unger was on the eve of departure. Mrs. Unger, with maternal fatuity, packed his trunks full of linen suits and electric fans, and Mr. Unger presented his son with an asbestos pocketbook stuffed with money. ""Remember, you are always welcome here,"" he said. ""You can be sure boy, that we'll keep the home fires burning."" ""I know,"" answered John huskily. ""Don't forget who you are and where you come from,"" continued his father proudly, ""and you can do nothing to harm you. You are an Unger(cid:20)from Hades."" So the old man and the young shook hands and John walked away with tears streaming from his eyes. Ten minutes later he had passed outside the city limits, and he stopped to glance back for the last time. Over the gates the oldfashioned Victorian motto seemed strangely attractive to him. His father had tried time and time again to The Diamond as Big as the Ritz 1 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz have it changed to something with a little more push and verve about it, such as ""Hades(cid:20)Your Opportunity,"" or else a plain ""Welcome"" sign set over a hearty handshake pricked out in electric lights. The old motto was a little depressing, Mr. Unger had thought(cid:20)but now.... So John took his look and then set his face resolutely toward his destination. And, as he turned away, the lights of Hades against the sky seemed full of a warm and passionate beauty. St. Midas' School is half an hour from Boston in a RollsPierce motorcar. The actual distance will never be known, for no one, except John T. Unger, had ever arrived there save in a RollsPierce and probably no one ever will again. St. Midas' is the most expensive and the most exclusive boys' preparatory school in the world. John's first two years there passed pleasantly. The fathers of all the boys were moneykings and John spent his summers visiting at fashionable resorts. While he was very fond of all the boys he visited, their fathers struck him as being much of a piece, and in his boyish way he often wondered at their exceeding sameness. When he told them where his home was they would ask jovially, ""Pretty hot down there?"" and John would muster a faint smile and answer, ""It certainly is."" His response would have been heartier had they not all made this joke(cid:20)at best varying it with, ""Is it hot enough for you down there?"" which he hated just as much. In the middle of his second year at school, a quiet, handsome boy named Percy Washington had been put in John's form. The newcomer was pleasant in his manner and exceedingly well dressed even for St. Midas', but for some reason he kept aloof from the other boys. The only person with whom he was intimate was John T. Unger, but even to John he was entirely uncommunicative concerning his home or his family. That he was wealthy went without saying, but beyond a few such deductions John knew little",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

He accepted, without hesitation. It was only when they were in the train that Percy became, for the first time, rather communicative. One day while they were eating lunch in the diningcar and discussing the imperfect characters of several of the boys at school, Percy suddenly changed his tone and made an abrupt remark. ""My father,"" he said, ""is by far the richest man in the world."" ""Oh,"" said John, politely. He could think of no answer to make to this confidence. He considered ""That's very nice,"" but it sounded hollow and was on the point of saying, ""Really?"" but refrained since it would seem to question Percy's statement. And such an astounding statement could scarcely be questioned. ""By far the richest,"" repeated Percy. ""I was reading in the World Almanac,"" began John, ""that there was one man in America with an income of over five million a year and four men with incomes of over three million a year, and(cid:20)"" ""Oh, they're nothing."" Percy's mouth was a halfmoon of scorn. ""Catchpenny capitalists, financial smallfry, petty merchants and moneylenders. My father could buy them out and not know he'd done it."" ""But how does he(cid:20)"" ""Why haven't they put down his income tax? Because he doesn't pay any. At least he pays a little one(cid:20)but he doesn't pay any on his real income."" ""He must be very rich,"" said John simply. ""I'm glad. I like very rich people. The Diamond as Big as the Ritz 2 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz ""The richer a fella is, the better I like him."" There was a look of passionate frankness upon his dark face. ""I visited the SchnlitzerMurphys last Easter. Vivian SchnlitzerMurphy had rubies as big as hen's eggs, and sapphires that were like globes with lights inside them(cid:20)"" ""I love jewels,"" agreed Percy enthusiastically. ""Of course I wouldn't want any one at school to know about it, but I've got quite a collection myself I used to collect them instead of stamps."" ""And diamonds,"" continued John eagerly. ""The SchnlitzerMurphys had diamonds as big as walnuts(cid:20)"" ""That's nothing."" Percy had leaned forward and dropped his voice to a low whisper. ""That's nothing at all. My father has a diamond bigger than the RitzCarlton Hotel."" II THE MONTANA sunset lay between two mountains like a gigantic bruise from which dark arteries spread themselves over a poisoned sky. An immense distance under the sky crouched the village of Fish, minute, dismal, and forgotten. There were twelve men, so it was said, in the village of Fish, twelve somber and inexplicable souls who sucked a lean milk from the almost literally bare rock upon which a mysterious populatory force had begotten them. They had become a race apart, these twelve men of Fish, like some species developed by an early whim of nature, which on second thought had abandoned them to struggle and extermination. Out of the blueblack bruise in the distance crept a long line of moving lights upon the desolation of the land, and the twelve men of Fish gathered like ghosts at the shanty depot to watch the passing of the seven o'clock train, the Transcontinental Express from Chicago. Six times or so a year the Transcontinental Express, through some inconceivable jurisdiction, stopped at the village of Fish, and when this occurred a figure or so would disembark, mount into a buggy that always appeared from out of the dusk, and drive off toward the bruised sunset. The observation of this pointless and preposterous phenomenon had become a sort of cult among the men of Fish. To observe, that was all; there remained in them none of the vital quality of illusion which would make them wonder or speculate, else a religion might have grown up around these mysterious visitations. But the men of Fish were beyond all religion(cid:20)the barest and most savage tenets of even Christianity could gain no foothold on that barren rock(cid:20)so there was no altar, no priest, no sacrifice; only each night at seven the silent concourse by the shanty depot, a congregation who lifted up a prayer of dim, anaemic wonder. On this June night, the Great Brakeman, whom, had they deified any one, they might well have chosen as their celestial protagonist, had ordained that the seven o'clock train should leave its human (or inhuman) deposit at Fish. At two minutes after seven Percy Washington and John T. Unger disembarked, hurried past the spellbound, the agape, the fearsome eyes of the twelve men of Fish, mounted into a buggy which had obviously appeared from nowhere, and drove away. After half an hour, when the twilight had coagulated into dark,",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),2,"the silent negro who was driving the buggy hailed an opaque body somewhere ahead of them in the gloom. In response to his cry, it turned upon them a luminous disk which regarded them like a malignant eye out of the unfathomable night. As they came closer, John saw that it was the taillight of an immense automobile, larger and more magnificent than any he had ever seen. Its body was of gleaming metal richer than nickel and lighter than silver, and the hubs of the wheels were studded with iridescent geometric figures of green and yellow(cid:20)John did not dare to guess whether they were glass or jewel. Two negroes, dressed in glittering livery such as one sees in pictures of royal processions in London, were standing at attention beside the car and as the two young men dismounted from the buggy they were greeted in some language which the guest could not understand, but which seemed to be an extreme form of the Southern negro's dialect. II 3 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz ""Get in,"" said Percy to his friend, as their trunks were tossed to the ebony roof of the limousine. ""Sorry we had to bring you this far in that buggy, but of course it wouldn't do for the people on the train or those Godforsaken fellas in Fish to see this automobile."" ""Gosh! What a car!"" This ejaculation was provoked by its interior. John saw that the upholstery consisted of a thousand minute and exquisite tapestries of silk, woven with jewels and embroideries, and set upon a background of cloth of gold. The two armchair seats in which the boys luxuriated were covered with stuff that resembled duvetyn, but seemed woven in numberless colors of the ends of ostrich feathers. ""What a car!"" cried John again, in amazement. ""This thing?"" Percy laughed. ""Why, it's just an old junk we use for a station wagon."" By this time they were gliding along through the darkness toward the break between the two mountains. ""We'll be there in an hour and a half,"" said Percy, looking at the clock. ""I may as well tell you it's not going to be like anything you ever saw before."" If the car was any indication of what John would see, he was prepared to be astonished indeed. The simple piety prevalent in Hades has the earnest worship of and respect for riches as the first article of its creed(cid:20)had John felt otherwise than radiantly humble before them, his parents would have turned away in horror at the blasphemy. They had now reached and were entering the break between the two mountains and almost immediately the way became much rougher. ""If the moon shone down here, you'd see that we're in a big gulch,"" said Percy, trying to peer out of the window. He spoke a few words into the mouthpiece and immediately the footman turned on a searchlight and swept the hillsides with an immense beam. ""Rocky, you see. An ordinary car would be knocked to pieces in half an hour. In fact, it'd take a tank to navigate it unless you knew the way. You notice we're going uphill now."" They were obviously ascending, and within a few minutes the car was crossing a high rise, where they caught a glimpse of a pale moon newly risen in the distance. The car stopped suddenly and several figures took shape out of the dark beside it(cid:20)these were negroes also. Again the two young men were saluted in the same dimly recognizable dialect; then the negroes set to work and four immense cables dangling from overhead were attached with hooks to the hubs of the great jeweled wheels. At a resounding ""Heyyah!"" John felt the car being lifted slowly from the ground(cid:20) up and up(cid:20)clear of the tallest rocks on both sides(cid:20)then higher, until he could see a wavy, moonlit valley stretched out before him in sharp contrast to the quagmire of rocks that they had just left. Only on one side was there still rock(cid:20)and then suddenly there was no rock beside them or anywhere around. It was apparent that they had surmounted some immense knifeblade of stone, projecting perpendicularly into the air. In a moment they were going down again, and finally with a soft bump they were landed upon the smooth earth. ""The worst is over,"" said Percy, squinting out the window. ""It's only five miles from here, and our own road(cid:20)tapestry brick(cid:20)all the way. This belongs to us. This is where the United States ends, father says."" ""Are we in Canada?"" II 4 ""We are not. We're in the middle of the Montana Rockies. But you are now on the only five square miles of land in the country that's never been surveyed."" The Diamond as Big",no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),3,"as the Ritz ""Why hasn't it? Did they forget it?"" ""No,"" said Percy, grinning, ""they tried to do it three times. The first time my grandfather corrupted a whole department of the State survey; the second time he had the official maps of the United States tinkered with(cid:20)that held them for fifteen years. The last time was harder. My father fixed it so that their compasses were in the strongest magnetic field ever artificially set up. He had a whole set of surveying instruments made with a slight defection that would allow for this territory not to appear, and he substituted them for the ones that were to be used. Then he had a river deflected and he had what looked like a village built up on its banks(cid:20)so that they'd see it, and think it was a town ten miles farther up the valley. There's only one thing my father's afraid of,"" he concluded, ""only one thing in the world that could be used to find us out."" ""What's that?"" Percy sank his voice to a whisper. ""Aeroplanes,"" he breathed. ""We've got half a dozen antiaircraft guns and we've arranged it so far(cid:20)but there've been a few deaths and a great many prisoners. Not that we mind that, you know, father and I, but it upsets mother and the girls, and there's always the chance that some time we won't be able to arrange it."" Shreds and tatters of chinchilla, courtesy clouds in the green moon's heaven, were passing the green moon like precious Eastern stuffs paraded for the inspection of some Tartar Khan. It seemed to John that it was day, and that he was looking at some lads sailing above him in the air, showering down tracts and patent medicine circulars, with their messages of hope for despairing, rockbound hamlets. It seemed to him that he could see them look down out of the clouds and stare(cid:20)and stare at whatever there was to stare at in this place whither he was bound(cid:20)What then? Were they induced to land by some insidious device there to be immured far from patent medicines and from tracts until the judgment day(cid:20)or, should they fail to fall into the trap, did a quick puff of smoke and the sharp round of a splitting shell bring them drooping to earth(cid:20)and ""upset"" Percy's mother and sisters. John shook his head and the wraith of a hollow laugh issued silently from his parted lips. What desperate transaction lay hidden here? What a moral expedient of a bizarre Croesus? What terrible and golden mystery? . . . The chinchilla clouds had drifted past now and outside the Montana night was bright as day. The tapestry brick of the road was smooth to the tread of the great tires as they rounded a still, moonlit lake; they passed into darkness for a moment, a pine grove, pungent and cool, then they came out into a broad avenue of lawn and John's exclamation of pleasure was simultaneous with Percy's taciturn ""We're home."" Full in the light of the stars, an exquisite ch_teau rose from the borders of the lake, climbed in marble radiance half the height of an adjoining mountain, then melted in grace, in perfect symmetry, in translucent feminine languor, into the massed darkness of a forest of pine. The many towers, the slender tracery of the sloping parapets, the chiselled wonder of a thousand yellow windows with their oblongs and hectagons and triangles of golden light, the shattered softness of the intersecting planes of starshine and blue shade, all trembled on John's spirit like a chord of music. On one of the towers, the tallest, the blackest at its base, an arrangement of exterior lights at the top made a sort of floating fairyland(cid:20)and as John gazed up in warm enchantment the faint acciaccare sound of violins drifted down in a rococo harmony that was like nothing he had ever heard before. Then in a moment the car stopped before wide, high marble steps around which the night air was fragrant with a host of flowers. At the top of the steps two great doors swung silently open and amber light flooded out upon the darkness, silhouetting the figure of an exquisite lady with black, highpiled hair, who held out her arms toward them. ""Mother,"" Percy was saying, ""this is my friend, John Unger, from Hades."" II 5 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz Afterward John remembered that first night as a daze of many colors, of quick sensory impressions, of music soft as a voice in love, and of the beauty of things, lights and shadows, and motions and faces. There was a whitehaired man who stood drinking a manyhued cordial from a crystal thimble set on a golden stem. There was a girl",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),4,"with a flowery face, dressed like Titania with braided sapphires in her hair. There was a room where the solid, soft gold of the walls yielded to the pressure of his hand, and a room that was like a platonic conception of the ultimate prism(cid:20)ceiling, floor, and all, it was lined with an unbroken mass of diamonds, diamonds of every size and shape, until, lit with tall violet lamps in the corners, it dazzled the eyes with a whiteness that could be compared only with itself, beyond human wish or dream. Through a maze of these rooms the two boys wandered. Sometimes the floor under their feet would flame in brilliant patterns from lighting below, patterns of barbaric clashing colors, of pastel delicacy, of sheer whiteness, or of subtle and intricate mosaic, surely from some mosque on the Adriatic Sea. Sometimes beneath layers of thick crystal he would see blue or green water swirling, inhabited by vivid fish and growths of rainbow foliage. Then they would be treading on furs of every texture and color or along corridors of palest ivory, unbroken as though carved complete from the gigantic tusks of dinosaurs extinct before the age of man. . . . Then a hazily remembered transition, and they were at dinner(cid:20)where each plate was of two almost imperceptible layers of solid diamond between which was curiously worked a filigree of emerald design, a shaving sliced from green air. Music, plangent and unobtrusive, drifted down through far corridors(cid:20)his chair, feathered and curved insidiously to his back, seemed to engulf and overpower him as he drank his first glass of port. He tried drowsily to answer a question that had been asked him, but the honeyed luxury that clasped his body added to the illusion of sleep(cid:20)jewels, fabrics, wines, and metals blurred before his eyes into a sweet mist. . . . ""Yes,"" he replied with a polite effort, ""it certainly is hot enough for me down there."" He managed to add a ghostly laugh; then, without movement, without resistance, he seemed to float off and away, leaving an iced dessert that was pink as a dream. . . . He fell asleep. When he awoke he knew that several hours had passed. He was in a great quiet room with ebony walls and a dull illumination that was too faint, too subtle, to be called a light. His young host was standing over him. ""You fell asleep at dinner,"" Percy was saying. ""I nearly did, too(cid:20)it was such a treat to be comfortable again after this year of school. Servants undressed and bathed you while you were sleeping."" ""Is this a bed or a cloud?"" sighed John. ""Percy, Percy(cid:20)before you go, I want to apologize."" ""For what?"" ""For doubting you when you said you had a diamond as big as the RitzCarlton Hotel."" Percy smiled. ""I thought you didn't believe me. It's that mountain, you know."" ""What mountain?"" ""The mountain the ch_teau rests on. It's not very big, for a mountain. But except about fifty feet of sod and gravel on top it's solid diamond.One diamond, one cubic mile without a flaw. Aren't you listening? Say(cid:20) (cid:20)"" But John T. Unger had again fallen asleep. II 6 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz III MORNING. As he awoke he perceived drowsily that the room had at the same moment become dense with sunlight. The ebony panels of one wall had slid aside on a sort of track, leaving his chamber half open to the day. A large negro in a white uniform stood beside his bed. ""Goodevening,"" muttered John, summoning his brains from the wild places. ""Goodmorning, sir. Are you ready for your bath, sir? Oh, don't get up(cid:20)I'll put you in, if you'll just unbutton your pajamas(cid:20)there. Thank you, sir."" John lay quietly as his pajamas were removed(cid:20)he was amused and delighted; he expected to be lifted like a child by this black Gargantua who was tending him, but nothing of the sort happened; instead he felt the bed tilt up slowly on its side(cid:20)he began to roll, startled at first, in the direction of the wall, but when he reached the wall its drapery gave way, and sliding two yards farther down a fleecy incline he plumped gently into water the same temperature as his body. He looked about him. The runway or rollway on which he had arrived had folded gently back into place. He had been projected into another chamber and was sitting in a sunken bath with his head just above the level of the floor. All about him, lining the walls of the room and the sides and bottom of the bath itself, was a blue aquarium, and gazing through the crystal surface on which he sat, he could see fish swimming among amber",no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),5,"lights and even gliding without curiosity past his outstretched toes, which were separated from them only by the thickness of the crystal. From overhead, sunlight came down through seagreen glass. I suppose, sir, that you'd like hot rosewater and soapsuds this morning sir(cid:20)and perhaps cold salt water to finish."" The negro was standing beside him. ""Yes,"" agreed John, smiling inanely, ""as you please."" Any idea of ordering this bath according to his own meager standards of living would have been priggish and not a little wicked. The negro pressed a button and a warm rain began to fall, apparently from overhead, but really, so John discovered after a moment, from a fountain arrangement near by. The water turned to a pale rose color and jets of liquid soap spurted into it from four miniature walrus heads at the corners of the bath. In a moment a dozen little paddlewheels, fixed to the sides, had churned the mixture into a radiant rainbow of pink foam which enveloped him softly with its delicious lightness, and burst in shining, rosy bubbles here and there about him. ""Shall I turn on the movingpicture machine, sir?"" suggested the negro deferentially. ""There's a good onereel comedy in this machine today, or can put in a serious piece in a moment, if you prefer it."" ""No, thanks,"" answered John, politely but firmly. He was enjoying his at too much to desire any distraction. But distraction came. In a moment he was listening intently to the sound of flutes from just outside, flutes ripping a melody that was like a waterfall, cool and green as the room itself, accompanying a frothy piccolo, in play more fragile than the lace of u s that covered and charmed him. After a cold saltwater bracer and a cold fresh finish, he stepped out and into a fleecy robe, and upon a couch covered with the same material he was rubbed with oil, alcohol, and spice. Later he sat in a voluptuous chair while he was shaved and his hair was trimmed. ""Mr. Percy is waiting in your sittingroom,"" said the negro, when these operations were finished. ""My name is III 7 Gygsum, Mr. Unger, sir. I am to see to Mr. Unger every morning."" The Diamond as Big as the Ritz John walked out into the brisk sunshine of his livingroom, where he found breakfast waiting for him and Percy, gorgeous in white kid knickerbockers, smoking in an easy chair. IV THIS IS A STORY of the Washington family as Percy sketched it for John during breakfast. The father of the present Mr. Washington had been a Virginian, a direct descendant of George Washington, and Lord Baltimore. At the close of the Civil War he was a twentyfiveyearold Colonel with a playedout plantation and about a thousand dollars in gold. FitzNorman Culpepper Washington, for that was the young Colonel's name, decided to present the Virginia estate to his younger brother and go West. He selected two dozen of the most faithful blacks, who, of course, worshipped him, and bought twentyfive tickets to the West, where he intended to take out land in their names and start a sheep and cattle ranch. When he had been in Montana for less than a month and things were going very poorly indeed, he stumbled on his great discovery. He had lost his way when riding in the hills, and after a day without food he began to grow hungry. As he was without his rifle, he was forced to pursue a squirrel, and in the course of the pursuit he noticed that it was carrying something shiny in its mouth. Just before it vanished into its hole(cid:20)for Providence did not intend that this squirrel should alleviate his hunger(cid:20)it dropped its burden. Sitting down to consider the situation FitzNorman's eye was caught by a gleam in the grass beside him. In ten seconds he had completely lost his appetite and gained one hundred thousand dollars. The squirrel, which had refused with annoying persistence to become food, had made him a present of a large and perfect diamond. Late that night he found his way to camp and twelve hours later all the males among his darkies were back by the squirrel hole digging furiously at the side of the mountain. He told them he had discovered a rhinestone mine, and, as only one or two of them had ever seen even a small diamond before, they believed him, without question. When the magnitude of his discovery became apparent to him, he found himself in a quandary. The mountain was a diamond(cid:20)it was literally nothing else but solid diamond. He filled four saddle bags full of glittering samples and started on horseback for St. Paul. There he managed to dispose of half a dozen small stones(cid:20)when",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),6,"he tried a larger one a storekeeper fainted and FitzNorman was arrested as a public disturber. He escaped from jail and caught the train for New York, where he sold a few mediumsized diamonds and received in exchange about two hundred thousand dollars in gold. But he did not dare to produce any exceptional gems(cid:20)in fact, he left New York just in time. Tremendous excitement had been created in jewelry circles, not so much by the size of his diamonds as by their appearance in the city from mysterious sources. Wild rumors became current that a diamond mine had been discovered in the Catskills, on the Jersey coast, on Long Island, beneath Washington Square. Excursion trains, packed with men carrying picks and shovels, began to leave New York hourly, bound for various neighboring El Dorados. But by that time young FitzNorman was on his way back to Montana. By the end of a fortnight he had estimated that the diamond in the mountain was approximately equal in quantity to all the rest of the diamonds known to exist in the world. There was no valuing it by any regular computation, however, for it was one solid diamond(cid:20)and if it were offered for sale not only would the bottom fall out of the market, but also, if the value should vary with its size in the usual arithmetical progression, there would not be enough gold in the world to buy a tenth part of it. And what could any one do with a diamond that size? It was an amazing predicament. He was, in one sense, the richest man that ever lived(cid:20)and yet was he worth anything at all? If his secret should transpire there was no telling to what measures the Government might resort IV 8 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz in order to prevent a panic, in gold as well as in jewels. They might take over the claim immediately and institute a monopoly. There was no alternative(cid:20)he must market his mountain in secret. He sent South for his younger brother and put him in charge of his colored following(cid:20)darkies who had never realized that slavery was abolished. To make sure of this, he read them a proclamation that he had composed, which announced that General Forrest had reorganized the shattered Southern armies and defeated the North in one pitched battle. The negroes believed him implicitly. They passed a vote declaring it a good thing and held revival services immediately. FitzNorman himself set out for foreign parts with one hundred thousand dollars and two trunks filled with rough diamonds of all sizes. He sailed for Russia in a Chinese junk and six months after his departure from Montana he was in St. Petersburg. He took obscure lodgings and called immediately upon the court jeweller, announcing that he had a diamond for the Czar. He remained in St. Petersburg for two weeks, in constant danger of being murdered, living from lodging to lodging, and afraid to visit his trunks more than three or four times during the whole fortnight. On his promise to return in a year with larger and finer stones, he was allowed to leave for India. Before he left, however, the Court Treasurers had deposited to his credit, in American banks, the sum of fifteen million dollars(cid:20)under four different aliases. He returned to America in 1868, having been gone a little over two years. He had visited the capitals of twentytwo countries and talked with five emperors, eleven kings, three princes, a shah, a khan, and a sultan. At that time FitzNorman estimated his own wealth at one billion dollars. One fact worked consistently against the disclosure of his secret. No one of his larger diamonds remained in the public eye for a week before being invested with a history of enough fatalities, amours, revolutions, and wars to have occupied it from the days of the first Babylonian Empire. From 1870 until his death in 1900, the history of FitzNorman Washington was a long epic in gold. There were side issues, of course(cid:20)he evaded the surveys, he married a Virginia lady, by whom he had a single son, and he was compelled, due to a series of unfortunate complications, to murder his brother, whose unfortunate habit of drinking himself into an indiscreet stupor had several times endangered their safety. But very few other murders stained these happy years of progress and expansion. Just before he died he changed his policy, and with all but a few million dollars of his outside wealth bought up rare minerals in bulk, which he deposited in the safety vaults of banks all over the world, marked as bric_brac. His son, Braddock Tarleton Washington, followed this policy on an even more tensive scale. The minerals were converted into the rarest",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),7,"of all elements(cid:20)radium(cid:20)so that the equivalent of a billion dollars in gold could be placed in a receptacle no bigger than a cigar box. When FitzNorman had been dead three years his son, Braddock, decided that the business had gone far enough. The amount of wealth that he and his father had taken out of the mountain was beyond all exact computation. He kept a notebook in cipher in which he set down the approximate quantity of radium in each of the thousand banks he patronized, and recorded the alias under which it was held. Then he did a very simple thing(cid:20)he sealed up the mine. He sealed up the mine. What had been taken out of it would support all the Washingtons yet to be born in unparalleled luxury for generations. His one care must be the protection of his secret, lest in the possible panic attendant on its discovery he should be reduced with all the propertyholders in the world to utter poverty. This was the family among whom John T. Unger was staying. This was the story he heard in his silverwalled livingroom the morning after his arrival. IV 9 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz IV AFTER BREAKFAST, John found his way out the great marble entrance and looked curiously at the scene before him. The whole valley, from the diamond mountain to the steep granite cliff five miles away, still gave off a breath of golden haze which hovered idly above the fine sweep of lawns and lakes and gardens. Here and there clusters of elms made delicate groves of shade, contrasting strangely with the tough masses of pine forest that held the hills in a grip of darkblue green. Even as John looked he saw three fawns in single file patter out from one clump about a half mile away and disappear with awkward gayety into the blackribbed halflight of another. John would not have been surprised to see a goatfoot piping his way among the trees or to catch a glimpse of pink nymphskin and flying yellow hair between the greenest of the green leaves. In some such cool hope he descended the marble steps, disturbing faintly the sleep of two silky Russian wolfhounds at the bottom, and set off along a walk of white and blue brick that seemed to lead in no particular direction. He was enjoying himself as much as he was able. It is youth's felicity as well as its insufficiency that it can never live in the present, but must always be measuring up the day against its own radiantly imagined future(cid:20)flowers and gold, girls and stars, they are only prefigurations and prophecies of that incomparable, unattainable young dream. John rounded a soft corner where the massed rosebushes filled the air with heavy scent, and struck off across a park toward a patch of moss under some trees. He had never lain upon moss, and he wanted to see whether it was really soft enough to justify the use of its name as an adjective. Then he saw a girl coming toward him over the grass. She was the most beautiful person he had ever seen She was dressed in a white little gown that came just below her knees, and a wreath of mignonettes clasped with blue slices of sapphire bound up her hair. Her pink bare feet scattered the dew before them as she came. She was younger than John(cid:20)not more than sixteen. ""Hello,"" she cried softly, ""I'm Kismine."" She was much more than that to John already. He advanced toward her, scarcely moving as he drew near lest he should tread on her bare toes. ""You haven't met me,"" said her soft voice. Her blue eyes added, ""Oh, but you've missed a great deal!"" . . . ""You met my sister, Jasmine, last night. I was sick with lettuce poisoning,"" went on her soft voice, and her eyes continued, ""and when I'm sick I'm sweet(cid:20)and when I'm well."" ""You have made an enormous impression on me,"" said John's eyes, ""and I'm not so slow myself""(cid:20)""How do you do?"" said his voice. ""I hope you're better this morning.""(cid:20)""You darling,"" added his eyes tremulously. John observed that they had been walking along the path. On her suggestion they sat down together upon the moss, the softness of which he failed to determine. He was critical about women. A single defect(cid:20)a thick ankle, a hoarse voice, a glass eye(cid:20)was enough to make him utterly indifferent. And here for the first time in his life he was beside a girl who seemed to him the incarnation of physical perfection. ""Are you from the East?"" asked Kismine with charming interest. IV 10 ""No,"" answered John simply. ""I'm from Hades."" The Diamond as Big as the Ritz Either she had",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),8,"never heard of Hades, or she could think of no pleasant comment to make upon it, for she did not discuss it further. ""I'm going East to school this fall,"" she said. ""D'you think I'll like it? I'm going to New York to Miss Bulge's. It's very strict, but you see over the weekends I'm going to live at home with the family in our New York house, because father heard that the girls had to go walking two by two."" ""Your father wants you to be proud,"" observed John. ""We are,"" she answered, her eyes shining with dignity.""None of us has ever been punished. Father said we never should be. Once when my sister Jasmine was a little girl she pushed him downstairs and he just got up and limped away. ""Mother was(cid:20)well, a little startled,"" continued Kismine, ""when she heard that you were from(cid:20)from where you are from, you know. She said that when she was a young girl(cid:20)but then, you see, she's a Spaniard and oldfashioned."" ""Do you spend much time out here?"" asked John, to conceal the fact that he was somewhat hurt by this remark. It seemed an unkind allusion to his provincialism. ""Percy and Jasmine and I are here every summer, but next summer Jasmine is going to Newport. She's coming out in London a year from this fall. She'll be presented at court."" ""Do you know, "" began John hesitantly, ""you're much more sophisticated than I thought you were when I first saw you?"" ""Oh, no, I'm not,"" she exclaimed hurriedly. ""Oh, I wouldn't think of being. I think that sophisticated young people are terribly common, don't you? I'm not at all, really. If you say I am, I'm going to cry."" She was so distressed that her lip was trembling. John was impelled to protest: I didn't mean that; I only said it to tease you."" ""Because I wouldn't mind if I were,"" she persisted. ""but I'm not. I'm very innocent and girlish. I never smoke, or drink, or read anything except poetry. I know scarcely any mathematics or chemistry. I dress very simply(cid:20)in fact, I scarcely dress at all. I think sophisticated is the last thing you can say about me. I believe that girls ought to enjoy their youths in a wholesome way."" ""I do, too,"" said John heartily. Kismine was cheerful again. She smiled at him, and a stillborn tear dripped from the corner of one blue eye. ""I like you,"" she whispered, intimately. ""Are you going to spend all your time with Percy while you're here, or will you be nice to me. Just think(cid:20)I'm absolutely fresh ground. I've never had a boy in love with me in all my life. I've never been allowed even to see boys alone(cid:20)except Percy. I came all the way out here into this grove hoping to run into you, where the family wouldn't be around. Deeply flattered, John bowed from the hips as he had been taught at dancing school in Hades. IV 11 ""We'd better go now,"" said Kismine sweetly. ""I have to be with mother at eleven. You haven't asked me to kiss you once. I thought boys always did that nowadays."" The Diamond as Big as the Ritz John drew himself up proudly. ""Some of them do,"" he answered, ""but not me. Girls don't do that sort of thing(cid:20)in Hades."" Side by side they walked back toward the house. VI JOHN STOOD facing Mr. Braddock Washington in the full sunlight. The elder man was about forty with a proud, vacuous face, intelligent eyes, and a robust figure. In the mornings he smelt of horses(cid:20)the best horses. He carried a plain walkingstick of gray birch with a single large opal for a grip. He and Percy were showing John around. ""The slaves' quarters are there."" His walkingstick indicated a cloister of marble on their left that ran in graceful Gothic along the side of the mountain. ""In my youth I was distracted for a while from the business of life by a period of absurd idealism. During that time they lived in luxury. For instance, I equipped every one of their rooms with a tile bath."" ""I suppose,"" ventured John, with an ingratiating laugh, ""that they used the bathtubs to keep coal in. Mr. SchnlitzerMurphy told me that once he(cid:20) (cid:20)"" ""The opinions of Mr. SchnlitzerMurphy are of little importance, I should imagine,"" interrupted Braddock Washington, coldly. ""My slaves did not keep coal in their bathtubs. They had orders to bathe every day, and they did. If they hadn't I might have ordered a sulphuric acid shampoo. I discontinued the baths for quite another reason. Several of them caught cold and died. Water is not good for certain races(cid:20)except as a beverage."" John laughed, and then decided to nod",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),9,"his head in sober agreement. Braddock Washington made him uncomfortable. ""All these negroes are descendants of the ones my father brought North with him. There are about two hundred and fifty now. You notice that they've lived so long apart from the world that their original dialect has become an almost indistinguishable patois. We bring a few of them up to speak English(cid:20)my secretary and two or three of the house servants. ""This is the golf course,"" he continued, as they strolled along the velvet winter grass. ""It's all a green, you see(cid:20)no fairway, no rough, no hazards."" He smiled pleasantly at John. ""Many men in the cage, father?"" asked Percy suddenly. Braddock Washington stumbled, and let forth an involuntary curse. ""One less than there should be,"" he ejaculated darkly(cid:20)and then added after a moment, ""We've had difficulties."" ""Mother was telling me,"" exclaimed Percy, ""that Italian teacher(cid:20) (cid:20)"" ""A ghastly error,"" said Braddock Washington angrily. ""But of course there's a good chance that we may have got VI 12 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz him. Perhaps he fell somewhere in the woods or stumbled over a cliff. And then there's always the probability that if he did get away his story wouldn't be believed. Nevertheless, I've had two dozen men looking for him in different towns around here."" ""And no luck?"" ""Some. Fourteen of them reported to my agent that they'd each killed a man answering to that description, but of (cid:20)"" course it was probably only the reward they were after(cid:20) He broke off. They had come to a large cavity in the earth about the circumference of a merrygoround and covered by a strong iron grating. Braddock Washington beckoned to John, and pointed his cane down through the grating. John stepped to the edge and gazed. Immediately his ears were assailed by a wild clamor from below. ""Come on down to Hell!"" ""Hello, kiddo, how's the air up there?"" ""Hey! Throw us a rope!"" ""Got an old doughnut, Buddy, or a couple of secondhand sandwiches?"" ""Say, fella, if you'll push down that guy you're with, we'll show you a quick disappearance scene."" ""Paste him one for me, will you?"" It was too dark to see clearly into the pit below, but John could tell from the coarse optimism and rugged vitality of the remarks and voices that they proceeded from middleclass Americans of the more spirited type. Then Mr. Washington put out his cane and touched a button in the grass, and the scene below sprang into light. ""These are some adventurous mariners who had the misfortune to discover El Dorado,"" he remarked. Below them there had appeared a large hollow in the earth shaped like the interior of a bowl. The sides were steep and apparently of polished glass, and on its slightly concave surface stood about two dozen men clad in the half costume, half uniform, of aviators. Their upturned faces, lit with wrath with malice, with despair, with cynical humor, were covered by long growths of beard, but with the exception of a few who had pined perceptibly away, they seemed to be a wellfed, healthy lot. Braddock Washington drew a garden chair to the edge of the pit and sat down. ""Well, how are you, boys?"" he inquired genially. A chorus of execration in which all joined except a few too dispirited to cry out, rose up into the sunny air, but Braddock Washington heard it with unruffled composure. When its last echo had died away he spoke again. ""Have you thought up a way out of your difficulty?"" From here and there among them a remark floated up. ""We decided to stay here for love!"" ""Bring us up there and we'll find us a way!"" VI 13 Braddock Washington waited until they were again quiet. Then he said: The Diamond as Big as the Ritz ""I've told you the situation. I don't want you here. I wish to heaven I'd never seen you. Your own curiosity got you here, and any time that you can think of a way out which protects me and my interests I'll be glad to consider it. But so long as you confine your efforts to digging tunnels(cid:20)yes, I know about the new one you've started(cid:20)you won't get very far. This isn't as hard on you as you make it out, with all your howling for the loved ones at home. If you were the type who worried much about the loved ones at home, you'd never have taken up aviation."" A tall man moved apart from the others, and held up his hand to call his captor's attention to what he was about to say. ""Let me ask you a few questions!"" he cried. ""You pretend to be a fairminded man."" ""How absurd. How could",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),10,"a man of my position be fairminded toward you? You might as well speak of a Spaniard being fairminded toward a piece of steak."" At this harsh observation the faces of the two dozen steaks fell, but the tall man continued: ""All right!"" he cried. ""We've argued this out before. You're not a humanitarian and you're not fairminded, but you're human(cid:20)at least you say you are(cid:20)and you ought to be able to put yourself in our place for long enough to think how(cid:20)how(cid:20)how(cid:20) ""How what?"" demanded Washington, coldly. ""(cid:20)how unnecessary(cid:20) (cid:20)"" ""Not to me."" ""Well,(cid:20)how cruel(cid:20) (cid:20)"" ""We've covered that. Cruelty doesn't exist where selfpreservation is involved. You've been soldiers; you know that. Try another."" ""Well, then, how stupid."" ""There,"" admitted Washington, ""I grant you that. But try to think of an alternative. I've offered to have all or any of you painlessly executed if you wish. I've offered to have your wives, sweethearts, children, and mothers kidnapped and brought out here. I'll enlarge your place down there and feed and clothe you the rest of your lives. If there was some method of producing permanent amnesia I'd have all of you operated on and released immediately, somewhere outside of my preserves. But that's as far as my ideas go."" ""How about trusting us not to peach on you?"" cried some one. ""You don't proffer that suggestion seriously,"" said Washington, with an expression of scorn. ""I did take out one man to teach my daughter Italian. Last week he got away."" A wild yell of jubilation went up suddenly from two dozen throats and a pandemonium of joy ensued. The prisoners clogdanced and cheered and yodled and wrestled with one another in a sudden uprush of animal spirits. They even ran up the glass sides of the bowl as far as they could, and slid back to the bottom upon the natural cushions of their bodies. The tall man started a song in which they all joined(cid:20) ""oh, we'll hang the kaiser on a sour apple tree(cid:20) (cid:20)"" VI 14 (cid:20) The Diamond as Big as the Ritz Braddock Washington sat in inscrutable silence until the song was over. ""You see,"" he remarked, when he could gain a modicum of attention. ""I bear you no illwill. I like to see you enjoying yourselves. That's why I didn't tell you the whole story at once. The man(cid:20)what was his name? Critchtichiello? (cid:20)was shot by some of my agents in fourteen different places."" Not guessing that the places referred to were cities, the tumult of rejoicing subsided immediately. ""Nevertheless,"" cried Washington with a touch of anger, ""he tried to run away. Do you expect me to take chances with any of you after an experience like that?"" Again a series of ejaculations went up. ""Sure!"" ""Would your daughter like to learn Chinese?"" ""Hey, I can speak Italian! My mother was a wop."" ""Maybe she'd like t'learna speak N'Yawk!"" ""If she's the little one with the big blue eyes I can teach her a lot of things better than Italian."" ""I know some Irish songs(cid:20)and I could hammer brass once't. Mr. Washington reached forward suddenly with his cane and pushed the button in the grass so that the picture below went out instantly, and there remained only that great dark mouth covered dismally with the black teeth of the grating. ""Hey!"" called a single voice from below, ""you ain't goin' away without givin' us your blessing?"" But Mr. Washington, followed by the two boys, was already strolling on toward the ninth hole of the golf course, as though the pit and its contents were no more than a hazard over which his facile iron had triumphed with ease. VII JULY UNDER the lee of the diamond mountain was a month of blanket nights and of warm, glowing days. John and Kismine were in love. He did not know that the little gold football (inscribed with the legend Pro deo et patria et St. Midas) which he had given her rested on a platinum chain next to her bosom. But it did. And she for her part was not aware that a large sapphire which had dropped one day from her simple coiffure was stowed away tenderly in John's jewel box. Late one afternoon when the ruby and ermine music room was quiet, they spent an hour there together. He held her hand and she gave him such a look that he whispered her name aloud. She bent toward him(cid:20)then hesitated. ""Did you say 'Kismine'?"" she asked softly, ""or(cid:20) (cid:20)"" She had wanted to be sure. She thought she might have misunderstood. Neither of them had ever kissed before, but in the course of an hour it seemed to make little difference. VII 15 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz The afternoon drifted",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),11,"away. That night when a last breath of music drifted down from the highest tower, they each lay awake, happily dreaming over the separate minutes of the day. They had decided to be married as soon as possible. VIII EVERY DAY Mr. Washington and the two young men went hunting or fishing in the deep forests or played golf around the somnolent course(cid:20)games which John diplomatically allowed his host to win(cid:20)or swam in the mountain coolness of the lake. John found Mr. Washington a somewhat exacting personality(cid:20)utterly uninterested in any ideas or opinions except his own. Mrs. Washington was aloof and reserved at all times. She was apparently indifferent to her two daughters, and entirely absorbed in her son Percy, with whom she held interminable conversations in rapid Spanish at dinner. Jasmine, the elder daughter, resembled Kismine in appearance(cid:20)except that she was somewhat bowlegged, and terminated in large hands and feet(cid:20)but was utterly unlike her in temperament. Her favorite books had to do with poor girls who kept house for widowed fathers. John learned from Kismine that Jasmine had never recovered from the shock and disappointment caused her by the termination of the World War, just as she was about to start for Europe as a canteen expert. She had even pined away for a time, and Braddock Washington had taken steps to promote a new war in the Balkans(cid:20)but she had seen a photograph of some wounded Serbian soldiers and lost interest in the whole proceedings. But Percy and Kismine seemed to have inherited the arrogant attitude in all its harsh magnificence from their father. A chaste and consistent selfishness ran like a pattern through their every idea. John was enchanted by the wonders of the ch_teau and the valley. Braddock Washington, so Percy told him, had caused to be kidnapped a landscape gardener, an architect, a designer of state settings, and a French decadent poet left over from the last century. He had put his entire force of negroes at their disposal, guaranteed to supply them with any materials that the world could offer, and left them to work out some ideas of their own. But one by one they had shown their uselessness. The decadent poet had at once begun bewailing his separation from the boulevards in spring(cid:20)he made some vague remarks about spices, apes, and ivories, but said nothing that was of any practical value. The stage designer on his part wanted to make the whole valley a series of tricks and sensational effects(cid:20)a state of things that the Washingtons would soon have grown tired of. And as for the architect and the landscape gardener, they thought only in terms of convention. They must make this like this and that like that. But they had, at least, solved the problem of what was to be done with them(cid:20)they all went mad early one morning after spending the night in a single room trying to agree upon the location of a fountain, and were now confined comfortably in an insane asylum at Westport, Connecticut. ""But,"" inquired John curiously, ""who did plan all your wonderful reception rooms and halls, and approaches and bathrooms(cid:20) (cid:20)?"" ""Well,"" answered Percy, ""I blush to tell you, but it was a movingpicture fella. He was the only man we found who was used to playing with an unlimited amount of money, though he did tuck his napkin in his collar and couldn't read or write."" As August drew to a close John began to regret that he must soon go back to school. He and Kismine had decided to elope the following June. ""It would be nicer to be married here,"" Kismine confessed, ""but of course I could never get father's permission to marry you at all. Next to that I'd rather elope. It's terrible for wealthy people to be married in America at VIII 16 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz present(cid:20)they always have to send out bulletins to the press saying that they're going to be married in remnants, when what they mean is just a peck of old secondhand pearls and some used lace worn once by the Empress Eug_nie."" ""I know,"" agreed John fervently. ""When I was visiting the SchnlitzerMurphys, the eldest daughter, Gwendolyn, married a man whose father owns half of West Virginia. She wrote home saying what a tough struggle she was carrying on on his salary as a bank clerk(cid:20)and then she ended up by saying that 'Thank God, I have four good maids anyhow, and that helps a little.'"" ""It's absurd,"" commented Kismine. ""Think of the millions and millions of people in the world, laborers and all, who get along with only two maids."" One afternoon late in August a chance remark of Kismine's changed the face of the entire situation, and threw John",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),12,"into a state of terror. They were in their favorite grove, and between kisses John was indulging in some romantic forebodings which he fancied added poignancy to their relations. ""Sometimes I think we'll never marry,"" he said sadly. ""You're too wealthy, too magnificent. No one as rich as you are can be like other girls. I should marry the daughter of some welltodo wholesale hardware man from Omaha or Sioux City, and be content with her halfmillion."" ""I knew the daughter of a wholesale hardware man once,"" remarked Kismine. ""I don't think you'd have been contented with her. She was a friend of my sister's. She visited here."" ""Oh, then you've had other guests?"" exclaimed John in surprise. Kismine seemed to regret her words. ""Oh, yes,"" she said hurriedly, ""we've had a few."" ""But aren't you(cid:20)wasn't your father afraid they'd talk outside?"" ""Oh, to some extent, to some extent,"" she answered. ""Let's talk about something pleasanter."" But John's curiosity was aroused. ""Something pleasanter!"" he demanded. ""What's unpleasant about that? Weren't they nice girls?"" To his great surprise Kismine began to weep. ""Yes(cid:20)th(cid:20)that's the(cid:20)the whole ttrouble. I grew ququite attached to some of them. So did Jasmine, but she kept invviting them anyway. I couldn't understand it."" A dark suspicion was born in John's heart. ""Do you mean that they told, and your father had them(cid:20)removed?"" VIII 17 ""Worse than that,"" she muttered brokenly. ""Father took no chances(cid:20)and Jasmine kept writing them to come, and they had such a good time!"" The Diamond as Big as the Ritz She was overcome by a paroxysm of grief. Stunned with the horror of this revelation, John sat there openmouthed, feeling the nerves of his body twitter like so many sparrows perched upon his spinal column. ""Now, I've told you, and I shouldn't have,"" she said, calming suddenly and drying her dark blue eyes. ""Do you mean to say that your father had them murdered before they left?"" She nodded. ""In August usually(cid:20)or early in September. It's only natural for us to get all the pleasure out of them that we can first."" ""How abdominable! How(cid:20)why, I must be going crazy! Did you really admit that(cid:20)"" ""I did,"" interrupted Kismine, shrugging her shoulders. ""We can't very well imprison them like those aviators, where they'd be a continual reproach to us every day. And it's always been made easier for Jasmine and me because father had it done sooner than we expected. In that way we avoided any farewell scene(cid:20) (cid:20)"" ""So you murdered them! Uh!"" cried John. ""It was done very nicely. They were drugged while they were asleep(cid:20)and their families were always told that they died of scarlet fever in Butte."" ""But(cid:20)I fail to understand why you kept on inviting them!"" ""I didn't,"" burst out Kismine. ""I never invited one. Jasmine did. And they always had a very good time. She'd give them the nicest presents toward the last. I shall probably have visitors too(cid:20)I'll harden up to it. We can't let such an inevitable thing as death stand in the way of enjoying life while we have it. Think how lonesome it'd be out here if we never had any one. Why, father and mother have sacrificed some of their best friends just as we have."" ""And so,"" cried John accusingly, ""and so you were letting me make love to you and pretending to return it, and talking about marriage, all the time knowing perfectly well that I'd never get out of here alive(cid:20)"" ""No,"" she protested passionately. ""Not any more. I did at first. You were here. I couldn't help that, and I thought your last days might as well be pleasant for both of us. But then I fell in love with you, and(cid:20)and I'm honestly sorry you're going to(cid:20)going to be put away(cid:20)though I'd rather you'd be put away than ever kiss another girl."" ""Oh, you would, would you?"" cried John ferociously. ""Much rather. Besides, I've always heard that a girl can have more fun with a man whom she knows she can never marry. Oh, why did I tell you? I've probably spoiled your whole good time now, and we were really enjoying things when you didn't know it. I knew it would make things sort of depressing for you."" ""Oh, you did, did you?"" John's voice trembled with anger. ""I've heard about enough of this. If you haven't any more pride and decency than to have an affair with a fellow that you know isn't much better than a corpse, I don't want to have any more to do with you!"" VIII 18 ""You're not a corpse!"" she protested in horror. ""You're not a corpse! I won't have you saying that I kissed a corpse!"" The Diamond as Big as the Ritz ""I said nothing of the",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),13,"sort!"" ""You did! You said I kissed a corpse!"" ""I didn't ! "" Their voices had risen, but upon a sudden interruption they both subsided into immediate silence. Footsteps were coming along the path in their direction, and a moment later the rose bushes were parted displaying Braddock Washington, whose intelligent eyes set in his goodlooking vacuous face were peering in at them. ""Who kissed a corpse?"" he demanded in obvious disapproval. ""Nobody,"" answered Kismine quickly. ""We were just joking."" ""What are you two doing here, anyhow?"" he demanded gruffly. ""Kismine, you ought to be(cid:20)to be reading or playing golf with your sister. Go read! Go play golf! Don't let me find you here when I come back!"" Then he bowed at John and went up the path. ""See?"" said Kismine crossly, when he was out of hearing. ""You've spoiled it all. We can never meet any more. He won't let me meet you. He'd have you poisoned if he thought we were in love."" ""We're not, any more!"" cried John fiercely, ""so he can set his mind at rest upon that. Moreover, don't fool yourself that I'm going to stay around here. Inside of six hours I'll be over those mountains, if I have to gnaw a passage through them, and on my way East."" They had both got to their feet, and at this remark Kismine came close and put her arm through his. ""I'm going, too."" ""You must be crazy(cid:20) (cid:20)"" ""Of course I'm going,"" she interrupted impatiently. ""You most certainly are not. You(cid:20) (cid:20)"" ""Very well,"" she said quietly, ""we'll catch up with father now and talk it over with him."" Defeated, John mustered a sickly smile. ""Very well, dearest,"" he agreed, with pale and unconvincing affection, ""we'll go together."" His love for her returned and settled placidly on his heart. She was his(cid:20)she would go with him to share his dangers. He put his arms about her and kissed her fervently. After all she loved him; she had saved him, in fact. Discussing the matter, they walked slowly back toward the ch_teau. They decided that since Braddock Washington had seen them together they had best depart the next night. Nevertheless, John's lips were unusually dry at dinner, and he nervously emptied a great spoonful of peacock soup into his left lung. He had to be carried VIII 19 into the turquoise and sable cardroom and pounded on the back by one of the underbutlers, which Percy considered a great joke. The Diamond as Big as the Ritz IX LONG AFTER midnight John's body gave a nervous jerk, and he sat suddenly upright, staring into the veils of somnolence that draped the room. Through the squares of blue darkness that were his open windows, he had heard a faint faraway sound that died upon a bed of wind before identifying itself on his memory, clouded with uneasy dreams. But the sharp noise that had succeeded it was nearer, was just outside the room(cid:20)the click of a turned knob, a footstep, a whisper, he could not tell; a hard lump gathered in the pit of his stomach, and his whole body ached in the moment that he strained agonizingly to hear. Then one of the veils seemed to dissolve, and he saw a vague figure standing by the door, a figure only faintly limned and blocked in upon the darkness, mingled so with the folds of the drapery as to seem distorted, like a reflection seen in a dirty pane of glass. With a sudden movement of fright or resolution John pressed the button by his bedside, and the next moment he was sitting in the green sunken bath of the adjoining room, waked into alertness by the shock of the cold water which half filled it. He sprang out, and, his wet pajamas scattering a heavy trickle of water behind him, ran for the aquamarine door which he knew led out onto the ivory landing of the second floor. The door opened noiselessly. A single crimson lamp burning in a great dome above lit the magnificent sweep of the carved stairways with a poignant beauty. For a moment John hesitated, appalled by the silent splendor massed about him, seeming to envelop in its gigantic folds and contours the solitary drenched little figure shivering upon the ivory landing. Then simultaneously two things happened. The door of his own sittingroom swung open, precipitating three naked negroes into the hall(cid:20)and, as John swayed in wild terror toward the stairway, another door slid back in the wall on the other side of the corridor, and John saw Braddock Washington standing in the lighted lift, wearing a fur coat and a pair of riding boots which reached to his knees and displayed, above, the glow of his rosecolored pajamas. On the",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),14,"instant the three negroes(cid:20)John had never seen any of them before, and it flashed through his mind that they must be the professional executioners(cid:20)paused in their movement toward John, and turned expectantly to the man in the lift, who burst out with an imperious command: ""Get in here! All three of you! Quick as hell!"" Then, within the instant, the three negroes darted into the cage, the oblong of light was blotted out as the lift door slid shut, and John was again alone in the hall. He slumped weakly down against an ivory stair. It was apparent that something portentous had occurred, something which, for the moment at least, had postponed his own petty disaster. What was it? Had the negroes risen in revolt? Had the aviators forced aside the iron bars of the grating? Or had the men of Fish stumbled blindly through the hills and gazed with bleak, joyless eyes upon the gaudy valley? John did not know. He heard a faint whir of air as the lift whizzed up again, and then, a moment later, as it descended. It was probable that Percy was hurrying to his father's assistance, and it occurred to John that this was his opportunity to join Kismine and plan an immediate escape. He waited until the lift had been silent for several minutes; shivering a little with the night cool that whipped in through his wet pajamas, he returned to his room and dressed himself quickly. Then he mounted a long flight of stairs and turned down the corridor carpeted with Russian sable which led to Kismine's suite. ""Oh, you did, did you?"" John's voice trembled with anger. ""I've heard about enough of this. If you haven't any more pride and decency than to have an affair with a fellow that you know isn't much better than a corpse, I don't want to have any more to do with you!""

On the instant the three negroesJohn had never seen any of them before, and it flashed through his mind that they must be the professional executionerspaused in their movement toward John, and turned expectantly to the man in the lift, who burst out with an imperious command: ""Get in here! All three of you! Quick as hell!"" Then, within the instant, the three negroes darted into the cage, the oblong of light was blotted out as the lift door slid shut, and John was again alone in the hall. He slumped weakly down against an ivory stair. It was apparent that something portentous had occurred, something which, for the moment at least, had postponed his own petty disaster. What was it? Had the negroes risen in revolt? Had the aviators forced aside the iron bars of the grating? Or had the men of Fish stumbled blindly through the hills and gazed with bleak, joyless eyes upon the gaudy valley? John did not know. He heard a faint whir of air as the lift whizzed up again, and then, a moment later, as it descended. It was probable that Percy was hurrying to his father's assistance, and it occurred to John that this was his opportunity to join Kismine and plan an immediate escape. He waited until the lift had been silent for several minutes; shivering a little with the night cool that whipped in through his wet pajamas, he returned to his room and dressed himself quickly. Then he mounted a long flight of stairs and turned down the corridor carpeted with Russian sable which led to Kismine's suite. The door of her sittingroom was open and the lamps were lighted. Kismine, in an angora kimono, stood near the window of the room in a listening attitude, and as John entered noiselessly she turned toward him. ""Oh, it's you!"" she whispered, crossing the room to him. ""Did you hear them?"" ""I heard your father's slaves in my"" ""No,"" she interrupted excitedly. ""Aeroplanes!"" ""Aeroplanes? Perhaps that was the sound that woke me."" ""There're at least a dozen. I saw one a few moments ago dead against the moon. The guard back by the cliff fired his rifle and that's what roused father. We're going to open on them right away."" ""Are they here on purpose?"" ""Yesit's that Italian who got away"" Simultaneously with her last word, a succession of sharp cracks tumbled in through the open window. Kismine uttered a little cry, took a penny with fumbling fingers from a box on her dresser, and ran to one of the IX 22 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz electric lights. In an instant the entire ch_teau was in darknessshe",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),16,"had blown out the fuse. ""Come on!"" she cried to him. ""We'll go up to the roof garden, and watch it from there!"" Drawing a cape about her, she took his hand, and they found their way out the door. It was only a step to the tower lift, and as she pressed the button that shot them upward he put his arms around her in the darkness and kissed her mouth. Romance had come to John Unger at last. A minute later they had stepped out upon the starwhite platform. Above, under the misty moon, sliding in and out of the patches of cloud that eddied below it, floated a dozen darkwinged bodies in a constant circling course. From here and there in the valley flashes of fire leaped toward them, followed by sharp detonations. Kismine clapped her hands with pleasure, which, a moment later, turned to dismay as the aeroplanes at some prearranged signal, began to release their bombs and the whole of the valley became a panorama of deep reverberate sound and lurid light. Before long the aim of the attackers became concentrated upon the points where the antiaircraft guns were situated, and one of them was almost immediately reduced to a giant cinder to lie smouldering in a park of rose bushes. ""Kismine,"" begged John, ""you'll be glad when I tell you that this attack came on the eve of my murder. If I hadn't heard that guard shoot off his gun back by the pass I should now be stone dead"" ""I can't hear you!"" cried Kismine, intent on the scene before her. ""You'll have to talk louder!"" ""I simply said, "" shouted John, ""that we'd better get out before they begin to shell the ch_teau!"" Suddenly the whole portico of the negro quarters cracked asunder, a geyser of flame shot up from under the colonnades, and great fragments of jagged marble were hurled as far as the borders of the lake. ""There go fifty thousand dollars' worth of slaves,"" cried Kismine, ""at prewar prices. So few Americans have any respect for property."" John renewed his efforts to compel her to leave. The aim of the aeroplanes was becoming more precise minute by minute, and only two of the antiaircraft guns were still retaliating. It was obvious that the garrison, encircled with fire, could not hold out much longer. ""Come on!"" cried John, pulling Kismine's arm, ""we've got to go. Do you realize that those aviators will kill you without question if they find you ?"" She consented reluctantly. ""We'll have to wake Jasmine!"" she said, as they hurried toward the lift. Then she added in a sort of childish delight: ""We'll be poor, won't we? Like people in books. And I'll be an orphan and utterly free. Free and poor! What fun!"" She stopped and raised her lips to him in a delighted kiss. ""It's impossible to be both together,"" said John grimly. ""People have found that out. And I should choose to be free as preferable of the two. As an extra caution you'd better dump the contents of your jewel box into your pockets."" Ten minutes later the two girls met John in the dark corridor and they descended to the main floor of the ch_teau. Passing for the last time through the magnificence of the splendid halls, they stood for a moment out on the terrace, watching the burning negro quarters and the flaming embers of two planes which had fallen on the other side of the lake. A solitary gun was still keeping up a sturdy popping, and the attackers seemed timorous about descending lower, but sent their thunderous fireworks in a circle around it, until any chance shot might annihilate its Ethiopian crew. John and the two sisters passed down the marble steps, turned sharply to the left, and began to ascend a narrow path that wound like a garter about the diamond mountain. Kismine knew a heavily wooded spot halfway up where they could lie concealed and yet be able to observe the wild night in the valleyfinally to make an escape, when it should be necessary, along a secret path laid in a rocky gully. IX 23 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz X IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK when they attained their destination. The obliging and phlegmatic Jasmine fell off to sleep immediately, leaning against the trunk of a large tree, while John and Kismine sat, his arm around her, and watched the desperate ebb and flow of the dying battle among the ruins of a vista that had been a garden spot that morning. Shortly after four o'clock the last remaining gun gave out a clanging sound and went out of action in a swift tongue of red smoke. Though the moon was down, they",no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),17,"saw that the flying bodies were circling closer to the earth. When the planes had made certain that the beleaguered possessed no further resources, they would land and the dark and glittering reign of the Washingtons would be over. With the cessation of the firing the valley grew quiet. The embers of the two aeroplanes glowed like the eyes of some monster crouching in the grass. The ch_teau stood dark and silent, beautiful without light as it had been beautiful in the sun, while the woody rattles of Nemesis filled the air above with a growing and receding complaint. Then John perceived that Kismine, like her sister, had fallen sound asleep. It was long after four when he became aware of footsteps along the path they had lately followed, and he waited in breathless silence until the persons to whom they belonged had passed the vantagepoint he occupied. There was a faint stir in the air now that was not of human origin, and the dew was cold; he knew that the dawn would break soon. John waited until the steps had gone a safe distance up the mountain and were inaudible. Then he followed. About halfway to the steep summit the trees fell away and a hard saddle of rock spread itself over the diamond beneath. Just before he reached this point he slowed down his pace, warned by an animal sense that there was life just ahead of him. Coming to a high boulder, he lifted his head gradually above its edge. His curiosity was rewarded; this is what he saw: Braddock Washington was standing there motionless, silhouetted against the gray sky without sound or sign of life. As the dawn came up out of the east, lending a cold green color to the earth, it brought the solitary figure into insignificant contrast with the new day. While John watched, his host remained for a few moments absorbed in some inscrutable contemplation; then he signalled to the two negroes who crouched at his feet to lift the burden which lay between them. As they struggled upright, the first yellow beam of the sun struck through the innumerable prisms of an immense and exquisitely chiselled diamondand a white radiance was kindled that glowed upon the air like a fragment of the morning star. The bearers staggered beneath its weight for a momentthen their rippling muscles caught and hardened under the wet shine of the skins and the three figures were again motionless in their defiant impotency before the heavens. After a while the white man lifted his head and slowly raised his arms in a gesture of attention, as one who would call a great crowd to hearbut there was no crowd, only the vast silence of the mountain and the sky, broken by faint bird voices down among the trees. The figure on the saddle of rock began to speak ponderously and with an inextinguishable pride. ""You out there"" he cried in a trembling voice. ""You there!"" He paused, his arms still uplifted, his head held attentively as though he were expecting an answer. John strained his eyes to see whether there might be men coming down the mountain, but the mountain was bare of human life. There was only sky and a mocking flute of wind along the treetops. Could Washington be praying? For a moment John wondered. Then the illusion passedthere was something in the man's whole attitude antithetical to prayer. ""Oh, you above there!"" The voice was become strong and confident. This was no forlorn supplication. If anything, there was in it a quality of monstrous condescension. ""You there"" Words, too quickly uttered to be understood, flowing one into the other. . . . John listened breathlessly, catching a phrase here and there, while the voice broke off, resumed, broke off againnow strong and argumentative, now colored with a slow, puzzled impatience. Then a conviction commenced to dawn on the single listener, and as realization crept over him a spray of quick blood rushed through his arteries. Braddock Washington was offering a bribe to God! That was itthere was no doubt. The diamond in the arms of his slaves was some advance sample, a promise X 24 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz of more to follow. That, John perceived after a time, was the thread running through his sentences. Prometheus Enriched was calling to witness forgotten sacrifices, forgotten rituals, prayers obsolete before the birth of Christ. For a while his discourse took the form of reminding God of this gift or that which Divinity had deigned to accept from mengreat churches if he would rescue cities from the plague, gifts of myrrh and gold, of human lives and beautiful women and captive armies, of children and queens, of beasts of the forest and",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),18,"field, sheep and goats, harvests and cities, whole conquered lands that had been offered up in lust or blood for His appeasal, buying a meed's worth of alleviation from the Divine wrathand now he, Braddock Washington, Emperor of Diamonds, king and priest of the age of gold, arbiter of splendor and luxury, would offer up a treasure such as princes before him had never dreamed of, offer it up not in suppliance, but in pride. He would give to God, he continued, getting down to specifications, the greatest diamond in the world. This diamond would be cut with many more thousand facets than there were leaves on a tree, and yet the whole diamond would be shaped with the perfection of a stone no bigger than a fly. Many men would work upon it for many years. It would be set in a great dome of beaten gold, wonderfully carved and equipped with gates of opal and crusted sapphire. In the middle would be hollowed out a chapel presided over by an altar of iridescent, decomposing, everchanging radium which would burn out the eyes of any worshipper who lifted up his head from prayerand on this altar there would be slain for the amusement of the Divine Benefactor any victim He should choose, even though it should be the greatest and most powerful man alive. In return he asked only a simple thing, a thing that for God would be absurdly easyonly that matters should be as they were yesterday at this hour and that they should so remain. So very simple! Let but the heavens open, swallowing these men and their aeroplanesand then close again. Let him have his slaves once more, restored to life and well. There was no one else with whom he had ever needed to treat or bargain. He doubted only whether he had made his bribe big enough. God had His price, of course. God was made in man's image, so it had been said: He must have His price. And the price would be rareno cathedral whose building consumed many years, no pyramid constructed by ten thousand workmen, would be like this cathedral, this pyramid. He paused here. That was his proposition. Everything would be up to specifications and there was nothing vulgar in his assertion that it would be cheap at the price. He implied that Providence could take it or leave it. As he approached the end his sentences became broken, became short and uncertain, and his body seemed tense, seemed strained to catch the slightest pressure or whisper of life in the spaces around him. His hair had turned gradually white as he talked, and now he lifted his head high to the heavens like a prophet of oldmagnificently mad. Then, as John stared in giddy fascination, it seemed to him that a curious phenomenon took place somewhere around him. It was as though the sky had darkened for an instant, as though there had been a sudden murmur in a gust of wind, a sound of faraway trumpets, a sighing like the rustle of a great silken robefor a time the whole of nature round about partook of this darkness; the birds' song ceased; the trees were still, and far over the mountain there was a mutter of dull, menacing thunder. That was all. The wind died along the tall grasses of the valley. The dawn and the day resumed their place in a time, and the risen sun sent hot waves of yellow mist that made its path bright before it. The leaves laughed in the sun, and their laughter shook the trees until each bough was like a girl's school in fairyland. God had refused to accept the bribe. For another moment John watched the triumph of the day. Then, turning he saw a flutter of brown down by the lake, then another flutter, then another, like the dance of golden angels alighting from the clouds. The aeroplanes had come to earth. John slid off the boulder and ran down the side of the mountain to the clump of trees, where the two girls were awake and waiting for him. Kismine sprang to her feet, the jewels in her pockets jingling, a question on her parted lips, but instinct told John that there was no time for words. They must get off the mountain without losing a moment. He seized a hand of each and in silence they threaded the treetrunks, washed with light now and with the rising mist. Behind them from the valley came no sound at all, except the complaint of the peacocks far away and the pleasant undertone of morning. X 25 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz When they had gone about half a mile, they avoided the park land and",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),19,"entered a narrow path that led over the next rise of ground. At the highest point of this they paused and turned around. Their eyes rested upon the mountainside they had just leftoppressed by some dark sense of tragic impendency. Clear against the sky a broken, whitehaired man was slowly descending the steep slope, followed by two gigantic and emotionless negroes, who carried a burden between them which still flashed and glittered in the sun. Halfway down two other figures joined themJohn could see that they were Mrs. Washington and her son, upon whose arm she leaned. The aviators had clambered from their machines to the sweeping lawn in front of the ch_teau, and with rifles in hand were starting up the diamond mountain in skirmishing formation. But the little group of five which had formed farther up and was engrossing all the watchers' attention had stopped upon a ledge of rock. The negroes stooped and pulled up what appeared to be a trapdoor in the side of the mountain. Into this they all disappeared, the whitehaired man first, then his wife and son, finally the two negroes, the glittering tips of whose jeweled headdresses caught the sun for a moment before the trapdoor descended and engulfed them all. Kismine clutched John's arm. ""Oh,"" she cried wildly, ""where are they going? What are they going to do?"" ""It must be some underground way of escape "" A little scream from the two girls interrupted his sentence. ""Don't you see?"" sobbed Kismine hysterically. ""The mountain is wired!"" Even as she spoke John put up his hands to shield his sight. Before their eyes the whole surface of the mountain had changed suddenly to a dazzling burning yellow, which showed up through the jacket of turf as light shows through a human hand. For a moment the intolerable glow continued, and then like an extinguished filament it disappeared, revealing a black waste from which blue smoke arose slowly, carrying off with it what remained of vegetation and of human flesh. Of the aviators there was left neither blood, nor bonethey were consumed as completely as the five souls who had gone inside. Simultaneously, and with an immense concussion, the ch_teau literally threw itself into the air, bursting into flaming fragments as it rose, and then tumbling back upon itself in a smoking pile that lay projecting half into the water of the lake. There was no firewhat smoke there was drifted off mingling with the sunshine, and for a few minutes longer a powdery dust of marble drifted from the great featureless pile that had once been the house of jewels. There was no more sound and the three people were alone in the valley. X 26 The Diamond as Big as the Ritz XI AT SUNSET John and his two companions reached the high cliff which had marked the boundaries of the Washingtons' dominion, and looking back found the valley tranquil and lovely in the dusk. They sat down to finish the food which Jasmine had brought with her in a basket. ""There!"" she said, as she spread the tablecloth and put the sandwiches in a neat pile upon it. ""Don't they look tempting? I always think that food tastes better outdoors."" ""With that remark,"" remarked Kismine, ""Jasmine enters the middle class."" ""Now,"" said John eagerly, ""turn out your pocket and let's see what jewels you brought along. If you made a good selection we three ought to live comfortably all the rest of our lives."" Obediently Kismine put her hand in her pocket and tossed two handfuls of glittering stones before him. ""Not so bad,"" cried John, enthusiastically. ""They aren't very big, but Hello!"" His expression changed as he held one of them up to the declining sun. ""Why, these aren't diamonds! There's something the matter!"" ""By golly!"" exclaimed Kismine, with a startled look. ""What an idiot I am!"" ""Why, these are rhinestones!"" cried John. ""I know."" She broke into a laugh. ""I opened the wrong drawer. They belonged on the dress of a girl who visited Jasmine. I got her to give them to me in exchange for diamonds. I'd never seen anything but precious stones before."" ""And this is what you brought?"" ""I'm afraid so."" She fingered the brilliants wistfully. ""I think I like these better. I'm a little tired of diamonds."" ""Very well,"" said John gloomily. ""We'll have to live in Hades. And you will grow old telling incredulous women that you got the wrong drawer. Unfortunately your father's bankbooks were consumed with him."" ""Well, what's the matter with Hades?"" ""If I come home with a wife at my age my father is just as liable as not to cut me off with a hot coal, as they say down there."" Jasmine spoke up. ""I love washing,""",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Diamond As Big As the Ritz -- F. Scott Fitzgerald -- ( WeLib.org ),20,"she said quietly. ""I have always washed my own handkerchiefs. I'll take in laundry and support you both."" ""Do they have washwomen in Hades?"" asked Kismine innocently. ""Of course,"" answered John. ""It's just like anywhere else."" ""I thoughtperhaps it was too hot to wear any clothes."" John laughed. ""Just try it!"" he suggested. ""They'll run you out before you're half started."" ""Will father be there?"" she asked. John turned to her in astonishment. ""Your father is dead,"" he replied somberly. ""Why should he go to Hades? You have it confused with another place that was abolished long ago."" After supper they folded up the tablecloth and spread their blankets for the night. ""What a dream it was,"" Kismine sighed, gazing up at the stars. ""How strange it seems to be here with one dress and a penniless fianc_! ""Under the stars,"" she repeated. ""I never noticed the stars before. I always thought of them as great big diamonds that belonged to some one. Now they frighten me. They make me feel that it was all a dream, all my youth."" ""It was a dream,"" said John quietly. ""Everybody's youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness."" ""How pleasant then to be insane!"" ""So I'm told,"" said John gloomily. ""I don't know any longer. At any rate, let us love for a while, for a year or so, you and me. That's a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only diamonds in the whole world, diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of disillusion. Well, I have that last and I will make the usual nothing of it."" He shivered. ""Turn up your coat collar, little girl, the night's full of chill and you'll get pneumonia. His was a great sin who first invented consciousness. Let us lose it for a few hours."" XI 27 So wrapping himself in his blanket he fell off to sleep. The Diamond as Big as the Ritz XI 28",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes

I The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide. The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth. The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom. Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea. Besides holding our 3 4 HEART OF DARKNESS hearts together through long periods of separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each others yarnsand even convictions. The Lawyerthe best of old fellowshad, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The Director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun. And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat, as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men. Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound. The JOSEPH CONRAD 5 old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes, followed the sea with reverence and affection, than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea. It had known and served all the",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Heart_Darkness,1,"men of whom the nation is proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled and untitledthe great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from the Golden Hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure, to be visited by the Queens Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale, to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquestsand that never returned. It had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from Deptford, from Eriththe adventurers and the settlers; kings ships and the ships of men on Change; captains, admirals, the dark the the Eastern interlopers of commissioned generals of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the sacred fire. What greatness had not from Greenwich, trade, and 6 HEART OF DARKNESS floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth! . . . The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires. The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear along the shore. The Chapman lighthouse, a three-legged thing erect on a mud-flat, shone strongly. Lights of ships moved in the fairway a great stir of lights going up and going down. And farther west on the upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars. And this also, said Marlow suddenly, has been one of the dark places of the earth. He was the only man of us who still followed the sea. The worst that could be said of him was that he did not represent his class. He was a seaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may so express it, a sedentary life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home order, and their home is always with themthe ship; and so is their countrythe sea. One ship is very much like another, and the sea is always the same. In the immutability of their surroundings the the changing the foreign faces, foreign shores, immensity of life, glide past, veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance; for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself, which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny. For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent, and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing. The yarns of seamen have a direct simplicity, the whole JOSEPH CONRAD 7 meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine. His remark did not seem at all surprising. It was just like Marlow. It was accepted in silence. No one took the trouble to grunt even; and presently he said, very slow I was thinking of very old times, when the Romans first came here, nineteen hundred years ago the other day. . . . Light came out of this river since you say Knights? Yes; but it is like a running blaze on a plain, like a flash of lightning in the clouds. We live in the flickermay it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling! But darkness was here yesterday. Imagine the feelings of a commander of a finewhat dye call em?trireme in the Mediterranean, ordered suddenly to the north; run overland across the Gauls in a hurry; put in charge of one of these craft the legionariesa wonderful lot of handy men they must have been, tooused to build, apparently by the hundred, in a month or two, if we may believe what we read. Imagine him herethe very end of the world, a sea the colour of lead, a sky the colour of smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertinaand going up this river with stores, or orders, or what you like.

They must have been dying like flies here. Oh, yeshe did it. Did it very well, too, no doubt, and without thinking much about it either, except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time, perhaps. They were men enough to face the darkness. And perhaps he was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at Ravenna by and by, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful climate. Or think of a decent young citizen in a togaperhaps too much dice, you know coming out here in the train of some prefect, or tax- gatherer, or trader even, to mend his fortunes.

The fascination of the abominationyou know, imagine the growing regrets, the longing to escape, the powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate. He paused. Mind, he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of the hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a lotus- flowerMind, none of us would feel exactly like this. What saves us is efficiencythe devotion to JOSEPH CONRAD 9 efficiency. But these chaps were not much account, really. They were no colonists; their administration was merely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect. They were conquerors, and for that you want only brute forcenothing to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others. They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and men going at it blindas is very proper for those who tackle a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not a sentimental pretence but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the ideasomething you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a sacrifice to. . . . joining, crossing He broke off. Flames glided in the river, small green flames, red flames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking, each otherthen separating slowly or hastily. The traffic of the great city went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river. We looked on, waiting patientlythere was nothing else to do till the end of the flood; but it was only after a long silence, when he said, in a hesitating voice, I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn fresh-water sailor for a bit, that we knew we were fated, before the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlows inconclusive experiences. I dont want to bother you much with what happened to me personally, he began, showing in this 10 HEART OF DARKNESS remark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem so often unaware of what their audience would best like to hear; yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I got out there, what I saw, how I went up that river to the place where I first met the poor chap. It was the farthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience. It seemed somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about meand into my thoughts. It was sombre enough, tooand pitifulnot extraordinary in any waynot very clear either. No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light. I had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seasa regular dose of the Eastsix years or so, and I was loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes, just as though I had got a heavenly mission to civilize you. It was very fine for a time, but after a bit I",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,3,"did get tired of resting. Then I began to look for a shipI should think the hardest work on earth. But the ships wouldnt even look at me. And I got tired of that game, too. Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on the earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map (but they all look that) I would put my finger on it and say, When I grow up I will go there. The North Pole was one of these places, I remember. Well, I havent been there yet, and shall not try now. The glamours off. Other places were scattered about the Equator, and in every sort of JOSEPH CONRAD 11 latitude all over the two hemispheres. I have been in some of them, and . . . well, we wont talk about that. But there was one yetthe biggest, the most blank, so to speakthat I had a hankering after. True, by this time it was not a blank space any more. It had got filled since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names. It had ceased to be a blank space of delightful mysterya white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over. It had become a place of darkness. But there was in it one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the depths of the land. And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window, it fascinated me as a snake would a birda silly little bird. Then I remembered there was a big concern, a Company for trade on that river. Dash it all! I thought to myself, they cant trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh watersteamboats! Why shouldnt I try to get charge of one? I went on along Fleet Street, but could not shake off the idea. The snake had charmed me. You understand it was a Continental concern, that Trading society; but I have a lot of relations living on the Continent, because its cheap and not so nasty as it looks, they say. I am sorry to own I began to worry them. This was already a fresh departure for me. I was not used to get things that way, you know. I always went my own road and on my own legs where I had a mind to go. I wouldnt have believed it of myself; but, thenyou seeI felt somehow I must get there by hook or by 12 HEART OF DARKNESS crook. So I worried them. The men said My dear fellow, and did nothing. Thenwould you believe it?I tried the women. I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to workto get a job. Heavens! Well, you see, the notion drove me. I had an aunt, a dear enthusiastic soul. She wrote: It will be delightful. I am ready to do anything, anything for you. It is a glorious idea. I know the wife of a very high personage the Administration, and also a man who has lots of influence with, etc., etc. She was determined to make no end of fuss to get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy. in I got my appointmentof course; and I got it very quick. It appears the Company had received news that one of their captains had been killed in a scuffle with the natives. This was my chance, and it made me the more anxious to go. It was only months and months afterwards, when I made the attempt to recover what was left of the body, that I heard the original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens. Yes, two black hens. Fresleventhat was the fellows name, a Danethought himself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went ashore and started to hammer the chief of the village with a stick. Oh, it didnt surprise me in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told that Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two legs. No doubt he was; but he had been a couple of years already out there engaged in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the need at last of asserting his self- respect in some way. Therefore he whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of his people watched him,",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,4,"thunderstruck, till some manI was told JOSEPH CONRAD 13 the other hand, the chiefs sonin desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab with a spear at the white manand of course it went quite easy between the shoulder-blades. Then the whole population cleared into the forest, expecting all kinds of calamities to the steamer happen, while, on Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic, in charge of the engineer, I believe. Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much about Freslevens remains, till I got out and stepped into his shoes. I couldnt let it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last to meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough to hide his bones. They were all there. The supernatural being had not been touched after he fell. And the village was deserted, the huts gaped black, rotting, all askew within the fallen enclosures. A calamity had come to it, sure enough. The people had vanished. Mad terror had scattered them, men, women, and children, through the bush, and they had never returned. What became of the hens I dont know either. I should think the cause of progress got them, anyhow. However, through this glorious affair I got my appointment, before I had fairly begun to hope for it. I flew around like mad to get ready, and before forty-eight hours I was crossing the Channel to show myself to my employers, and sign the contract. In a very few hours I arrived in a city that always makes me think of a whited sepulchre. Prejudice no doubt. I had no difficulty in finding the Companys offices. It was the biggest thing in the town, and everybody I met was full of it. They were going to run an over-sea empire, and make no end of coin by trade. 14 HEART OF DARKNESS A narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high houses, innumerable windows with venetian blinds, a dead silence, grass sprouting between the stones, imposing carriage archways right and left, immense double doors standing ponderously ajar. I slipped through one of these cracks, went up a swept and ungarnished staircase, as arid as a desert, and opened the first door I came to. Two women, one fat and the other slim, sat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool. The slim one got up and walked straight at mestill knitting with downcast eyesand only just as I began to think of getting out of her way, as you would for a somnambulist, stood still, and looked up. Her dress was as plain as an umbrella- cover, and she turned round without a word and preceded me into a waiting-room. I gave my name, and looked about. Deal table in the middle, plain chairs all round the walls, on one end a large shining map, marked with all the colours of a rainbow. There was a vast amount of redgood to see at any time, because one knows that some real work is done in there, a deuce of a lot of blue, a little green, smears of orange, and, on the East Coast, a purple patch, to show where the jolly pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager-beer. However, I wasnt going into any of these. I was going into the yellow. Dead in the centre. And the river was therefascinatingdeadlylike a snake. Ough! A door opened, a white-haired secretarial head, but wearing a compassionate expression, appeared, and a skinny forefinger beckoned me into the sanctuary. Its light was dim, and a heavy writing-desk squatted in the middle. From behind that structure came out an impression of pale plumpness in a frock-coat. The JOSEPH CONRAD 15 great man himself. He was five feet six, I should judge, and had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many millions. He shook hands, I fancy, murmured vaguely, was satisfied with my French. Bon voyage. In about forty-five seconds I found myself again in the waiting-room with the compassionate secretary, who, full of desolation and sympathy, made me sign some document. I believe I undertook amongst other things not to disclose any trade secrets. Well, I am not going to. I began to feel slightly uneasy. You know I am not used to such ceremonies, and there was something ominous in the atmosphere. It was just as though I had been let into some conspiracyI dont know something not quite right; and I was glad to get out. In the outer room the two women knitted black wool feverishly. People were arriving, and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them. The old one sat on her chair. Her flat cloth slippers were propped up on a foot-warmer, and a cat reposed on her lap. She wore a",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Heart_Darkness,5,"starched white affair on her head, had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed spectacles hung on the tip of her nose. She glanced at me above the glasses. The swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me. Two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over, and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom. She seemed to know all about them and about me, too. An eerie feeling came over me. She seemed uncanny and fateful. Often far away there I thought of these two, guarding the door of Darkness, knitting black wool as for a warm pall, one introducing, introducing continuously to the unknown, the other scrutinizing the 16 HEART OF DARKNESS cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes. Ave! Old knitter of black wool. Morituri te salutant. Not many of those she looked at ever saw her again not half, by a long way. There was yet a visit to the doctor. A simple formality, assured me the secretary, with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows. Accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow, some clerk I supposethere must have been clerks in the business, though the house was as still as a house in a city of the deadcame from somewhere up-stairs, and led me forth. He was shabby and careless, with ink-stains on the sleeves of his jacket, and his cravat was large and billowy, under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot. It was a little too early for the doctor, so I proposed a drink, and thereupon he developed a vein of joviality. As we sat over our vermouths he glorified the Companys business, and by and by I expressed casually my surprise at him not going out there. He became very cool and collected all at once. I am not such a fool as I look, quoth Plato to his disciples, he said sententiously, emptied his glass with great resolution, and we rose. The old doctor felt my pulse, evidently thinking of something else the while. Good, good for there, he mumbled, and then with a certain eagerness asked me whether I would let him measure my head. Rather surprised, I said Yes, when he produced a thing like calipers and got the dimensions back and front and every way, taking notes carefully. He was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine, with his feet in slippers, and I thought him a harmless fool. I always ask leave, in the interests of science, to JOSEPH CONRAD 17 measure the crania of those going out there, he said. And when they come back, too? I asked. Oh, I never see them, he remarked; and, moreover, the changes take place inside, you know. He smiled, as if at some quiet joke. So you are going out there. Famous. Interesting, too. He gave me a searching glance, and made another note. Ever any madness in your family? he asked, in a matter-of-fact tone. I felt very annoyed. Is that question in the interests of science, too? It would be, he said, without taking notice of my irritation, interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals, on the spot, but . . . Are you an alienist? I interrupted. Every doctor should bea that original, imperturbably. I have a little theory which you Messieurs who go out there must help me to prove. This is my share in the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a magnificent dependency. The mere wealth I leave to others. Pardon my questions, but you are the first Englishman coming under my observation . . . I hastened to assure him I was not in the least typical. If I were, said I, I wouldnt be talking like this with you. What you say is rather profound, and probably erroneous, he said, with a laugh. Avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun. Adieu. How do you English say, eh? Good- bye. Ah! Good-bye. Adieu. In the tropics one must before everything keep calm. . . . He lifted a warning forefinger. . . . Du calme, du calme. Adieu. answered little, One thing more remained to dosay good-bye to my excellent aunt. I found her triumphant. I had a cup of teathe last decent cup of tea for many days and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you 18 HEART OF DARKNESS would expect a ladys drawing-room to look, we had a long quiet chat by the fireside. In the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me I had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary, and goodness knows to how many more",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,6,"people besides, as an exceptional and gifted creaturea piece of good fortune for the Companya man you dont get hold of every day. Good heavens! and I was going to take charge of a two-penny-half-penny river-steamboat with a penny whistle attached! It appeared, however, I was also one of the Workers, with a capitalyou know. Something like an emissary of light, something like a lower sort of apostle. There had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk just about that time, and the excellent woman, living right in the rush of all that humbug, got carried off her feet. She talked about weaning those ignorant millions from their horrid ways, till, upon my word, she made me quite uncomfortable. I ventured to hint that the Company was run for profit. You forget, dear Charlie, that the labourer is worthy of his hire, she said, brightly. Its queer how out of touch with truth women are. They live in a world of their own, and there has never been anything like it, and never can be. It is too beautiful altogether, and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset. Some confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over. After this I got embraced, told to wear flannel, be sure to write often, and so onand I left. In the streetI dont know whya queer feeling came to me JOSEPH CONRAD 19 that I was an impostor. Odd thing that I, who used to clear out for any part of the world at twenty-four hours notice, with less thought than most men give to the crossing of a street, had a momentI wont say of hesitation, but of this commonplace affair. The best way I can explain it to you is by saying that, for a second or two, I felt as though, instead of going to the centre of a continent, I were about to set off for the centre of the earth. startled pause, before I left in a French steamer, and she called in every blamed port they have out there, for, as far as I could see, the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom- house officers. I watched the coast. Watching a coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma. There it is before yousmiling, frowning, inviting, grand, mean, insipid, or savage, and always mute with an air of whispering, Come and find out. This one was almost featureless, as if still in the making, with an aspect of monotonous grimness. The edge of a colossal jungle, so dark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran straight, like a ruled line, far, far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist. The sun was fierce, the land seemed to glisten and drip with steam. Here and there greyish- whitish specks showed up clustered inside the white surf, with a them perhaps. Settlements some centuries old, and still no bigger than their pinheads on background. We pounded along, stopped, landed soldiers; went on, landed custom-house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness, with a tin shed and a flag-pole lost in it; landed more soldiersto take care of the custom-house clerks, the untouched expanse of flying above flag 20 HEART OF DARKNESS languid sea, the oily and presumably. Some, I heard, got drowned in the surf; they did or not, nobody seemed but whether particularly to care. They were just flung out there, and on we went. Every day the coast looked the same, as though we had not moved; but we passed various like Gran placestrading placeswith names Bassam, Little Popo; names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister back- cloth. The idleness of a passenger, my isolation amongst all these men with whom I had no point of contact, the uniform sombreness of the coast, seemed to keep me away from the truth of things, within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion. The voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure, like the speech of a brother. It was something natural, that had its reason, that had a meaning. Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact with reality. It was paddled by black fellows. You could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening. They shouted, sang; their bodies streamed with perspiration; they had faces like grotesque masksthese chaps; but they had bone, muscle, a wild vitality, an intense energy of movement, that was as natural and true as",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,7,"the surf along their coast. They wanted no excuse for being there. They were a great comfort to look at. For a time I would feel I belonged still to a world of straightforward facts; but the feeling would not last long. Something would turn up to scare it away. Once, I remember, we came upon a man-of-war anchored off the coast. There wasnt even a shed there, and she was shelling the bush. It appears the French had one of their wars going on thereabouts. Her ensign dropped JOSEPH CONRAD 21 in insanity touch of incomprehensible, firing limp like a rag; the muzzles of the long six-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull; the greasy, slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down, swaying her thin masts. In the empty immensity of earth, sky, and water, there she was, into a continent. Pop, would go one of the six-inch guns; a small flame would dart and vanish, a little white smoke would disappear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble screechand nothing happened. Nothing could the happen. There was a proceeding, a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight; and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was a camp of nativeshe called them enemies!hidden out of sight somewhere. We gave her her letters (I heard the men in that lonely ship were dying of fever at the rate of three a day) and went on. We called at some more places with farcical names, where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb; all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf, as if Nature herself had tried to ward off intruders; in and out of rivers, streams of death in life, whose banks were rotting into mud, whose waters, thickened into slime, invaded the contorted mangroves, that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair. Nowhere did we stop long enough to get a particularized impression, but the general sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me. It was like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares. It was upward of thirty days before I saw the mouth of the big river. We anchored off the seat of the government. But my work would not begin till some 22 HEART OF DARKNESS two hundred miles farther on. So as soon as I could I made a start for a place thirty miles higher up. I had my passage on a little sea-going steamer. Her captain was a Swede, and knowing me for a seaman, invited me on the bridge. He was a young man, lean, fair, and morose, with lanky hair and a shuffling gait. As we left the miserable little wharf, he tossed his head contemptuously at the shore. Been living there? he asked. I said, Yes. Fine lot these they not? he went on, government chapsare speaking English with great precision and considerable bitterness. It is funny what some people will do for a few francs a month. I wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes upcountry? I said to him I expected to see that soon. So-o-o! he exclaimed. He shuffled athwart, keeping one eye ahead vigilantly. Dont be too sure, he continued. The other day I took up a man who hanged himself on the road. He was a Swede, too. Hanged himself! Why, in Gods name? I cried. He kept on looking out watchfully. Who knows? The sun too much for him, or the country perhaps. At last we opened a reach. A rocky cliff appeared, mounds of turned-up earth by the shore, houses on a hill, others with iron roofs, amongst a waste of excavations, or hanging to the declivity. A continuous noise of the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation. A lot of people, mostly black and naked, moved about like ants. A jetty projected into the river. A blinding sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden recrudescence of glare. Theres your Companys station, said the Swede, pointing to three wooden barrack-like structures on the JOSEPH CONRAD 23 rocky slope. I will send your things up. Four boxes did you say? So. Farewell. I came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass, then found a path leading up the hill. It turned aside for the boulders, and also for an undersized railway-truck lying there on its back with its wheels in the air. One was off. The thing looked as dead as the carcass of some animal. I came upon more pieces of decaying machinery, a stack of rusty rails. To the left a clump of trees made a shady spot, where dark things seemed to stir",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,8,"feebly. I blinked, the path was steep. A horn tooted to the right, and I saw the black people run. A heavy and dull detonation shook the ground, a puff of smoke came out of the cliff, and that was all. No change appeared on the face of the rock. They were building a railway. The cliff was not in the way or anything; but this objectless blasting was all the work going on. A slight clinking behind me made me turn my head. Six black men advanced in a file, toiling up the path. They walked erect and slow, balancing small baskets full of earth on their heads, and the clink kept time with their footsteps. Black rags were wound round their loins, and the short ends behind waggled to and fro like tails. I could see every rib, the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope; each had an iron collar on his neck, and all were connected together with a chain whose bights swung between them, rhythmically clinking. Another report from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war I had seen firing into a continent. It was the same kind of ominous these men could by no stretch of voice; but imagination be called enemies. They were called criminals, and the outraged law, like the bursting 24 HEART OF DARKNESS shells, had come to them, an insoluble mystery from the sea. All their meagre breasts panted together, the violently dilated nostrils quivered, the eyes stared stonily uphill. They passed me within six inches, without a glance, with that complete, deathlike indifference of unhappy savages. Behind this raw matter one of the reclaimed, the product of the new forces at work, strolled despondently, carrying a rifle by its middle. He had a uniform jacket with one button off, and seeing a white man on the path, hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity. This was simple prudence, white men being so much alike at a distance that he could not tell who I might be. He was speedily reassured, and with a large, white, rascally grin, and a glance at his charge, seemed into partnership in his exalted trust. After all, I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings. take me to Instead of going up, I turned and descended to the left. My idea was to let that chain-gang get out of sight before I climbed the hill. You know I am not particularly tender; Ive had to strike and to fend off. Ive had to resist and to attack sometimesthats only one way of resistingwithout counting the exact cost, according to the demands of such sort of life as I had blundered into. Ive seen the devil of violence, and the devil of greed, and the devil of hot desire; but, by all the stars! these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that swayed and drove menmen, I tell you. But as I stood on this hillside, I foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land I would become acquainted with a flabby, pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly. How insidious he could be, too, I was only to JOSEPH CONRAD 25 find out several months later and a thousand miles farther. For a moment I stood appalled, as though by a warning. Finally I descended the hill, obliquely, towards the trees I had seen. I avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the slope, the purpose of which I found it impossible to divine. It wasnt a quarry or a sandpit, anyhow. It was just a hole. It might have been connected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals something to do. I dont know. Then I nearly fell into a very narrow ravine, almost no more than a scar in the hillside. I discovered that a lot of imported drainage-pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in there. There wasnt one that was not broken. It was a wanton smash-up. At last I got under the trees. My purpose was to stroll into the shade for a moment; but no sooner within than it seemed to me I had stepped into the gloomy circle of some Inferno. The rapids were near, and an uninterrupted, uniform, headlong, rushing noise filled the mournful stillness of the grove, where not a breath stirred, not a leaf moved, with a mysterious soundas though the tearing pace of the launched earth had suddenly become audible. Black shapes crouched, lay, sat between the trees leaning against the trunks, clinging to the earth, half coming out, half effaced within the dim light, in all the attitudes of pain, abandonment, and despair. Another mine on the cliff went off, followed",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,9,"by a slight shudder of the soil under my feet. The work was going on. The work! And this was the place where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die. They were dying slowlyit was very clear. They were not enemies, they were not criminals, they 26 HEART OF DARKNESS were nothing earthly nownothing but black shadows of disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish gloom. Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality of time contracts, lost in uncongenial surroundings, fed on unfamiliar food, they sickened, became inefficient, and were then allowed to crawl away and rest. These moribund shapes were free as airand nearly as thin. I began to distinguish the gleam of the eyes under the trees. Then, glancing down, I saw a face near my hand. The black bones reclined at full length with one shoulder against the tree, and slowly the eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me, enormous and vacant, a kind of blind, white flicker in the depths of the orbs, which died out slowly. The man seemed youngalmost a boybut you know with them its hard to tell. I found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good Swedes ships biscuits I had in my pocket. The fingers closed slowly on it and heldthere was no other movement and no other glance. He had tied a bit of white worsted round his neckWhy? Where did he get it? Was it a badgean ornamenta charma propitiatory act? Was there any idea at all connected with it? It looked startling round his black neck, this bit of white thread from beyond the seas. Near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their legs drawn up. One, with his chin propped on his knees, stared at nothing, in an intolerable and appalling manner: his brother phantom rested its forehead, as if overcome with a great weariness; and all about others were scattered in every pose of contorted collapse, as in some picture of a massacre or a pestilence. While I stood horror-struck, JOSEPH CONRAD 27 one of these creatures rose to his hands and knees, and went off on all-fours towards the river to drink. He lapped out of his hand, then sat up in the sunlight, crossing his shins in front of him, and after a time let his woolly head fall on his breastbone. I didnt want any more loitering in the shade, and I made haste towards the station. When near the buildings I met a white man, in such an unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him for a sort of vision. I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clean necktie, and varnished boots. No hat. Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand. He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear. I shook hands with this miracle, and I learned he was the Companys chief accountant, and that all the bookkeeping was done at this station. He had come out for a moment, he said, to get a breath of fresh air. The expression sounded wonderfully odd, with its suggestion of sedentary desk-life. I wouldnt have mentioned the fellow to you at all, only it was from his lips that I first heard the name of the man who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time. Moreover, I respected the fellow. Yes; I respected his collars, his vast cuffs, his brushed hair. His appearance was certainly that of a hairdressers dummy; but in the great demoralization of the land he kept up his appearance. Thats backbone. His starched collars and got-up shirt-fronts were achievements of character. He had been out nearly three years; and, later, I could not help asking him how he managed to sport such linen. He had just the faintest blush, and said modestly, Ive 28 HEART OF DARKNESS been teaching one of the native women about the station. It was difficult. She had a distaste for the work. Thus this man had verily accomplished something. And he was devoted to his books, which were in apple-pie order. Everything else in the station was in a muddle heads, things, buildings. Strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and departed; a stream of manufactured goods, rubbishy cottons, beads, and brass-wire set into the depths of darkness, and in return came a precious trickle of ivory. I had to wait in the station for ten daysan eternity. I lived in a hut in the yard, but to be out of the chaos I would sometimes get into the accountants office. It was built of horizontal planks, and",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,10,"so badly put together that, as he bent over his high desk, he was barred from neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight. There was no need to open the big shutter to see. It was hot there, too; big flies buzzed fiendishly, and did not sting, but stabbed. I sat generally on the floor, while, of faultless appearance (and even slightly scented), perching on a high stool, he wrote, he wrote. Sometimes he stood up for exercise. When a truckle- bed with a sick man (some invalid agent from upcountry) was put in there, he exhibited a gentle annoyance. The groans of this sick person, he said, distract my attention. And without that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors in this climate. One day he remarked, without lifting his head, In the interior you will no doubt meet Mr. Kurtz. On my asking who Mr. Kurtz was, he said he was a first- class agent; and seeing my disappointment at this information, he added slowly, laying down his pen, JOSEPH CONRAD 29 He is a very remarkable person. Further questions elicited from him that Mr. Kurtz was at present in charge of a trading-post, a very important one, in the true ivory-country, at the very bottom of there. Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together . . . He began to write again. The sick man was too ill to groan. The flies buzzed in a great peace. Suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of feet. A caravan had come in. A violent babble of uncouth sounds burst out on the other side of the planks. All the carriers were speaking together, and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable voice of the chief agent was heard giving it up tearfully for the twentieth time that day. . . . He rose slowly. What a frightful row, he said. He crossed the room gently to look at the sick man, and returning, said to me, He does not hear. What! Dead? I asked, startled. No, not yet, he answered, with great composure. Then, alluding with a toss of the head to the tumult in the station-yard, When one has got to those make correct entries, one comes savageshate them to the death. He remained thoughtful for a moment. When you see Mr. Kurtz, he went on, tell him from me that everything here he glanced at the deskis very satisfactory. I dont like to write to himwith those messengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letterat that Central Station. He stared at me for a moment with his mild, bulging eyes. Oh, he will go far, very far, he began again. He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, abovethe Council in Europe, you knowmean him to be. to hate 30 HEART OF DARKNESS He turned to his work. The noise outside had ceased, and presently in going out I stopped at the door. In the steady buzz of flies the homeward-bound agent was lying flushed and insensible; the other, bent over his books, was making correct entries of perfectly correct transactions; and fifty feet below the doorstep I could see the still tree-tops of the grove of death. Next day I left that station at last, with a caravan of sixty men, for a two-hundred-mile tramp. No use telling you much about that. Paths, paths, everywhere; a stamped-in network of paths spreading over the empty land, through the long grass, through burnt grass, through thickets, down and up chilly ravines, up and down stony hills ablaze with heat; and a solitude, a solitude, nobody, not a hut. The population had cleared out a long time ago. Well, if a lot of mysterious niggers armed with all kinds of fearful weapons suddenly took to travelling on the road between Deal and Gravesend, catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy loads for them, I fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty very soon. Only here the dwellings were gone, too. Still I passed through several abandoned villages. Theres something pathetically childish in the ruins of grass walls. Day after day, with the stamp and shuffle of sixty pair of bare feet behind me, each pair under a 60-lb. load. Camp, cook, sleep, strike camp, march. Now and then a carrier dead in harness, at rest in the long grass near the path, with an empty water-gourd and his long staff lying by his side. A great silence around and above. Perhaps on some quiet night the tremor of far-off drums, sinking, swelling, a tremor vast, faint; a sound weird, appealing, suggestive, and wildand perhaps with as JOSEPH CONRAD 31 profound a meaning as",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,11,"the sound of bells in a Christian country. Once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform, camping on the path with an armed escort of lank Zanzibaris, very hospitable and festivenot to say drunk. Was looking after the upkeep of the road, he declared. Cant say I saw any road or any upkeep, unless the body of a middle-aged negro, with a bullet- hole in the forehead, upon which I absolutely stumbled three miles farther on, may be considered as a permanent improvement. I had a white companion, too, not a bad chap, but rather too fleshy and with the exasperating habit of fainting on the hot hillsides, miles away from the least bit of shade and water. Annoying, you know, to hold your own coat like a parasol over a mans head while he is coming to. I couldnt help asking him once what he meant by coming there at all. To make money, of course. What do you think? he said, scornfully. Then he got fever, and had to be carried in a hammock slung under a pole. As he weighed sixteen stone I had no end of rows with the carriers. They jibbed, ran away, sneaked off with their loads in the nightquite a mutiny. So, one evening, I made a speech in English with gestures, not one of which was lost to the sixty pairs of eyes before me, and the next morning I started the hammock off in front all right. An hour afterwards I came upon the whole concern wrecked in a bushman, hammock, groans, blankets, horrors. The heavy pole had skinned his poor nose. He was very anxious for me to kill somebody, but there wasnt the shadow of a carrier near. I remembered the old doctorIt would be interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals, on the spot. I felt I was becoming 32 HEART OF DARKNESS scientifically interesting. However, all that is to no purpose. On the fifteenth day I came in sight of the big river again, and hobbled into the Central Station. It was on a back water surrounded by scrub and forest, with a pretty border of smelly mud on one side, and on the three others enclosed by a crazy fence of rushes. A neglected gap was all the gate it had, and the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show. White men with long staves in their hands appeared languidly from amongst the buildings, strolling up to take a look at me, and then retired out of sight somewhere. One of them, a stout, excitable chap with black moustaches, informed me with great volubility and many digressions, as soon as I told him who I was, that my steamer was at the bottom of the river. I was thunderstruck. What, how, why? Oh, it was all right. The manager himself was there. All quite correct. Everybody had behaved splendidly! splendidly! you must, he said in agitation, go and see the general manager at once. He is waiting! I did not see the real significance of that wreck at once. I fancy I see it now, but I am not surenot at all. Certainly the affair was too stupidwhen I think of itto be altogether natural. Still . . . But at the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance. The steamer was sunk. They had started two days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the manager on board, in charge of some volunteer skipper, and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom out of her on stones, and she sank near the south bank. I asked myself what I was to do there, now my boat was lost. As a matter of fact, I had plenty to JOSEPH CONRAD 33 do in fishing my command out of the river. I had to set about it the very next day. That, and the repairs when I brought the pieces to the station, took some months. there was only an that morning. He was commonplace My first interview with the manager was curious. He did not ask me to sit down after my twenty-mile in walk complexion, in features, in manners, and in voice. He was of middle size and of ordinary build. His eyes, of the usual blue, were perhaps remarkably cold, and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as trenchant and heavy as an axe. But even at these times the rest of his person seemed to disclaim the intention. indefinable, faint Otherwise expression of his lips, something stealthya smile not a smileI remember it, but I cant explain. It was unconscious, this smile was, though just after he had",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,12,"said something it got intensified for an instant. It came at the end of his speeches like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable. He was a common trader, from his youth up employed in these parts nothing more. He was obeyed, yet he inspired neither love nor fear, nor even respect. He inspired uneasiness. That was it! Uneasiness. Not a definite mistrustjust uneasinessnothing more. You have no idea how effective such a . . . a . . . faculty can be. He had no genius for organizing, for initiative, or for order even. That was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station. He had no learning, and no intelligence. His position had come to himwhy? Perhaps because he was never ill . . . He had served three terms of three years out there . . . Because triumphant health in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in 34 HEART OF DARKNESS Jack ashorewith scalepompously. itself. When he went home on leave he rioted on a a large differencein externals only. This one could gather from his casual talk. He originated nothing, he could keep the routine goingthats all. But he was great. He was great by this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control such a man. He never gave that secret away. Perhaps there was nothing within him. Such a suspicion made one pausefor out there there were no external checks. Once when various tropical diseases had laid low almost every agent in the station, he was heard to say, Men who come out here should have no entrails. He sealed the utterance with that smile of his, as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping. You fancied you had seen thingsbut the seal was on. When annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence, he ordered an immense round table to be made, for which a special house had to be built. This was the stations mess- room. Where he sat was the first placethe rest were nowhere. One felt this to be his unalterable conviction. He was neither civil nor uncivil. He was quiet. He allowed his boyan overfed young negro from the coastto treat the white men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence. He began to speak as soon as he saw me. I had been very long on the road. He could not wait. Had to start without me. The up-river stations had to be relieved. There had been so many delays already that he did not know who was dead and who was alive, and how they got onand so on, and so on. He paid no attention to my explanations, and, playing with a stick JOSEPH CONRAD 35 that times of sealing-wax, repeated several the situation was very grave, very grave. There were rumours that a very important station was in jeopardy, and its chief, Mr. Kurtz, was ill. Hoped it was not true. Mr. Kurtz was . . . I felt weary and irritable. Hang Kurtz, I thought. I interrupted him by saying I had heard of Mr. Kurtz on the coast. Ah! So they talk of him down there, he murmured to himself. Then he began again, assuring me Mr. Kurtz was the best agent he had, an exceptional man, of the greatest importance to the Company; therefore I could understand his anxiety. He was, he said, very, very uneasy. Certainly he fidgeted on his chair a good deal, exclaimed, Ah, Mr. Kurtz! broke the stick of sealing-wax and seemed dumfounded by the accident. Next thing he wanted to know how long it would take to . . . I interrupted him again. Being hungry, you know, and kept on my feet too, I was getting savage. How can I tell? I said. I havent even seen the wreck yetsome months, no doubt. All this talk seemed to me so futile. Some months, he said. Well, let us say three months before we can make a start. Yes. That ought to do the affair. I flung out of his hut (he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of verandah) muttering to myself my opinion of him. He was a chattering idiot. Afterwards I took it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite for the affair. I went to work the next day, turning, so to speak, my back on that station. In that way only it seemed to me I could keep my hold on the redeeming facts of life. Still, one must look about sometimes;",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,13,"and then I saw this station, these men strolling aimlessly about in 36 HEART OF DARKNESS the sunshine of the yard. I asked myself sometimes what it all meant. They wandered here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence. The word ivory rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed. You would think they were praying to it. A taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all, like a whiff from some corpse. By Jove! Ive never seen anything so unreal in my life. And outside, the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion. Oh, these months! Well, never mind. Various things happened. One evening a grass shed full of calico, cotton prints, beads, and I dont know what else, burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have thought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that trash. I was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer, and saw them all cutting capers in the light, with their arms lifted high, when the stout man with moustaches came tearing down to the river, a tin pail in his hand, assured me that everybody was behaving splendidly, splendidly, dipped about a quart of water and tore back again. I noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail. I strolled up. There was no hurry. You see the thing had gone off like a box of matches. It had been hopeless from the very first. The flame had leaped high, driven everybody back, lighted up everything and collapsed. The shed was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely. A nigger was being beaten near by. They said he had caused the fire in some way; be that JOSEPH CONRAD 37 talking. I heard as it may, he was screeching most horribly. I saw him, later, for several days, sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick and trying to recover himself: afterwards he arose and went outand the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again. As I approached the glow from the dark I found myself at the back of two men, the name of Kurtz pronounced, then the words, take advantage of this unfortunate accident. One of the men was the manager. I wished him a good evening. Did you ever see anything like iteh? it is incredible, he said, and walked off. The other man remained. He was a first- class agent, young, gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with a forked little beard and a hooked nose. He was stand- offish with the other agents, and they on their side said he was the managers spy upon them. As to me, I had hardly ever spoken to him before. We got into talk, and by and by we strolled away from the hissing ruins. Then he asked me to his room, which was in the main building of the station. He struck a match, and I perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a silver-mounted dressing-case but also a whole candle all to himself. Just at that time the manager was the only man supposed to have any right to candles. Native mats covered the clay walls; a collection of spears, assegais, shields, knives was hung up in trophies. The business intrusted to this fellow was the making of bricksso I had been informed; but there wasnt a fragment of a brick anywhere in the station, and he had been there more than a yearwaiting. It seems he could not make bricks without something, I dont know whatstraw maybe. Anyway, it could not be found there, and as it was not likely to be sent from 38 HEART OF DARKNESS Europe, it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for. An act of special creation perhaps. However, they were all waitingall the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of themfor something; and upon my word it did not seem an uncongenial occupation, from the way they took it, though the only thing that ever came to them was diseaseas far as I could see. They beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against each other in a foolish kind of way. There was an air of plotting about that station, but nothing came of it, of course. It was as unreal as everything elseas the philanthropic pretence of the whole concern, as their talk, as their government, as their show of work. The only real feeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where ivory was to be had, so that they could earn percentages. They",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,14,"intrigued and slandered and hated each other only on that accountbut as to effectually lifting a little fingeroh, no. By heavens! there is something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while another must not look at a halter. Steal a horse straight out. Very well. He has done it. Perhaps he can ride. But there is a way of looking at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick. I had no idea why he wanted to be sociable, but as we chatted in there it suddenly occurred to me the fellow was trying to get at somethingin fact, pumping me. He alluded constantly to Europe, to the people I was supposed to know thereputting leading questions as to my acquaintances in the sepulchral city, and so on. His little eyes glittered like mica discs with curiositythough he tried to keep up a bit of superciliousness. At first I was astonished, but very JOSEPH CONRAD 39 soon I became awfully curious to see what he would find out from me. I couldnt possibly imagine what I had in me to make it worth his while. It was very pretty to see how he baffled himself, for in truth my body was full only of chills, and my head had nothing in it but that wretched steamboat business. It was evident he took me for a perfectly shameless prevaricator. At last he got angry, and, to conceal a movement of furious annoyance, he yawned. I rose. Then I noticed a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman, draped and blindfolded, carrying a lighted torch. The background was sombrealmost black. The movement of the woman was stately, and the effect of the torchlight on the face was sinister. It arrested me, and he stood by civilly, holding an empty half-pint champagne bottle (medical comforts) with the candle stuck in it. To my question he said Mr. Kurtz had painted thisin this very station more than a year agowhile waiting for means to go to his trading-post. Tell me, pray, said I, who is this Mr. Kurtz? The chief of the Inner Station, he answered in a short tone, looking away. Much obliged, I said, laughing. And you are the brickmaker of the Central Station. Every one knows that. He was silent for a while. He is a prodigy, he said at last. He is an emissary of pity and science and progress, and devil knows what else. We want, he began to declaim suddenly, for the guidance of the cause intrusted to us by Europe, so to speak, higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose. Who says that? I asked. Lots of them, he replied. Some even write that; and so he comes here, a special being, as you 40 HEART OF DARKNESS ought to know. Why ought I to know? I interrupted, really surprised. He paid no attention. Yes. To-day he is chief of the best station, next year he will be assistant-manager, two years more and . . . but I daresay you know what he will be in two years time. You are of the new gangthe gang of virtue. The same people who sent him specially also recommended you. Oh, dont say no. Ive my own eyes to trust. Light dawned upon me. My dear aunts influential acquaintances were producing an unexpected effect upon that young man. I nearly burst into a laugh. Do you read the Companys confidential correspondence? I asked. He hadnt a word to say. It was great fun. When Mr. Kurtz, I continued, severely, is General Manager, you wont have the opportunity. He blew the candle out suddenly, and we went outside. The moon had risen. Black figures strolled about listlessly, pouring water on the glow, whence proceeded a sound of hissing; steam ascended in the moonlight, the beaten nigger groaned somewhere. What a row the brute makes! said the indefatigable man with the moustaches, appearing near us. Serve him right. Transgressionpunishmentbang! Pitiless, pitiless. Thats the only way. This will prevent all conflagrations for the future. I was just telling the manager . . . He noticed my companion, and became crestfallen all at once. Not in bed yet, he said, with a kind of servile heartiness; its so natural. Ha! Dangeragitation. He vanished. I went on to the riverside, and the other followed me. I heard a scathing murmur at my ear, Heap of muffsgo to. The pilgrims could be seen in knots gesticulating, discussing. Several had still their staves in their hands. JOSEPH CONRAD 41 I verily believe they took these sticks to bed with them. Beyond the fence the forest stood up spectrally in the moonlight, and through the dim stir, through the faint sounds of",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,15,"that lamentable courtyard, the silence of the land went home to ones very heartits mystery, its greatness, the amazing reality of its concealed life. The hurt nigger moaned feebly somewhere near by, and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my pace away from there. I felt a hand introducing itself under my arm. My dear sir, said the fellow, I dont want to be misunderstood, and especially by you, who will see Mr. Kurtz long before I can have that pleasure. I wouldnt like him to get a false idea of my disposi- tion. . . . I let him run on, this papier-mach Mephistoph- eles, and it seemed to me that if I tried I could poke my forefinger through him, and would find nothing inside but a little loose dirt, maybe. He, dont you see, had been planning to be assistant-manager by and by under the present man, and I could see that the coming of that Kurtz had upset them both not a little. He talked precipitately, and I did not try to stop him. I had my shoulders against the wreck of my steamer, hauled up on the slope like a carcass of some big river animal. The smell of mud, of primeval mud, by Jove! was in my nostrils, the high stillness of primeval forest was before my eyes; there were shiny patches on the black creek. The moon had spread over everything a thin layer of silverover the rank grass, over the mud, upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple, over the great river I could see through a sombre gap glittering, glittering, as it flowed broadly by without a murmur. All this was 42 HEART OF DARKNESS great, expectant, mute, while the man jabbered about himself. I wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace. What were we who had strayed in here? Could we handle that dumb thing, or would it handle us? I felt how big, how confoundedly big, was that thing that couldnt talk, and perhaps was deaf as well. What was in there? I could see a little ivory coming out from there, and I had heard Mr. Kurtz was in there. I had heard enough about it, tooGod knows! Yet somehow it didnt bring any image with itno more than if I had been told an angel or a fiend was in there. I believed it in the same way one of you might believe there are inhabitants in the planet Mars. I knew once a Scotch sailmaker who was certain, dead sure, there were people in Mars. If you asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved, he would get shy and mutter something about walking on all-fours. If you as much as smiled, he wouldthough a man of sixtyoffer to fight you. I would not have gone so far as to fight for Kurtz, but I went for him near enough to a lie. You know I hate, detest, and cant bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in lieswhich is exactly what I hate and detest in the worldwhat I want to forget. It makes me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do. Temperament, I suppose. Well, I went near enough to it by letting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in Europe. I became in an instant as much of a pretence as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims. This simply because I had a notion it somehow would be of help to JOSEPH CONRAD 43 that Kurtz whom at the time I did not seeyou understand. He was just a word for me. I did not see the man in the name any more than you do. Do you see him? Do you see the story? Do you see anything? It seems to me I am trying to tell you a dreammaking a vain attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation, that commingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt, that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams. . . . He was silent for a while. . . . No, it is impossible; it is impossible to convey the life-sensation of any given epoch of ones existencethat which makes its truth, its meaningits subtle and penetrating essence. It is impossible. We live, as we dreamalone. . . . He paused again as if reflecting, then added Of",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,16,"course in this you fellows see more than I could then. You see me, whom you know. . . . It had become so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one another. For a long time already he, sitting apart, had been no more to us than a voice. There was not a word from anybody. The others might have been asleep, but I was awake. I listened, I listened on the watch for the sentence, for the word, that would give me the clue to the faint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that seemed to shape itself without human lips in the heavy night-air of the river. . . . YesI let him run on, Marlow began again, and think what he pleased about the powers that were behind me. I did! And there was nothing behind me! There was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled steamboat I was leaning against, while he talked 44 HEART OF DARKNESS fluently about the necessity for every man to get on. And when one comes out here, you conceive, it is not to gaze at the moon. Mr. Kurtz was a universal genius, but even a genius would find it easier to work with adequate toolsintelligent men. He did not make brickswhy, there was a physical impossibility in the wayas I was well aware; and if he did secretarial work for the manager, it was because no sensible man rejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors. Did I see it? I saw it. What more did I want? What I really wanted was rivets, by heaven! Rivets. To get on with the workto stop the hole. Rivets I wanted. There were cases of them down at the coastcasespiled upburstsplit! You kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that station-yard on the hillside. Rivets had rolled into the grove of death. You could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping downand there wasnt one rivet to be found where it was wanted. We had plates that would do, but nothing to fasten them with. And every week the messenger, a lone negro, letter-bag on shoulder and staff in hand, left our station for the coast. And several times a week a coast caravan came in with trade goodsghastly glazed calico that made you shudder only to look at it, glass beads value about a penny a quart, confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs. And no rivets. Three carriers could have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat. He was becoming confidential now, but I fancy my unresponsive attitude must have exasperated him at last, for he judged it necessary to inform me he feared neither God nor devil, let alone any mere man. I said I could see that very well, but what I wanted was a JOSEPH CONRAD 45 certain quantity of rivetsand rivets were what really Mr. Kurtz wanted, if he had only known it. Now letters went to the coast every week. . . . My dear sir, he cried, I write from dictation. I demanded rivets. There was a wayfor an intelligent man. He changed his manner; became very cold, and suddenly began to talk about a hippopotamus; wondered whether sleeping on board the steamer (I stuck to my salvage night and day) I wasnt disturbed. There was an old hippo that had the bad habit of getting out on the bank and roaming at night over the station grounds. The pilgrims used to turn out in a body and empty every rifle they could lay hands on at him. Some even had sat up o nights for him. All this energy was wasted, though. That animal has a charmed life, he said; but you can say this only of brutes in this country. No manyou apprehend me?no man here bears a charmed life. He stood there for a moment in the moonlight with his delicate hooked nose set a little askew, and his mica eyes glittering without a wink, then, with a curt Good- night, he strode off. I could see he was disturbed and considerably puzzled, which made me feel more hopeful than I had been for days. It was a great comfort to turn from that chap to my influential friend, the battered, twisted, ruined, tin-pot steamboat. I clambered on board. She rang under my feet like an empty Huntley & Palmer biscuit-tin kicked along a gutter; she was nothing so solid in make, and rather less pretty in shape, but I had expended enough hard work on her to make me love her. No influential friend would have served me better. She had given me a chance to come out a bitto find out what I could do. No, I dont like work. I had rather laze",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,17,"about and think 46 HEART OF DARKNESS of all the fine things that can be done. I dont like workno man doesbut I like what is in the work the chance to find yourself. Your own realityfor yourself, not for otherswhat no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means. I was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft, on the deck, with his legs dangling over the mud. You see I rather chummed with the few mechanics there were in that station, whom the other pilgrims naturally despisedon account of their imperfect manners, I suppose. This was the foremana boiler-maker by tradea good worker. He was a lank, bony, yellow- faced man, with big intense eyes. His aspect was worried, and his head was as bald as the palm of my hand; but his hair in falling seemed to have stuck to his chin, and had prospered in the new locality, for his beard hung down to his waist. He was a widower with six young children (he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come out there), and the passion of his life was pigeon-flying. He was an enthusiast and a connoisseur. He would rave about pigeons. After work hours he used sometimes to come over from his hut for a talk about his children and his pigeons; at work, when he had to crawl in the mud under the bottom of the steamboat, he would tie up that beard of his in a kind of white serviette he brought for the purpose. It had loops to go over his ears. In the evening he could be seen squatted on the bank rinsing that wrapper in the creek with great care, then spreading it solemnly on a bush to dry. I slapped him on the back and shouted, We shall have rivets! He scrambled to his feet exclaiming, No! JOSEPH CONRAD 47 Rivets! as though he couldnt believe his ears. Then in a low voice, You . . . eh? I dont know why we behaved like lunatics. I put my finger to the side of my nose and nodded mysteriously. Good for you! he cried, snapped his fingers above his head, lifting one foot. I tried a jig. We capered on the iron deck. A frightful clatter came out of that hulk, and the virgin forest on the other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon the sleeping station. It must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in their hovels. A dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the managers hut, vanished, then, a second or so after, the doorway itself vanished, too. We stopped, and the silence driven away by the stamping of our feet flowed back again from the recesses of the land. The great wall of vegetation, an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks, branches, leaves, boughs, festoons, motionless in the moonlight, was like a rioting invasion of soundless life, a rolling wave of plants, piled up, crested, ready to topple over the creek, to sweep every little man of us out of his little existence. And it moved not. A deadened burst of mighty splashes and snorts reached us from afar, as though an ichthyosaurus had been taking a bath of glitter in the great river. After all, said the boiler-maker in a reasonable tone, why shouldnt we get the rivets? Why not, indeed! I did not know of any reason why we shouldnt. Theyll come in three weeks, I said, confidently. But they didnt. Instead of rivets there came an invasion, an infliction, a visitation. It came in sections during the next three weeks, each section headed by a donkey carrying a white man in new clothes and tan shoes, bowing from that elevation right and left to the 48 HEART OF DARKNESS impressed pilgrims. A quarrelsome band of footsore sulky niggers trod on the heels of the donkey; a lot of tents, camp-stools, tin boxes, white cases, brown bales would be shot down in the court-yard, and the air of mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the station. Five such instalments came, with their absurd air of disorderly flight with the loot of innumerable outfit shops and provision stores, that, one would think, they were lugging, after a raid, into the wilderness for equitable division. It was an inextricable mess of things decent in themselves but that human folly made look like the spoils of thieving. This devoted band called itself the Eldorado Exploring Expedition, and I believe they were sworn to secrecy. Their talk, however, was the talk of sordid buccaneers: it was reckless without hardihood, greedy without audacity, and cruel without courage; there",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,18,"was not an atom of foresight or of serious intention in the whole batch of them, and they did not seem aware these things are wanted for the work of the world. To tear treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire, with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into a safe. Who paid the expenses of the noble enterprise I dont know; but the uncle of our manager was leader of that lot. In exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neighbourhood, and his eyes had a look of sleepy cunning. He carried his fat paunch with ostentation on his short legs, and during the time his gang infested the station spoke to no one but his nephew. You could see these two roaming about all day long with their heads close together in an everlasting confab. JOSEPH CONRAD 49 I had given up worrying myself about the rivets. Ones capacity for that kind of folly is more limited than you would suppose. I said Hang!and let things slide. I had plenty of time for meditation, and now and then I would give some thought to Kurtz. I wasnt very interested in him. No. Still, I was curious to see whether this man, who had come out equipped with moral ideas of some sort, would climb to the top after all and how he would set about his work when there. II One evening as I was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat, I heard voices approachingand there were the nephew and the uncle strolling along the bank. I laid my head on my arm again, and had nearly lost myself in a doze, when somebody said in my ear, as it were: I am as harmless as a little child, but I dont like to be dictated to. Am I the manageror am I not? I was ordered to send him there. Its incredible. . . . I became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside the forepart of the steamboat, just below my head. I did not move; it did not occur to me to move: I was sleepy. It is unpleasant, grunted the uncle. He has asked the Administration to be sent there, said the other, with the idea of showing what he could do; and I was instructed accordingly. Look at the influence that man must have. Is it not frightful? They both agreed it was frightful, then made several bizarre remarks: Make rain and fine weatherone manthe Councilby the nosebits of absurd sentences that got the better of my drowsiness, so that I had pretty near the whole of my wits about me when the uncle said, The climate may do away with this difficulty for you. Is he alone there? Yes, answered the manager; he sent his assistant down the river with a note to me in these terms: Clear this poor devil out of the country, and dont bother sending more of that sort. I had rather be alone than have the kind of men 50 JOSEPH CONRAD 51 you can dispose of with me. It was more than a year ago. Can you imagine such impudence! Anything since then? asked the other, hoarsely. Ivory, jerked the nephew; lots of itprime sortlotsmost annoying, from him. And with that? questioned the heavy rumble. Invoice, was the reply fired out, so to speak. Then silence. They had been talking about Kurtz. I was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly at ease, remained still, having no inducement to change my position. How did that ivory come all this way? growled the elder man, who seemed very vexed. The other explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an English half-caste clerk Kurtz had with him; that Kurtz had apparently intended to return himself, the station being by that time bare of goods and stores, but after coming three hundred miles, had suddenly decided to go back, which he started to do alone in a small dugout with four paddlers, leaving the half-caste to continue down the river with the ivory. The two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such a thing. They were at a loss for an adequate motive. As to me, I seemed to see Kurtz for the first time. It was a distinct glimpse: the dugout, four paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back suddenly on the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of homeperhaps; setting his face towards the depths of the wilderness, towards his empty and desolate station. I did not know the motive. Perhaps he was just simply a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake. His",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,19,"name, you understand, had not been pronounced once. He was that man. The half-caste, who, as far as I could see, 52 HEART OF DARKNESS had conducted a difficult trip with great prudence and pluck, was invariably alluded to as that scoundrel. The scoundrel had reported that the man had been very illhad recovered imperfectly. . . . The two below me moved away then a few paces, and strolled back and forth at some little distance. I heard: Military postdoctortwo hundred milesquite alone now unavoidable delaysnine monthsno newsstrange rumours. They approached again, just as the manager was saying, No one, as far as I know, unless a species of wandering tradera pestilential fellow, snapping ivory from the natives. Who was it they were talking about now? I gathered in snatches that this was some man supposed to be in Kurtzs district, and of whom the manager did not approve. We will not be free from unfair competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example, he said. Certainly, grunted the other; get him hanged! Why not? Anythinganything can be done in this country. Thats what I say; nobody here, you understand, here, can endanger your position. And why? You stand the climateyou outlast them all. The danger is in Europe; but there before I left I took care to They moved off and The their voices whispered, extraordinary series of delays is not my fault. I did my best. The fat man sighed. Very sad. And the pestiferous absurdity of his talk, continued the other; he bothered me enough when he was here. Each station should be like a beacon on the road towards better things, a centre for trade of course, but also for humanizing, improving, instructing. Conceive you that ass! And he wants to be manager! No, its Here he got choked by excessive indignation, and I rose again. then JOSEPH CONRAD 53 lifted my head the least bit. I was surprised to see how near they wereright under me. I could have spat upon their hats. They were looking on the ground, absorbed in thought. The manager was switching his leg with a slender twig: his sagacious relative lifted his head. You have been well since you came out this time? he asked. The other gave a start. Who? I? Oh! Like a charmlike a charm. But the restoh, my goodness! All sick. They die so quick, too, that I havent the time to send them out of the countryits incredible! Hm. Just so, grunted the uncle. Ah! my boy, trust to thisI say, trust to this. I saw him extend his short flipper of an arm for a gesture that took in the forest, the creek, the mud, the riverseemed to beckon with a dishonouring flourish before the sunlit face of the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the hidden evil, to the profound darkness of its heart. It was so startling that I leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest, as though I had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of confidence. You know the foolish notions that come to one sometimes. The high stillness confronted these two figures with its ominous patience, waiting for the passing away of a fantastic invasion. They swore aloud togetherout of sheer fright, I believethen pretending not to know anything of my existence, turned back to the station. The sun was low; and leaning forward side by side, they seemed to be tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows of unequal length, that trailed behind them slowly over the tall grass without bending a single blade. In a few days the Eldorado Expedition went into the patient wilderness, that closed upon it as the sea 54 HEART OF DARKNESS closes over a diver. Long afterwards the news came that all the donkeys were dead. I know nothing as to the fate of the less valuable animals. They, no doubt, like the rest of us, found what they deserved. I did not inquire. I was then rather excited at the prospect of meeting Kurtz very soon. When I say very soon I mean it comparatively. It was just two months from the day we left the creek when we came to the bank below Kurtzs station. Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest. The air was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish. There was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine. The long stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into the gloom of overshadowed distances. On silvery sand-banks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by side.",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,20,"The broadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands; you lost your way on that river as you would in a desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to find the channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for ever from everything you had known oncesomewherefar awayin another existence perhaps. There were moments when ones past came back to one, as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare to yourself; but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream, remembered with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of plants, and water, and silence. And this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a peace. It was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention. It looked at you JOSEPH CONRAD 55 with a vengeful aspect. I got used to it afterwards; I did not see it any more; I had no time. I had to keep guessing at the channel; I had to discern, mostly by inspiration, the signs of hidden banks; I watched for sunken stones; I was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out, when I shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the life out of the tin-pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims; I had to keep a lookout for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night for next days steaming. When you have to attend to things of that sort, to the mere incidents of the surface, the reality the reality, I tell youfades. The inner truth is hiddenluckily, luckily. But I felt it all the same; I felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at my monkey it watches you fellows performing on your respective tight-ropes forwhat is it? half-a-crown a tumble just as tricks, Try to be civil, Marlow, growled a voice, and I knew there was at least one listener awake besides myself. I beg your pardon. I forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of the price. And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well done? You do your tricks very well. And I didnt do badly either, since I managed not to sink that steamboat on my first trip. Its a wonder to me yet. Imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road. I sweated and shivered over that business considerably, I can tell you. After all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing thats supposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin. No one may know of it, but you never forget the thumpeh? A blow on the very heart. 56 HEART OF DARKNESS You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night and think of ityears afterand go hot and cold all over. I dont pretend to say that steamboat floated all the time. More than once she had to wade for a bit, with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing. We had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew. Fine fellowscannibalsin their place. They were men one could work with, and I am grateful to them. And, after all, they did not eat each other before my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo- meat which went rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my nostrils. Phoo! I can sniff it now. I had the manager on board and three or four pilgrims with their stavesall complete. Sometimes we came upon a station close by the bank, clinging to the skirts of the unknown, and the white men rushing out of a tumble-down hovel, with great gestures of joy and surprise and welcome, seemed very strangehad the appearance of being held there captive by a spell. The word ivory would ring in the air for a whileand on we went again into the silence, along empty reaches, round the still bends, between the high walls of our winding way, reverberating in hollow claps the trees, ponderous beat of the stern-wheel. Trees, millions of trees, massive, immense, running up high; and at their foot, hugging the bank against the stream, crept the little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the floor of a lofty portico. It made you feel very small, very lost, and yet it was not altogether depressing, that feeling. After all, if you were small, the grimy beetle crawled onwhich was just what you wanted it to do. Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to I dont know. To some place JOSEPH CONRAD 57 where they expected to get something, I bet! For me it crawled towards Kurtzexclusively;",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,21,"but when the steam-pipes started leaking we crawled very slow. The reaches opened before us and closed behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness. It was very quiet there. At night sometimes the roll of drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till the first break of day. Whether it meant war, peace, or prayer we could not tell. The dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness; the wood-cutters slept, their fires burned low; the snapping of a twig would make you start. We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet. We could have fancied ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance, to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy. The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming uswho could tell? We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could not understand because we were too far and could not remember 58 HEART OF DARKNESS because we were travelling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving hardly a signand no memories. The earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but therethere you could look at a thing monstrous and free. It was unearthly, and the men were No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of itthis suspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanitylike yoursthe thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which youyou so remote from the night of first agescould comprehend. And why not? The mind of man is capable of anythingbecause everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future. What was there after all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour, rage who can tell?but truthtruth stripped of its cloak of time. Let the fool gape and shudderthe man knows, and can look on without a wink. But he must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore. He must meet that truth with his own true stuffwith his own inborn strength. Principles wont do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty ragsrags that would fly off at the first good shake. No; you want a deliberate belief. An appeal to me in this fiendish rowis there? Very well; I hear; I admit, but I have a voice, too, and for good or evil JOSEPH CONRAD 59 mine is the speech that cannot be silenced. Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine sentiments, is always safe. Whos that grunting? You wonder I didnt go ashore for a howl and a dance? Well, noI didnt. Fine sentiments, you say? Fine sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I had to mess about with white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on those leaky steam-pipesI tell you. I had to watch the steering, and circumvent those snags, and get the tin- pot along by hook or by crook. There was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man. And between whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman. He was an improved specimen; he could fire up a vertical boiler. He was there below me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking on his hind-legs. A few months of training had done for that really fine chap. He squinted at the steam- gauge and at the water-gauge with an evident",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,22,"effort of intrepidityand he had filed teeth, too, the poor devil, and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars on each of his cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of improving knowledge. He was useful because he had been instructed; and what he knew was thisthat should the water in that transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit inside the boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst, and take a terrible vengeance. So he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully (with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and a piece of polished bone, as big as a watch, 60 HEART OF DARKNESS stuck flatways through his lower lip), while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly, the short noise was left behind, the interminable miles of silenceand we crept on, towards Kurtz. But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and thus neither that fireman nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts. Some fifty miles below the Inner Station we came upon a hut of reeds, an inclined and melancholy pole, with the unrecognizable tatters of what had been a flag of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked woodpile. This was unexpected. We came to the bank, and on the stack of firewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencil-writing on it. When deciphered it said: Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach it was cautiously. There was a signature, but illegiblenot Kurtza much longer word. Hurry up. Where? Up the river? Approach cautiously. We had not done so. But the warning could not have been meant for the place where it could be only found after approach. Something was wrong above. But what and how much? That was the question. We commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic style. The bush around said nothing, and would not let us look very far, either. A torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut, and flapped sadly in our faces. The dwelling was dismantled; but we could see a white man had lived there not very long ago. There remained a rude tablea plank on two posts; a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner, and by the door I picked up a book. It had lost its covers, and the pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness; but JOSEPH CONRAD 61 the back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which looked clean yet. It was an extraordinary find. Its title was, An Inquiry into some Points of Seamanship, by a man Towser, Towson some such nameMaster in his Majestys Navy. The matter looked dreary reading enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of figures, and the copy was sixty years old. I handled this amazing antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness, lest it should dissolve in my hands. Within, Towson or Towser was inquiring earnestly into the breaking strain of ships chains and tackle, and other such matters. Not a very enthralling book; but at the first glance you could see there a singleness of intention, an honest concern for the right way of going to work, which made these humble pages, thought out so many years ago, luminous with another than a professional light. The simple old sailor, with his talk of chains and purchases, made me forget the jungle and the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something unmistakably real. Such a book being there was wonderful enough; but still more astounding were the notes pencilled in the margin, and plainly referring to the text. I couldnt believe my eyes! They were in cipher! Yes, it looked like cipher. Fancy a man lugging with him a book of that description into this nowhere and studying itand making notesin cipher at that! It was an extravagant mystery. I had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying noise, and when I lifted my eyes I saw the woodpile was gone, and the manager, aided by all the pilgrims, was shouting at me from the riverside. I slipped the book into my pocket. I assure you to leave 62 HEART OF DARKNESS off reading was like tearing myself away from the shelter of an old and solid friendship. traderthis intruder, exclaimed I started the lame engine ahead. It must be this miserable the manager, looking back malevolently at the place we had left. He must be English, I said. It will",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Heart_Darkness,23,"not save him from getting into trouble if he is not careful, muttered the manager darkly. I observed with assumed innocence that no man was safe from trouble in this world. The current was more rapid now, the steamer seemed at her last gasp, the stern-wheel flopped languidly, and I caught myself listening on tiptoe for the next beat of the boat, for in sober truth I expected the wretched thing to give up every moment. It was like watching the last flickers of a life. But still we crawled. Sometimes I would pick out a tree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards Kurtz by, but I lost it invariably before we got abreast. To keep the eyes so long on one thing was too much for human a beautiful patience. The manager displayed resignation. I fretted and fumed and took to arguing with myself whether or no I would talk openly with Kurtz; but before I could come to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence, indeed any action of mine, would be a mere futility. What did it matter what any one knew or ignored? What did it matter who was manager? One gets sometimes such a flash of insight. The essentials of this affair lay deep under the surface, beyond my reach, and beyond my power of meddling. Towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight miles from Kurtzs JOSEPH CONRAD 63 station. I wanted to push on; but the manager looked grave, and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it would be advisable, the sun being very low already, to wait where we were till next morning. Moreover, he pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously were to be followed, we must approach in daylightnot at dusk, or in the dark. This was sensible enough. Eight miles meant nearly three hours steaming for us, and I could also see suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach. Nevertheless, I was annoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably, too, since one night more could not matter much after so many months. As we had plenty of wood, and caution was the word, I brought up in the middle of the stream. The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides like a railway cutting. The dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had set. The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility sat on the banks. The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into stone, even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not sleepit seemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest sound of any kind could be heard. You looked on amazed, and began to suspect yourself of being deafthen the night came suddenly, and struck you blind as well. About three in the morning some large fish leaped, and the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired. When the sun rose there was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more blinding than the night. It did not shift or drive; it was just there, standing all round you like something solid. At eight or nine, perhaps, it lifted as a shutter lifts. We had a glimpse of the 64 HEART OF DARKNESS ears. The towering multitude of trees, of the immense matted jungle, with the blazing little ball of the sun hanging over itall perfectly stilland then the white shutter came down again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves. I ordered the chain, which we had begun to heave in, to be paid out again. Before it stopped running with a muffled rattle, a cry, a very loud cry, as of infinite desolation, soared slowly in the opaque air. It ceased. A complaining clamour, modulated in sheer filled our savage discords, unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap. I dont know how it struck the others: to me it seemed as though the mist itself had screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all sides at once, did this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise. It culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short, leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and obstinately listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence. Good God! What is the meaning? stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrimsa little fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore side-spring boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks. Two others remained open-mouthed a whole minute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush out incontinently and stand darting scared",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,24,"glances, with Winchesters at ready in their hands. What we could see was just the steamer we were on, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of dissolving, and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around herand that was all. The rest of the world was nowhere, as far as our eyes and ears were concerned. Just nowhere. Gone, JOSEPH CONRAD 65 disappeared; swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind. I went forward, and ordered the chain to be hauled in short, so as to be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary. Will they attack? whispered an awed voice. We will be all butchered in this fog, murmured another. The faces twitched with the strain, the hands trembled slightly, the eyes forgot to wink. It was very curious to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black fellows of our crew, who were as much strangers to that part of the river as we, though their homes were only eight hundred miles away. The whites, of course greatly discomposed, had besides a curious look of being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row. The others had an alert, naturally interested expression; but their faces were essentially quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the chain. Several exchanged short, grunting phrases, which seemed to settle the matter to their satisfaction. Their headman, a young, broad-chested black, severely draped in dark-blue fringed cloths, with fierce nostrils and his hair all done up artfully in oily ringlets, stood near me. Aha! I said, just for good fellowships sake. Catch im, he snapped, with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teethcatch im. Give im to us. To you, eh? I asked; what would you do with them? Eat im! he said curtly, and, leaning his elbow on the rail, looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude. I would no doubt have been properly horrified, had it not occurred to me that he and his chaps must be very hungry: that they must have been growing increasingly hungry for at least this 66 HEART OF DARKNESS month past. They had been engaged for six months (I dont think a single one of them had any clear idea of time, as we at the end of countless ages have. They still belonged to the beginnings of timehad no inherited experience to teach them as it were), and of course, as long as there was a piece of paper written over in accordance with some farcical law or other made down the river, it didnt enter anybodys head to trouble how they would live. Certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippo-meat, which couldnt have lasted very long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadnt, in the midst of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity of it overboard. It looked like a high-handed proceeding; but it was really a case of legitimate self- defence. You cant breathe dead hippo waking, sleeping, and eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip on existence. Besides that, they had given them every week three pieces of brass wire, each about nine inches long; and the theory was they were to buy their provisions with that currency in riverside villages. You can see how that worked. There were either no villages, or the people were hostile, or the director, who like the rest of us fed out of tins, with an occasional old he-goat thrown in, didnt want to stop the steamer for some more or less recondite reason. So, unless they swallowed the wire itself, or made loops of it to snare the fishes with, I dont see what good their extravagant salary could be to them. I must say it was paid with a regularity worthy of a large and honourable trading company. For the rest, the only thing to eat though it didnt look eatable in the leastI saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like half- cooked dough, of a dirty lavender colour, they kept JOSEPH CONRAD 67 wrapped in leaves, and now and then swallowed a piece of, but so small that it seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose of sustenance. Why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they didnt go for usthey were thirty to fiveand have a good tuck-in for once, amazes me now when I think of it. They were big powerful men, with not much capacity to weigh the consequences, with courage, with strength, even yet, though their skins were no longer glossy and",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,25,"their muscles no longer hard. And I saw that something restraining, one of those human secrets that baffle probability, had come into play there. I looked at them with a swift quickening of interestnot because it occurred to me I might be eaten by them before very long, though I own to you that just then I perceivedin a new light, as it werehow unwholesome the pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes, I positively hoped, that my aspect was not sowhat shall I say?sounappetizing: a touch of fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dream- sensation that pervaded all my days at that time. Perhaps I had a little fever, too. One cant live with ones finger everlastingly on ones pulse. I had often a little fever, or a little touch of other thingsthe playful paw-strokes of the wilderness, the preliminary trifling before the more serious onslaught which came in due course. Yes; I looked at them as you would on any human being, with a curiosity of their impulses, motives, capacities, weaknesses, when brought to the test of an inexorable physical necessity. Restraint! What possible restraint? Was it superstition, disgust, patience, fearor some kind of primitive honour? No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear it 68 HEART OF DARKNESS to face bereavement, dishonour, and out, disgust simply does not exist where hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs, and what you may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze. Dont you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its exasperating torment, its black thoughts, its sombre and brooding ferocity? Well, I do. It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly. Its really easier the perdition of ones soulthan this kind of prolonged hunger. Sad, but true. And these chaps, too, had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple. Restraint! I would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst the corpses of a battlefield. But there was the fact facing methe fact dazzling, to be seen, like the foam on the depths of the sea, like a ripple on an unfathomable enigma, a mystery greater when I thought of itthan the curious, inexplicable note of desperate grief in this savage clamour that had swept by us on the river-bank, behind the blind whiteness of the fog. Two pilgrims were quarrelling in hurried whispers as to which bank. Left. No, no; how can you? Right, right, of course. It is very serious, said the managers voice behind me; I would be desolated if anything should happen to Mr. Kurtz before we came up. I looked at him, and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere. He was just the kind of man who would wish to preserve appearances. That was his restraint. But when he muttered something about going on at once, I did not even take the trouble to answer him. I knew, and he knew, that it was impossible. Were we to let go our hold of the bottom, we would be absolutely in the airin space. We wouldnt be able to JOSEPH CONRAD 69 tell where we were going towhether up or down stream, or acrosstill we fetched against one bank or the otherand then we wouldnt know at first which it was. Of course I made no move. I had no mind for a smash-up. You couldnt imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck. Whether drowned at once or not, we were sure to perish speedily in one way or another. I authorize you to take all the risks, he said, after a short silence. I refuse to take any, I said shortly; which was just the answer he expected, though its tone might have surprised him. Well, I must defer to your judgment. You are captain, he said, with marked civility. I turned my shoulder to him in sign of my appreciation, and looked into the fog. How long would it last? It was the most hopeless lookout. The approach to this Kurtz grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous castle. Will they attack, do you think? asked the manager, in a confidential tone. I did not think they would attack, for several obvious reasons. The thick fog was one. If they left the bank in their canoes they would get lost in it, as we would be if we attempted to move. Still, I had also judged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrable and yet eyes were in it, eyes that had seen us. The riverside bushes were certainly very thick; but the evidently penetrable. undergrowth behind was However, during the short lift I had seen no canoes anywhere",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,26,"in the reachcertainly not abreast of the idea of attack steamer. But what made inconceivable to me was the nature of the noiseof the cries we had heard. They had not the fierce the 70 HEART OF DARKNESS hostile boding character intention. immediate Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had given me an irresistible impression of sorrow. The glimpse of the steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained grief. The danger, if any, I expounded, was from our proximity to a great human passion let loose. Even extreme grief may ultimately vent itself in violencebut more generally takes the form of apathy. . . . You should have seen the pilgrims stare! They had no heart to grin, or even to revile me: but I believe they thought me gone madwith fright, maybe. I delivered a regular lecture. My dear boys, it was no good bothering. Keep a lookout? Well, you may guess I watched the fog for the signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse; but for anything else our eyes were of no more use to us than if we had been buried miles deep in a heap of cotton-wool. It felt like it, too choking, warm, stifling. Besides, all I said, though it sounded extravagant, was absolutely true to fact. What we afterwards alluded to as an attack was really an attempt at repulse. The action was very far from being aggressiveit was not even defensive, in the usual the stress of sense: desperation, and in its essence was purely protective. it was undertaken under It developed itself, I should say, two hours after the fog lifted, and its commencement was at a spot, roughly speaking, about a mile and a half below Kurtzs station. We had just floundered and flopped round a bend, when I saw an islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green, in the middle of the stream. It was the only thing of the kind; but as we opened the reach more, I perceived it was the head of a long sand- JOSEPH CONRAD 71 bank, or rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the river. They were discoloured, just awash, and the whole lot was seen just under the water, exactly as a mans backbone is seen running down the middle of his back under the skin. Now, as far as I did see, I could go to the right or to the left of this. I didnt know either channel, of course. The banks looked pretty well alike, the depth appeared the same; but as I had been informed the station was on the west side, I naturally headed for the western passage. No sooner had we fairly entered it than I became aware it was much narrower than I had supposed. To the left of us there was the long uninterrupted shoal, and to the right a high, steep bank heavily overgrown with bushes. Above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks. The twigs overhung the current thickly, and from distance to distance a large limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream. It was then well on in the afternoon, the face of the forest was gloomy, and a broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water. In this shadow we steamed upvery slowly, as you may imagine. I sheered her well inshorethe water being deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole informed me. One of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just below me. This steamboat was exactly like a decked scow. On the deck, there were two little teakwood houses, with doors and windows. The boiler was in the fore-end, and the machinery right astern. Over the whole there was a light roof, supported on stanchions. The funnel projected through that roof, and in front of the funnel a small cabin built of light planks served for a pilot- 72 HEART OF DARKNESS house. It contained a couch, two camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one corner, a tiny table, and the steering-wheel. It had a wide door in front and a broad shutter at each side. All these were always thrown open, of course. I spent my days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that roof, before the door. At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch. An athletic black belonging to some coast tribe, and educated by my poor predecessor, was the helmsman. He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all the world of himself. He was the most unstable kind of fool I had ever seen. He steered with no end of a swagger while",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
Heart_Darkness,27,"you were by; but if he lost sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and would let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute. I was looking down at the sounding-pole, and feeling much annoyed to see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river, when I saw my poleman give up the business suddenly, and stretch himself flat on the deck, without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in. He kept hold on it though, and it trailed in the water. At the same time the fireman, whom I could also see below me, sat down abruptly before his furnace and ducked his head. I was amazed. Then I had to look at the river mighty quick, because there was a snag in the fairway. Sticks, little sticks, were flying aboutthick: they were whizzing before my nose, dropping below me, striking behind me against my pilot-house. All this time the river, the shore, the woods, were very quietperfectly quiet. I could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern-wheel and JOSEPH CONRAD 73 the patter of these things. We cleared the snag clumsily. Arrows, by Jove! We were being shot at! I stepped in quickly to close the shutter on the land-side. That fool-helmsman, his hands on the spokes, was lifting his knees high, stamping his feet, champing his mouth, like a reined-in horse. Confound him! And we were staggering within ten feet of the bank. I had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter, and I saw a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own, looking at me very fierce and steady; and then suddenly, as though a veil had been removed from my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled gloom, naked legs, glaring eyesthe bush was breasts, arms, swarming with human limbs in movement, glistening, of bronze colour. The twigs shook, swayed, and rustled, the arrows flew out of them, and then the shutter came to. Steer her straight, I said to the helmsman. He held his head rigid, face forward; but his eyes rolled, he kept on lifting and setting down his feet gently, his mouth foamed a little. Keep quiet! I said in a fury. I might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind. I darted out. Below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron deck; confused exclamations; a voice screamed, Can you turn back? I caught sight of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead. What? Another snag! A fusillade burst out under my feet. The pilgrims had opened with their Winchesters, and were simply squirting lead into that bush. A deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward. I swore at it. Now I couldnt see the ripple or the snag either. I stood in the doorway, peering, and the arrows came in swarms. They might have been poisoned, but they looked as though they wouldnt kill a cat. The 74 HEART OF DARKNESS bush began to howl. Our wood-cutters raised a warlike whoop; the report of a rifle just at my back deafened me. I glanced over my shoulder, and the pilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I made a dash at the wheel. The fool-nigger had dropped everything, to throw the shutter open and let off that Martini-Henry. He stood before the wide opening, glaring, and I yelled at him to come back, while I straightened the sudden twist out of that steamboat. There was no room to turn even if I had wanted to, the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded smoke, there was no time to lose, so I just crowded her into the bankright into the bank, where I knew the water was deep. We tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs and flying leaves. The fusillade below stopped short, as I had foreseen it would when the squirts got empty. I threw my head back to a glinting whizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-hole and out at the other. Looking past that mad helmsman, who was shaking the empty rifle and yelling at the shore, I saw vague forms of men running bent double, leaping, gliding, distinct, incomplete, evanescent. Something big appeared in the air before the shutter, the rifle went overboard, and the man stepped back swiftly, looked at me over his shoulder in an extraordinary, profound, familiar manner, and fell upon my feet. The side of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what appeared a long cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp-stool. It",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,28,"looked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had lost his balance in the effort. The thin smoke had blown away, we were clear of the snag, and looking ahead I could see that in another hundred yards JOSEPH CONRAD 75 or so I would be free to sheer off, away from the bank; but my feet felt so very warm and wet that I had to look down. The man had rolled on his back and stared straight up at me; both his hands clutched that cane. It was the shaft of a spear that, either thrown or lunged through the opening, had caught him in the side just below the ribs; the blade had gone in out of sight, after making a frightful gash; my shoes were full; a pool of blood lay very still, gleaming dark-red under the wheel; his eyes shone with an amazing lustre. The fusillade burst out again. He looked at me anxiously, gripping the spear like something precious, with an air of being afraid I would try to take it away from him. I had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend to the steering. With one hand I felt above my head for the line of the steam whistle, and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly. The tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly, and then from the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight of the last hope from the earth. There was a great commotion in the bush; the shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping shots rang out sharplythen silence, in which the languid beat of the stern-wheel came plainly to my ears. I put the helm hard a-starboard at the moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very hot and agitated, appeared in the doorway. The manager sends me he began in an official tone, and stopped short. Good God! he said, glaring at the wounded man. We two whites stood over him, and his lustrous and inquiring glance enveloped us both. I declare it 76 HEART OF DARKNESS looked as though he would presently put to us some question in an understandable language; but he died without uttering a sound, without moving a limb, without twitching a muscle. Only in the very last moment, as though in response to some sign we could not see, to some whisper we could not hear, he frowned heavily, and that frown gave to his black death-mask an inconceivably sombre, brooding, and menacing expression. The lustre of inquiring glance faded swiftly into vacant glassiness. Can you steer? I asked the agent eagerly. He looked very dubious; but I made a grab at his arm, and he understood at once I meant him to steer whether or no. To tell you the truth, I was morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks. He immensely impressed. No doubt about it, said I, tugging like mad at the shoe-laces. And by the way, I suppose Mr. Kurtz is dead as well by this time. is dead, murmured the fellow, For the moment that was the dominant thought. There was a sense of extreme disappointment, as though I had found out I had been striving after something altogether without a substance. I couldnt have been more disgusted if I had travelled all this way for the sole purpose of talking with Mr. Kurtz. Talking with . . . I flung one shoe overboard, and became aware that that was exactly what I had been looking forward toa talk with Kurtz. I made the strange discovery that I had never imagined him as doing, you know, but as discoursing. I didnt say to myself, Now I will never see him, or Now I will never shake him by the hand, but, Now I will never hear him. The man presented himself as a voice. Not of course that I did not connect him with some sort of action. Hadnt I JOSEPH CONRAD 77 been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration that he had collected, bartered, swindled, or stolen more ivory than all the other agents together? That was not the point. The point was in his being a gifted creature, and that of all his gifts the one that stood out preminently, that carried with it a sense of real presence, was his ability to talk, his wordsthe gift of expression, the bewildering, the illuminating, the most exalted and the most contemptible, the pulsating stream of light, or the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable darkness. The other shoe went flying unto the devil-god of that river. I thought, By",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,29,"Jove! its all over. We are too late; he has vanishedthe gift has vanished, by means of some spear, arrow, or club. I will never hear that chap speak after alland my sorrow had a startling extravagance of emotion, even such as I had noticed in the howling sorrow of these savages in the bush. I couldnt have felt more of lonely desolation somehow, had I been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny in life. . . . Why do you sigh in this beastly way, somebody? Absurd? Well, absurd. Good Lord! mustnt a man ever Here, give me some tobacco. . . . There was a pause of profound stillness, then a match flared, and Marlows lean face appeared, worn, hollow, with downward folds and dropped eyelids, with an aspect of concentrated attention; and as he took vigorous draws at his pipe, it seemed to retreat and advance out of the night in the regular flicker of the tiny flame. The match went out. Absurd! he cried. This is the worst of trying to tell. . . . Here you all are, each moored with two good addresses, like a hulk with two anchors, a butcher 78 HEART OF DARKNESS round one corner, a policeman round another, excellent appetites, and temperature normalyou hearnormal from years end to years end. And you say, Absurd! Absurd beexploded! Absurd! My dear boys, what can you expect from a man who out of sheer nervousness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes! Now I think of it, it is amazing I did not shed tears. I am, upon the whole, proud of my fortitude. I was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the inestimable privilege of listening to the gifted Kurtz. Of course I was wrong. The privilege was waiting for me. Oh, yes, I heard more than enough. And I was right, too. A voice. He was very little more than a voice. And I heardhimitthis voiceother voicesall of them were so little more than voices and the memory of that time itself lingers around me, impalpable, like a dying vibration of one immense jabber, silly, atrocious, sordid, savage, or simply mean, without any kind of sense. Voices, voiceseven the girl herselfnow He was silent for a long time. I laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie, he began, suddenly. Girl! What? Did I mention a girl? Oh, she is out of itcompletely. Theythe women, I meanare out of itshould be out of it. We must help them to stay in that beautiful world of their own, lest ours gets worse. Oh, she had to be out of it. You should have heard the disinterred body of Mr. Kurtz saying, My Intended. You would have perceived directly then how completely she was out of it. And the lofty frontal bone of Mr. Kurtz! They say the hair goes on growing sometimes, but thisahspecimen, was impressively bald. The wilderness had patted him on JOSEPH CONRAD 79 the head, and, behold, it was like a ballan ivory ball; it had caressed him, andlo!he had withered; it had taken him, loved him, embraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish initiation. He was its spoiled and pampered favourite. Ivory? I should think so. Heaps of it, stacks of it. The old mud shanty was bursting with it. You would think there was not a single tusk left either above or below the ground in the whole country. Mostly fossil, the manager had remarked, disparagingly. It was no more fossil than I am; but they call it fossil when it is dug up. It appears these niggers do bury the tusks sometimesbut evidently they couldnt bury this parcel deep enough to save the gifted Mr. Kurtz from his fate. We filled the steamboat with it, and had to pile a lot on the deck. Thus he could see and enjoy as long as he could see, because the appreciation of this favour had remained with him to the last. You should have heard him say, My ivory. Oh, yes, I heard him. My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my everything belonged to him. It made me hold my breath in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places. Everything belonged to himbut that was a trifle. The thing was to know what he belonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own. That was the reflection that made you creepy all over. It was impossibleit was not good for one eithertrying to imagine. He had taken a high seat amongst",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,30,"the devils of the landI mean literally. You cant understand. How could you?with solid pavement under your feet, surrounded by kind 80 HEART OF DARKNESS region of little things make all neighbours ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping delicately between the butcher and the policeman, in the holy terror of scandal and gallows and lunatic asylumshow can you imagine what particular first ages a mans the untrammelled feet may take him into by the way of solitudeutter solitude without a policemanby the way of silenceutter silence, where no warning voice of a kind neighbour can be heard whispering of public the great opinion? These difference. When they are gone you must fall back upon your own innate strength, upon your own capacity for faithfulness. Of course you may be too much of a fool to go wrongtoo dull even to know you are being assaulted by the powers of darkness. I take it, no fool ever made a bargain for his soul with the devil: the fool is too much of a fool, or the devil too much of a devilI dont know which. Or you may be such a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and sounds. Then the earth for you is only a standing placeand whether to be like this is your loss or your gain I wont pretend to say. But most of us are neither one nor the other. The earth for us is a place to live in, where we must put up with sights, with sounds, with smells, too, by Jove!breathe dead hippo, so to speak, and not be contaminated. And there, dont you see? Your strength comes in, the faith in your ability for the digging of unostentatious holes to bury the stuff inyour power of devotion, not to yourself, but to an obscure, back-breaking business. And thats difficult enough. Mind, I am not trying to excuse or even explainI am trying to account to myself forfor JOSEPH CONRAD 81 for the International Society Mr. Kurtzfor the shade of Mr. Kurtz. This initiated wraith from the back of Nowhere honoured me with its amazing confidence before it vanished altogether. This was because it could speak English to me. The original Kurtz had been educated partly in England, andas he was good enough to say himselfhis sympathies were in the right place. His mother was half-English, his father was half-French. All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz; and by and by I learned that, most the appropriately, Suppression of Savage Customs had intrusted him with the making of a report, for its future guidance. And he had written it, too. Ive seen it. Ive read it. It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence, but too high- strung, I think. Seventeen pages of close writing he had found time for! But this must have been before hislet us saynerves, went wrong, and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending with unspeakable rites, whichas far as I reluctantly gathered from what I heard at various timeswere offered up to himdo you understand?to Mr. Kurtz himself. But it was a beautiful piece of writing. The opening paragraph, however, in the light of later information, strikes me now as ominous. He began with the argument that we whites, from the point of development we had arrived at, must necessarily appear to them [savages] in the nature of supernatural beingswe approach them with the might as of a deity, and so on, and so on. By the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good practically unbounded, etc., etc. From that point he soared and took me with him. The peroration was magnificent, though difficult to remember, you know. It gave me 82 HEART OF DARKNESS about forgotten the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an august Benevolence. It made me tingle with enthusiasm. This was the unbounded power of eloquenceof words of burning noble words. There were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases, unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page, scrawled evidently much later, in an unsteady hand, may be regarded as the exposition of a method. It was very simple, and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous and terrifying, like a flash of lightning in a serene sky: Exterminate all the brutes! The curious part was that he had that valuable all apparently postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense came to himself, he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of my pamphlet (he called it), as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career. I had full",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,31,"information about all these things, and, besides, as it turned out, I was to have the care of his memory. Ive done enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it, if I choose, for an everlasting rest in the dust-bin of progress, amongst all the sweepings and, figuratively speaking, all the dead cats of civilization. But then, you see, I cant choose. He wont be forgotten. Whatever he was, he was not common. He had the power to charm or frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his honour; he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter misgivings: he had one devoted friend at least, and he had conquered one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with self-seeking. No; I cant forget him, though I am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life JOSEPH CONRAD 83 we lost in getting to him. I missed my late helmsman awfullyI missed him even while his body was still lying in the pilot-house. Perhaps you will think it passing strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of sand in a black Sahara. Well, dont you see, he had done something, he had steered; for months I had him at my backa helpan instrument. It was a kind of partnership. He steered for meI had to look after him, I worried about his deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created, of which I only became aware when it was suddenly broken. And the intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt remains to this day in my memorylike a claim of distant kinship affirmed in a supreme moment. Poor fool! If he had only left that shutter alone. He had no restraint, no restraintjust like Kurtza tree swayed by the wind. As soon as I had put on a dry pair of slippers, I dragged him out, after first jerking the spear out of his side, which operation I confess I performed with my eyes shut tight. His heels leaped together over the little doorstep; his shoulders were pressed to my breast; I hugged him from behind desperately. Oh! he was heavy, heavy; heavier than any man on earth, I should imagine. Then without more ado I tipped him overboard. The current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of grass, and I saw the body roll over twice before I lost sight of it for ever. All the pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awning-deck about the pilot-house, chattering at each other like a flock of excited magpies, and there was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude. What they wanted to keep that body 84 HEART OF DARKNESS hanging about for I cant guess. Embalm it, maybe. But I had also heard another, and a very ominous, murmur on the deck below. My friends the wood- cutters were likewise scandalized, and with a better show of reasonthough I admit that the reason itself was quite inadmissible. Oh, quite! I had made up my mind that if my late helmsman was to be eaten, the fishes alone should have him. He had been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now he was dead he might have become a first-class temptation, and possibly cause some startling trouble. Besides, I was anxious to take the wheel, the man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business. This I did directly the simple funeral was over. We were going half-speed, keeping right in the middle of the stream, and I listened to the talk about me. They had given up Kurtz, they had given up the station; Kurtz was dead, and the station had been burntand so onand so on. The red-haired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that at least this poor Kurtz had been properly avenged. Say! We must have made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush. Eh? What do the think? Say? He positively danced, you bloodthirsty little gingery beggar. And he had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man! I could not help saying, You made a glorious lot of smoke, anyhow. I had seen, from the way the tops of the bushes rustled and flew, that almost all the shots had gone too high. You cant hit anything unless you take aim and fire from the shoulder; but these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes shut. The retreat, I maintainedand I was rightwas caused by the JOSEPH CONRAD 85 screeching of the steam whistle. Upon this they forgot Kurtz, and began to howl at me with indignant protests. The manager stood by the wheel murmuring",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,32,"confidentially about the necessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all events, when I saw in the distance a clearing on the riverside and the outlines of some sort of building. Whats this? I asked. He clapped his hands in wonder. The station! he cried. I edged in at once, still going half-speed. Through my glasses I saw the slope of a hill interspersed with rare trees and perfectly free from undergrowth. A long decaying building on the summit was half buried in the high grass; the large holes in the peaked roof gaped black from afar; the jungle and the woods made a background. There was no enclosure or fence of any kind; but there had been one apparently, for near the house half-a-dozen slim posts remained in a row, roughly trimmed, and with their upper ends ornamented with round carved balls. The rails, or whatever there had been between, had disappeared. Of course the forest surrounded all that. The river-bank was clear, and on the waterside I saw a white man under a hat like a cartwheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm. Examining the edge of the forest above and below, I was almost certain I could see movementshuman forms gliding here and there. I steamed past prudently, then stopped the engines and let her drift down. The man on the shore began to shout, urging us to land. We have been attacked, screamed the manager. I knowI know. Its all right, yelled back the other, as cheerful as you please. Come along. Its all right. I am glad. 86 HEART OF DARKNESS His aspect reminded me of something I had seensomething funny I had seen somewhere. As I manuvred to get alongside, I was asking myself, What does this fellow look like? Suddenly I got it. He looked like a harlequin. His clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown holland probably, but it was covered with patches all over, with bright patches, blue, red, and yellowpatches on the back, patches on the front, patches on elbows, on knees; coloured binding around his jacket, scarlet edging at the bottom of his trousers; and the sunshine made him look extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal, because you could see how beautifully all this patching had been done. A beardless, boyish face, very fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little blue eyes, smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance like sunshine and shadow on a wind- swept plain. Look out, captain! he cried; theres a snag lodged in here last night. What! Another snag? I confess I swore shamefully. I had nearly holed my cripple, to finish off that charming trip. The harlequin on the bank turned his little pug-nose up to me. You English? he asked, all smiles. Are you? I shouted from the wheel. The smiles vanished, and he shook his head as if sorry for my disappointment. Then he brightened up. Never mind! he cried encouragingly. Are we in time? I asked. He is up there, he replied, with a toss of the head up the hill, and becoming gloomy all of a sudden. His face was like the autumn sky, overcast one moment and bright the next. When the manager, escorted by the pilgrims, all of them armed to the teeth, had gone to the house this chap came on board. I say, I dont like this. These JOSEPH CONRAD 87 natives are in the bush, I said. He assured me earnestly it was all right. They are simple people, he added; well, I am glad you came. It took me all my time to keep them off. But you said it was all right, I cried. Oh, they meant no harm, he said; and as I stared he corrected himself, Not exactly. Then vivaciously, My faith, your pilot-house wants a clean- up! In the next breath he advised me to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in case of any trouble. One good screech will do more for you than all your rifles. They are simple people, he repeated. He rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me. He seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence, and actually hinted, laughing, that such was the case. Dont you talk with Mr. Kurtz? I said. You dont talk with that manyou listen to him, he exclaimed with severe exaltation. But now He waved his arm, and in the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost depths of despondency. In a moment he came up again with a jump, possessed himself of both my hands, shook them continuously, while he gabbled: Brother sailor . . . honour . . . pleasure . . .",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,33,"delight . . . introduce myself . . . Russian . . . son of an arch-priest . . . Government of Tambov . . . What? Tobacco! English tobacco; the excellent English tobacco! Now, thats brotherly. Smoke? Wheres a sailor that does not smoke? The pipe soothed him, and gradually I made out he had run away from school, had gone to sea in a Russian ship; ran away again; served some time in English ships; was now reconciled with the arch-priest. He made a point of that. But when one is young one must see things, gather experience, ideas; enlarge the 88 HEART OF DARKNESS mind. Here! I interrupted. You can never tell! Here I met Mr. Kurtz, he said, youthfully solemn and reproachful. I held my tongue after that. It appears he had persuaded a Dutch trading-house on the coast to fit him out with stores and goods, and had started for the interior with a light heart, and no more idea of what would happen to him than a baby. He had been wandering about that river for nearly two years alone, cut off from everybody and everything. I am not so young as I look. I am twenty-five, he said. At first old Van Shuyten would tell me to go to the devil, he narrated with keen enjoyment; but I stuck to him, and talked and talked, till at last he got afraid I would talk the hind-leg off his favourite dog, so he gave me some cheap things and a few guns, and told me he hoped he would never see my face again. Good old Dutchman, Van Shuyten. Ive sent him one small lot of ivory a year ago, so that he cant call me a little thief when I get back. I hope he got it. And for the rest I dont care. I had some wood stacked for you. That was my old house. Did you see? I gave him Towsons book. He made as though he would kiss me, but restrained himself. The only book I had left, and I thought I had lost it, he said, looking at it ecstatically. So many accidents happen to a man going about alone, you know. Canoes get upset sometimesand sometimes youve got to clear out so quick when the people get angry. He thumbed the pages. You made notes in Russian? I asked. He nodded. I thought they were written in cipher, I said. He laughed, then became serious. I had lots of trouble to keep these people off, he said. Did they want to kill you? I asked. Oh, no! he cried, and checked JOSEPH CONRAD 89 himself. Why did they attack us? I pursued. He hesitated, then said shamefacedly, They dont want him to go. Dont they? I said, curiously. He nodded a nod full of mystery and wisdom. I tell you, he cried, this man has enlarged my mind. He opened his arms wide, staring at me with his little blue eyes that were perfectly round. III enveloped his parti-coloured I looked at him, lost in astonishment. There he was before me, in motley, as though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes, enthusiastic, fabulous. His very existence was improbable, inexplicable, and altogether bewildering. He was an insoluble problem. It was inconceivable how he had existed, how he had succeeded in getting so far, how he had managed to remainwhy he did not instantly disappear. I went a little farther, he said, then still a little farthertill I had gone so far that I dont know how Ill ever get back. Never mind. Plenty time. I can manage. You take Kurtz away quickquickI tell you. The glamour of youth rags, his destitution, his loneliness, the essential desolation of his futile wanderings. For monthsfor yearshis life hadnt been worth a days purchase; and there he was gallantly, to all appearance indestructible solely by the virtue of his few years and of his unreflecting audacity. I was seduced into something like admirationlike envy. Glamour urged him on, glamour kept him unscathed. He surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but space to breathe in and to push on through. His need was to exist, and to move onwards at the greatest possible risk, and with a the absolutely pure, maximum of privation. If uncalculating, unpractical spirit of adventure had ever ruled a human being, it ruled this bepatched youth. I thoughtlessly alive, 90 JOSEPH CONRAD 91 almost envied him the possession of this modest and clear flame. It seemed to have consumed all thought of self so completely, that even while he was talking to you, you forgot that it was hethe man before your eyeswho had gone through these things. I did not envy him his devotion to Kurtz, though.",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,34,"He had not meditated over it. It came to him, and he accepted it with a sort of eager fatalism. I must say that to me it appeared about the most dangerous thing in every way he had come upon so far. They had come together unavoidably, like two ships becalmed near each other, and lay rubbing sides at last. I suppose Kurtz wanted an audience, because on a certain occasion, when encamped in the forest, they had talked all night, or more probably Kurtz had talked. We talked of everything, he said, quite transported at the recollection. I forgot there was such a thing as sleep. The night did not seem to last an hour. Everything! Everything! . . . Of love, too. Ah, he talked to you of love! I said, much amused. It isnt what you think, he cried, almost passionately. It was in general. He made me see thingsthings. He threw his arms up. We were on deck at the time, and the headman of my wood-cutters, lounging near by, turned upon him his heavy and glittering eyes. I looked around, and I dont know why, but I assure you that never, never before, did this land, this river, this jungle, the very arch of this blazing sky, appear to me so hopeless and so dark, so impenetrable to human thought, so pitiless to human weakness. And, ever since, you have been with him, of course? I said. On the contrary. It appears their intercourse had been very much broken by various causes. He had, as 92 HEART OF DARKNESS he informed me proudly, managed to nurse Kurtz through two illnesses (he alluded to it as you would to some risky feat), but as a rule Kurtz wandered alone, far in the depths of the forest. Very often coming to this station, I had to wait days and days before he would turn up, he said. Ah, it was worth waiting for!sometimes. What was he doing? exploring or what? I asked. Oh, yes, of course; he had discovered lots of villages, a lake, toohe did not know exactly in what direction; it was dangerous to inquire too much but mostly his expeditions had been for ivory. But he had no goods to trade with by that time, I objected. Theres a good lot of cartridges left even yet, he answered, looking away. To speak plainly, he raided the country, I said. He nodded. Not alone, surely! He muttered something about the villages round that lake. Kurtz got the tribe to follow him, did he? I suggested. He fidgeted a little. They adored him, he said. The tone of these words was so extraordinary that I looked at him searchingly. It was curious to see his mingled eagerness and reluctance to speak of Kurtz. The man filled his life, occupied his thoughts, swayed his emotions. What can you expect? he burst out; he came to them with thunder and lightning, you know and they had never seen anything like itand very terrible. He could be very terrible. You cant judge Mr. Kurtz as you would an ordinary man. No, no, no! Nowjust to give you an ideaI dont mind telling you, he wanted to shoot me, too, one daybut I dont judge him. Shoot you! I cried. What for? Well, I had a small lot of ivory the chief of that village near my house gave me. You see I used to shoot game for them. Well, he wanted it, and wouldnt hear reason. He JOSEPH CONRAD 93 declared he would shoot me unless I gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country, because he could do so, and had a fancy for it, and there was nothing on earth to prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased. And it was true, too. I gave him the ivory. What did I care! But I didnt clear out. No, no. I couldnt leave him. I had to be careful, of course, till we got friendly again for a time. He had his second illness then. Afterwards I had to keep out of the way; but I didnt mind. He was living for the most part in those villages on the lake. When he came down to the river, sometimes he would take to me, and sometimes it was better for me to be careful. This man suffered too much. He hated all this, and somehow he couldnt get away. When I had a chance I begged him to try and leave while there was time; I offered to go back with him. And he would say yes, and then he would remain; go off on another ivory hunt; disappear for weeks; forget himself amongst these peopleforget himself you know. Why! hes mad, I said.",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,35,"He protested indignantly. Mr. Kurtz couldnt be mad. If I had heard him talk, only two days ago, I wouldnt dare hint at such a thing. . . . I had taken up my binoculars while we talked, and was looking at the shore, sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and at the back of the house. The consciousness of there being people in that bush, so silent, so quietas silent and quiet as the ruined house on the hillmade me uneasy. There was no sign on the face of nature of this amazing tale that was not so much told as suggested to me in desolate exclamations, completed by shrugs, in interrupted phrases, in hints ending in deep sighs. The woods were unmoved, like a maskheavy, like the closed door of 94 HEART OF DARKNESS the intention a prisonthey looked with their air of hidden knowledge, of patient expectation, of unapproachable silence. The Russian was explaining to me that it was only lately that Mr. Kurtz had come down to the river, bringing along with him all the fighting men of that lake tribe. He had been absent for several months getting himself adored, I supposeand had come down unexpectedly, with to all appearance of making a raid either across the river or down stream. Evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of thewhat shall I say?less material aspirations. However he had got much worse suddenly. I heard he was lying helpless, and so I came uptook my chance, said the Russian. Oh, he is bad, very bad. I directed my glass to the house. There were no signs of life, but there was the ruined roof, the long mud wall peeping above the grass, with three little square window-holes, no two of the same size; all this brought within reach of my hand, as it were. And then I made a brusque movement, and one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the field of my glass. You remember I told you I had been struck at the distance by certain attempts at ornamentation, rather remarkable in the ruinous aspect of the place. Now I had suddenly a nearer view, and its first result was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow. Then I went carefully from post to post with my glass, and I saw my mistake. These round knobs were not ornamental but symbolic; they were expressive and puzzling, striking and disturbingfood for thought and also for the vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky; but at all events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend the pole. They JOSEPH CONRAD 95 would have been even more impressive, those heads on the stakes, if their faces had not been turned to the house. Only one, the first I had made out, was facing my way. I was not so shocked as you may think. The start back I had given was really nothing but a movement of surprise. I had expected to see a knob of wood there, you know. I returned deliberately to the first I had seenand there it was, black, dried, sunken, with closed eyelidsa head that seemed to sleep at the top of that pole, and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white line of the teeth, was smiling, too, smiling continuously at some endless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber. in lacked restraint that Mr. Kurtz I am not disclosing any trade secrets. In fact, the manager said afterwards that Mr. Kurtzs methods had ruined the district. I have no opinion on that point, but I want you clearly to understand that there was nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there. They only showed the gratification of his various lusts, that there was something wanting in himsome small matter which, when the pressing need arose, could not be found under his magnificent eloquence. Whether he knew of this deficiency himself I cant say. I think the knowledge came to him at lastonly at the very last. But the wilderness had found him out early, and had taken on him a terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion. I think it had whispered to him things about himself which he did not know, things of which he had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitudeand the whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating. It echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core. . . . I put down the glass, and 96 HEART OF DARKNESS the head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance. The admirer of Mr. Kurtz was",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,36,"a bit crestfallen. In a hurried, indistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take thesesay, symbolsdown. He was not afraid of the natives; they would not stir till Mr. Kurtz gave the word. His ascendancy was extra- ordinary. The camps of these people surrounded the place, and the chiefs came every day to see him. They would crawl. . . . I dont want to know anything of the ceremonies used when approaching Mr. Kurtz, I shouted. Curious, this feeling that came over me that such details would be more intolerable than those heads drying on the stakes under Mr. Kurtzs windows. After all, that was only a savage sight, while I seemed at one bound to have been transported into some lightless region of subtle horrors, where pure, uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief, being something that had a right to existobviouslyin the sunshine. The young man looked at me with surprise. I suppose it did not occur to him that Mr. Kurtz was no idol of mine. He forgot I hadnt heard any of these splendid monologues on, what was it? on love, justice, conduct of lifeor what not. If it had come to crawling before Mr. Kurtz, he crawled as much as the veriest savage of them all. I had no idea of the conditions, he said: these heads were the heads of rebels. I shocked him excessively by laughing. Rebels! What would be the next definition I was to hear? There had been enemies, criminals, workersand these were rebels. Those rebellious heads looked very subdued to me on their sticks. You dont know how such a life tries a man JOSEPH CONRAD 97 like Kurtz, cried Kurtzs last disciple. Well, and you? I said. I! I! I am a simple man. I have no great thoughts. I want nothing from anybody. How can you compare me to . . .? His feelings were too much for speech, and suddenly he broke down. I dont understand, he groaned. Ive been doing my best to keep him alive, and thats enough. I had no hand in all this. I have no abilities. There hasnt been a drop of medicine or a mouthful of invalid food for months here. He was shamefully abandoned. A man like this, with such ideas. Shamefully! Shamefully! II havent slept for the last ten nights. . . . His voice lost itself in the calm of the evening. The long shadows of the forest had slipped downhill while we talked, had gone far beyond the ruined hovel, beyond the symbolic row of stakes. All this was in the gloom, while we down there were yet in the sunshine, and the stretch of the river abreast of the clearing glittered in a still and dazzling splendour, with a murky and overshadowed bend above and below. Not a living soul was seen on the shore. The bushes did not rustle. Suddenly round the corner of the house a group of men appeared, as though they had come up from the ground. They waded waist-deep in the grass, in a compact body, bearing an improvised stretcher in their midst. Instantly, in the emptiness of the landscape, a cry arose whose shrillness pierced the still air like a sharp arrow flying straight to the very heart of the land; and, as if by enchantment, streams of human beingsof naked human beingswith spears in their hands, with bows, with shields, with wild glances and savage movements, were poured into the clearing by the dark-faced and pensive forest. The bushes shook, 98 HEART OF DARKNESS the grass swayed for a time, and then everything stood still in attentive immobility. Now, if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for, said the Russian at my elbow. The knot of men with the stretcher had stopped, too, halfway to the steamer, as if petrified. I saw the man on the stretcher sit up, lank and with an uplifted arm, above the shoulders of the bearers. Let us hope that the man who can talk so well of love in general will find some particular reason to spare us this time, I said. I resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation, as if to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a dishonouring necessity. I could not hear a sound, but through my glasses I saw the thin arm extended commandingly, the lower jaw moving, the eyes of that apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with grotesque jerks. Kurtz Kurtzthat means short in Germandont it? Well, the name was as true as everything else in his life and death. He looked at least seven feet long. His covering had fallen off, and his body",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,37,"emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from a winding-sheet. I could see the cage of his ribs all astir, the bones of his arm waving. It was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of dark and glittering bronze. I saw him open his mouth wideit gave him a weirdly voracious aspect, as though he had wanted to swallow all the air, all the earth, all the men before him. A deep voice reached me faintly. He must have been shouting. He fell back suddenly. The stretcher shook as the bearers staggered forward again, and almost at the same time I noticed JOSEPH CONRAD 99 that the crowd of savages was vanishing without any perceptible movement of retreat, as if the forest that had ejected these beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn in a long aspiration. thunderbolts of Some of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his armstwo shot-guns, a heavy rifle, and a light revolver-carbinethe that pitiful Jupiter. The manager bent over him murmuring as he walked beside his head. They laid him down in one of the little cabinsjust a room for a bed place and a camp-stool or two, you know. We had brought his belated correspondence, and a lot of torn envelopes and open letters littered his bed. His hand roamed feebly amongst these papers. I was struck by the fire of his eyes and the composed languor of his expression. It was not so much the exhaustion of disease. He did not seem in pain. This shadow looked satiated and calm, as though for the moment it had had its fill of all the emotions. He rustled one of the letters, and looking straight in my face said, I am glad. Somebody had been writing to him about me. These special recommendations were turning up again. The volume of tone he emitted without effort, almost without the trouble of moving his lips, amazed me. A voice! a voice! It was grave, profound, vibrating, while the man did not seem capable of a whisper. However, he had enough strength in himfactitious no doubtto very nearly make an end of us, as you shall hear directly. The manager appeared silently in the doorway; I stepped out at once and he drew the curtain after me. The Russian, eyed curiously by the pilgrims, was 100 HEART OF DARKNESS staring at the shore. I followed the direction of his glance. Dark human shapes could be made out in the distance, flitting indistinctly against the gloomy border of the forest, and near the river two bronze figures, leaning on tall spears, stood in the sunlight under fantastic head-dresses of spotted skins, warlike and still in statuesque repose. And from right to left along the lighted shore moved a wild and gorgeous apparition of a woman. She walked with measured steps, draped in striped and fringed cloths, treading the earth proudly, with a slight jingle and flash of barbarous ornaments. She carried her head high; her hair was done in the shape of a helmet; she had brass leggings to the knee, brass wire gauntlets to the elbow, a crimson spot on her tawny cheek, innumerable necklaces of glass beads on her neck; bizarre things, charms, gifts of witch-men, that hung about her, glittered and trembled at every step. She must have had the value of several elephant tusks upon her. She was savage and superb, wild-eyed and magnificent; there was something ominous and stately in her deliberate progress. And in the hush that had fallen suddenly upon the whole sorrowful land, the immense wilderness, the colossal body of the fecund and mysterious life seemed to look at her, pensive, as though it had been looking at the image of its own tenebrous and passionate soul. She came abreast of the steamer, stood still, and faced us. Her long shadow fell to the waters edge. Her face had a tragic and fierce aspect of wild sorrow and of dumb pain mingled with the fear of some struggling, half-shaped resolve. She stood looking at us without a JOSEPH CONRAD 101 stir, and like the wilderness itself, with an air of brooding over an inscrutable purpose. A whole minute passed, and then she made a step forward. There was a low jingle, a glint of yellow metal, a sway of fringed draperies, and she stopped as if her heart had failed her. The young fellow by my side growled. The pilgrims murmured at my back. She looked at us all as if her the unswerving steadiness of her glance. Suddenly she opened her bared arms and threw them up rigid above her head, as though in",no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,38,"an uncontrollable desire to touch the sky, and at the same time the swift shadows darted out on the earth, swept around on the river, gathering the steamer into a shadowy embrace. A formidable silence hung over the scene. life had depended upon She turned away slowly, walked on, following the bank, and passed into the bushes to the left. Once only her eyes gleamed back at us in the dusk of the thickets before she disappeared. If she had offered to come aboard I really think I would have tried to shoot her, said the man of patches, nervously. I have been risking my life every day for the last fortnight to keep her out of the house. She got in one day and kicked up a row about those miserable rags I picked up in the storeroom to mend my clothes with. I wasnt decent. At least it must have been that, for she talked like a fury to Kurtz for an hour, pointing at me now and then. I dont understand the dialect of this tribe. Luckily for me, I fancy Kurtz felt too ill that day to care, or there would have been mischief. I dont understand. . . . Noits too much for me. Ah, well, its all over now. 102 HEART OF DARKNESS At this moment I heard Kurtzs deep voice behind the curtain: Save me!save the ivory, you mean. Dont tell me. Save me! Why, Ive had to save you. You are interrupting my plans now. Sick! Sick! Not so sick as you would like to believe. Never mind. Ill carry my ideas out yetI will return. Ill show you what can be done. You with your little peddling notionsyou are interfering with me. I will return. I. . . . The manager came out. He did me the honour to take me under the arm and lead me aside. He is very low, very low, he said. He considered it necessary to sigh, but neglected to be consistently sorrowful. We have done all we could for himhavent we? But there is no disguising the fact, Mr. Kurtz has done more harm than good to the Company. He did not see the time was not ripe for vigorous action. Cautiously, cautiouslythats my principle. We must be cautious yet. The district is closed to us for a time. Deplorable! Upon the whole, the trade will suffer. I dont deny there is a remarkable quantity of ivorymostly fossil. We must save it, at all eventsbut look how precarious the position isand why? Because the method is unsound. Do you, said I, looking at the shore, call it unsound method? Without doubt, he exclaimed hotly. Dont you? . . . No method at all, I murmured after a while. Exactly, he exulted. I anticipated this. Shows a complete want of judgment. It is my duty to point it out in the proper quarter. Oh, said fellowwhats his name?the brickmaker, will make a readable report for you. He appeared confounded for a moment. It seemed to me I had never breathed an atmosphere so vile, and I turned that I, JOSEPH CONRAD 103 mentally to Kurtz for reliefpositively for relief. Nevertheless I think Mr. Kurtz is a remarkable man, I said with emphasis. He started, dropped on me a cold heavy glance, said very quietly, he was, and turned his back on me. My hour of favour was over; I found myself lumped along with Kurtz as a partisan of methods for which the time was not ripe: I was unsound! Ah! but it was something to have at least a choice of nightmares. I had turned to the wilderness really, not to Mr. Kurtz, who, I was ready to admit, was as good as buried. And for a moment it seemed to me as if I also were buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets. I felt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast, the smell of the damp earth, the unseen presence of victorious corruption, the darkness of an impenetrable night. . . . The Russian tapped me on the shoulder. I heard him mumbling and stammering something about brother seamancouldnt concealknowledge of matters that would affect Mr. Kurtzs reputation. I waited. For him evidently Mr. Kurtz was not in his grave; I suspect that for him Mr. Kurtz was one of the immortals. Well! said I at last, speak out. As it happens, I am Mr. Kurtzs friendin a way. the matter to himself without He stated with a good deal of formality that had we not been of the same profession, he would have kept to consequences. He suspected there was an active ill- will towards him on the part of these white men that You are right, I said, remembering a",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,39,"certain conversation I had overheard. The manager thinks you ought to be hanged. He showed a concern at this intelligence which amused me at first. I had better get regard 104 HEART OF DARKNESS out of the way quietly, he said, earnestly. I can do no more for Kurtz now, and they would soon find some excuse. Whats to stop them? Theres a military post three hundred miles from here. Well, upon my word, said I, perhaps you had better go if you have any friends amongst the savages near by. Plenty, he said. They are simple peopleand I want nothing, you know. He stood biting his lip, then: I dont want any harm to happen to these whites here, but of course I was thinking of Mr. Kurtzs reputationbut you are a brother seaman and All right, said I, after a time. Mr. Kurtzs reputation is safe with me. I did not know how truly I spoke. He informed me, lowering his voice, that it was Kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the steamer. He hated sometimes the idea of being taken awayand then again. . . . But I dont understand these matters. I am a simple man. He thought it would scare you awaythat you would give it up, thinking him dead. I could not stop him. Oh, I had an awful time of it this last month. Very well, I said. He is all right now. Ye-e-es, he muttered, not very convinced apparently. Thanks, said I; I shall keep my eyes open. But quieteh? he urged, anxiously. It would be awful for his reputation if anybody here I promised a complete discretion with great gravity. I have a canoe and three black fellows waiting not very far. I am off. Could you give me a few Martini-Henry cartridges? I could, and did, with proper secrecy. He helped himself, with a wink at me, to a handful of my tobacco. Between sailorsyou knowgood English tobacco. At the door of the pilot-house he turned roundI say, havent you a pair of shoes you could JOSEPH CONRAD 105 spare? He raised one leg. Look. The soles were tied with knotted strings sandal-wise under his bare feet. I rooted out an old pair, at which he looked with admiration before tucking it under his left arm. One of his pockets (bright red) was bulging with cartridges, from the other (dark blue) peeped Towsons Inquiry, etc., etc. He seemed to think himself excellently well equipped for a renewed encounter with the wilderness. Ah! Ill never, never meet such a man again. You ought to have heard him recite poetryhis own, too, it was, he told me. Poetry! He rolled his eyes at the recollection of these delights. Oh, he enlarged my mind! Good-bye, said I. He shook hands and vanished in the night. Sometimes I ask myself whether I had ever really seen himwhether it was possible to meet such a phenomenon! . . . When I woke up shortly after midnight his warning came to my mind with its hint of danger that seemed, in the starred darkness, real enough to make me get up for the purpose of having a look round. On the hill a big fire burned, illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the station-house. One of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks, armed for the purpose, was keeping guard over the ivory; but deep within the forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed to sink and rise from the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness, showed the exact position of the camp where Mr. Kurtzs adorers were keeping their uneasy vigil. The monotonous beating of a big drum filled the air with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration. A steady droning sound of many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from the black, flat wall of the 106 HEART OF DARKNESS woods as the humming of bees comes out of a hive, and had a strange narcotic effect upon my half-awake senses. I believe I dozed off leaning over the rail, till an abrupt burst of yells, an overwhelming outbreak of a pent-up and mysterious frenzy, woke me up in a bewildered wonder. It was cut short all at once, and the low droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence. I glanced casually into the little cabin. A light was burning within, but Mr. Kurtz was not there. I think I would have raised an outcry if I had believed my eyes. But I didnt believe them at first the thing seemed so impossible. The fact is I was completely unnerved by a sheer blank fright, pure abstract terror, unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger.",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no
Heart_Darkness,40,"What made this emotion so overpowering washow shall I define it?the moral shock I received, as if something altogether monstrous, intolerable to thought and odious to the soul, had been thrust upon me unexpectedly. This lasted of course the merest fraction of a second, and then the usual sense of commonplace, deadly danger, the possibility of a sudden onslaught and massacre, or something of the kind, which I saw impending, was positively welcome and composing. It pacified me, in fact, so much, that I did not raise an alarm. There was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster and sleeping on a chair on deck within three feet of me. The yells had not awakened him; he snored very slightly; I left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore. I did not betray Mr. Kurtzit was ordered I should never betray himit was written I should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice. I was anxious to deal with JOSEPH CONRAD 107 this shadow by myself aloneand to this day I dont know why I was so jealous of sharing with any one the peculiar blackness of that experience. As soon as I got on the bank I saw a traila broad trail through the grass. I remember the exultation with which I said to myself, He cant walkhe is crawling on all-foursIve got him. The grass was wet with dew. I strode rapidly with clenched fists. I fancy I had some vague notion of falling upon him and giving him a drubbing. I dont know. I had some imbecile thoughts. The knitting old woman with the cat obtruded herself upon my memory as a most improper person to be sitting at the other end of such an affair. I saw a row of pilgrims squirting lead in the air out of Winchesters held to the hip. I thought I would never get back to the steamer, and imagined myself living alone and unarmed in the woods to an advanced age. Such silly thingsyou know. And I remember I confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of my heart, and was pleased at its calm regularity. I kept to the track thoughthen stopped to listen. The night was very clear; a dark blue space, sparkling with dew and starlight, in which black things stood very still. I thought I could see a kind of motion ahead of me. I was strangely cocksure of everything that night. I actually left the track and ran in a wide semicircle (I verily believe chuckling to myself) so as to get in front of that stir, of that motion I had seenif indeed I had seen anything. I was circumventing Kurtz as though it had been a boyish game. I came upon him, and, if he had not heard me coming, I would have fallen over him, too, but he got up in time. He rose, unsteady, long, pale, indistinct, 108 HEART OF DARKNESS like a vapour exhaled by the earth, and swayed slightly, misty and silent before me; while at my back the fires loomed between the trees, and the murmur of many voices issued from the forest. I had cut him off cleverly; but when actually confronting him I seemed to come to my senses, I saw the danger in its right proportion. It was by no means over yet. Suppose he began to shout? Though he could hardly stand, there was still plenty of vigour in his voice. Go awayhide yourself, he said, in that profound tone. It was very awful. I glanced back. We were within thirty yards from the nearest fire. A black figure stood up, strode on long black legs, waving long black arms, across the glow. It had hornsantelope horns, I thinkon its head. Some sorcerer, some witch-man, no doubt: it looked fiendlike enough. Do you know what you are doing? I whispered. Perfectly, he answered, raising his voice for that single word: it sounded to me far off and yet loud, like a hail through a speaking-trumpet. If he makes a row we are lost, I thought to myself. This clearly was not a case for fisticuffs, even apart from the very natural aversion I had to beat that Shadow this wandering and tormented thing. You will be lost, I saidutterly lost. One gets sometimes such a flash of inspiration, you know. I did say the right thing, though indeed he could not have been more irretrievably lost than he was at this very moment, when the foundations of our intimacy were being laidto endureto endureeven to the endeven beyond. I had immense plans, he muttered irresolutely. Yes, said I; but if you try to shout Ill smash your head with There was not a stick or a stone near.

Heart_Darkness,41,"109 will throttle you for good, I corrected myself. I was on the threshold of great things, he pleaded, in a voice of longing, with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold. And now for this stupid scoundrel Your success in Europe is assured in any case, I affirmed, steadily. I did not want to have the throttling of him, you understandand indeed it would have been very little use for any practical purpose. I tried to break the the spellthe heavy, mute spell of wildernessthat seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of gratified and monstrous passions. This alone, I was convinced, had driven him out to the edge of the forest, to the bush, towards the gleam of fires, the throb of drums, the drone of weird incantations; this alone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted aspirations. And, dont you see, the terror of the position was not in being knocked on the headthough I had a very lively sense of that danger, toobut in this, that I had to deal with a being to whom I could not appeal in the name of anything high or low. I had, even like the niggers, to invoke himhimselfhis own exalted and incredible degradation. There was nothing either above or below him, and I knew it. He had kicked himself loose of the earth. Confound the man! he had kicked the very earth to pieces. He was alone, and I before him did not know whether I stood on the ground or floated in the air. Ive been telling you what we saidrepeating the phrases we pronouncedbut whats the good? They were common everyday wordsthe familiar, vague sounds exchanged on every waking day of life. But what of that? They had behind them, to my mind, the terrific 110 HEART OF DARKNESS suggestiveness of words heard in dreams, of phrases spoken in nightmares. Soul! If anybody had ever struggled with a soul, I am the man. And I wasnt arguing with a lunatic either. Believe me or not, his intelligence was perfectly clearconcentrated, it is true, upon himself with horrible intensity, yet clear; and therein was my only chancebarring, of course, the killing him there and then, which wasnt so good, on account of unavoidable noise. But his soul was mad. Being alone in the wilderness, it had looked within itself, and, by heavens! I tell you, it had gone mad. I hadfor my sins, I supposeto go through the ordeal of looking into it myself. No eloquence could have been so withering to ones belief in mankind as his final burst of sincerity. He struggled with himself, too. I saw itI heard it. I saw the inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint, no faith, and no fear, yet struggling blindly with itself. I kept my head pretty well; but when I had him at last stretched on the couch, I wiped my forehead, while my legs shook under me as though I had carried half a ton on my back down that hill. And yet I had only supported him, his bony arm clasped round my neckand he was not much heavier than a child. When next day we left at noon, the crowd, of whose presence behind the curtain of trees I had been acutely conscious all the time, flowed out of the woods again, filled the clearing, covered the slope with a mass of naked, breathing, quivering, bronze bodies. I steamed up a bit, then swung down stream, and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of the splashing, thumping, fierce river-demon beating the water with its terrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air. In JOSEPH CONRAD 111 front of the first rank, along the river, three men, plastered with bright red earth from head to foot, strutted to and fro restlessly. When we came abreast again, they faced the river, stamped their feet, nodded their horned heads, swayed their scarlet bodies; they shook towards the fierce river-demon a bunch of black feathers, a mangy skin with a pendent tailsomething that they shouted like a dried gourd; periodically together strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds of human language; and the deep murmurs of the crowd, interrupted suddenly, were like the responses of some satanic litany. looked We had carried Kurtz into the pilot-house: there was more air there. Lying on the couch, he stared through the open shutter. There was an eddy in the mass of human bodies, and the woman with helmeted head and tawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream. She put out her hands, shouted something, and all that wild mob took up the shout",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,42,"in a roaring chorus of articulated, rapid, breathless utterance. Do you understand this? I asked. He kept on looking out past me with fiery, longing eyes, with a mingled expression of wistfulness and hate. He made no answer, but I saw a smile, a smile of indefinable meaning, appear on his colourless lips that a moment after twitched convulsively. Do I not? he said slowly, gasping, as if the words had been torn out of him by a supernatural power. I pulled the string of the whistle, and I did this because I saw the pilgrims on deck getting out their rifles with an air of anticipating a jolly lark. At the sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror through that wedged mass of bodies. Dont! dont you 112 HEART OF DARKNESS frighten them away, cried some one on deck disconsolately. I pulled the string time after time. They broke and ran, they leaped, they crouched, they swerved, they dodged the flying terror of the sound. The three red chaps had fallen flat, face down on the shore, as though they had been shot dead. Only the barbarous and superb woman did not so much as flinch, and stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the sombre and glittering river. And then that imbecile crowd down on the deck started their little fun, and I could see nothing more for smoke. The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress; and Kurtzs life was running swiftly, too, ebbing, ebbing out of his heart into the sea of inexorable time. The manager was very placid, he had no vital anxieties now, he took us both in with a comprehensive and satisfied glance: the affair had come off as well as could be wished. I saw the time approaching when I would be left alone of the party of unsound method. The pilgrims looked upon me with disfavour. I was, so to speak, numbered with the dead. It is strange how I accepted this unforeseen partnership, this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the tenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phantoms. Kurtz discoursed. A voice! a voice! It rang deep to the very last. It survived his strength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the barren darkness of his heart. Oh, he struggled! he struggled! The wastes of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy images revolving nowimages of wealth fame and JOSEPH CONRAD 113 obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of noble and lofty expression. My Intended, my station, my career, my ideasthese were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated sentiments. The shade of the original Kurtz frequented the bedside of the hollow sham, whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mould of primeval earth. But both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of the mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that soul satiated with primitive emotions, avid of lying fame, of sham distinction, of all the appearances of success and power. Sometimes he was contemptibly childish. He desired to have kings meet him at railway-stations on his return from some ghastly Nowhere, where he intended to accomplish great things. You show them you have in you something that is really profitable, and then there will be no limits to the recognition of your ability, he would say. Of course you must take care of the motivesright motivesalways. The long reaches that were like one and the same reach, monotonous bends that were exactly alike, slipped past the steamer with their multitude of secular trees looking patiently after this grimy fragment of another world, the forerunner of change, of conquest, of trade, of massacres, of blessings. I looked aheadpiloting. Close the shutter, said Kurtz suddenly one day; I cant bear to look at this. I did so. There was a silence. Oh, but I will wring your heart yet! he cried at the invisible wilderness. We broke downas I had expectedand had to lie up for repairs at the head of an island. This delay was the first thing that shook Kurtzs confidence. One 114 HEART OF DARKNESS morning he gave me a packet of papers and a photographthe lot tied together with a shoe-string. Keep this for me, he said. This noxious fool (meaning the manager) is capable of prying into my boxes when I am not looking. In the afternoon I saw him. He was lying on his back with closed eyes, and I withdrew quietly, but I heard him mutter, Live rightly, die, die . . . I listened. There was nothing more. Was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep, or was it a fragment",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,43,"of a phrase from some newspaper article? He had been writing for the papers and meant to do so again, for the furthering of my ideas. Its a duty. His was an impenetrable darkness. I looked at him as you peer down at a man who is lying at the bottom of a precipice where the sun never shines. But I had not much time to give him, because I was helping the engine-driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders, to straighten a bent connecting-rod, and in other such matters. I lived in an infernal mess of rust, filings, nuts, bolts, spanners, hammers, ratchet-drillsthings I abominate, because I dont get on with them. I tended the little forge we fortunately had aboard; I toiled wearily in a wretched scrap-heapunless I had the shakes too bad to stand. One evening coming in with a candle I was startled to hear him say a little tremulously, I am lying here in the dark waiting for death. The light was within a foot of his eyes. I forced myself to murmur, Oh, nonsense! and stood over him as if transfixed. Anything approaching the change that came over his features I have never seen before, and hope never to see again. Oh, I wasnt touched. I was fascinated. It was as though a veil had been rent. I saw on that ivory JOSEPH CONRAD 115 face the expression of sombre pride, of ruthless power, of craven terrorof an intense and hopeless despair. Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at some visionhe cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath The horror! The horror! I blew the candle out and left the cabin. The pilgrims were dining in the mess-room, and I took my place opposite the manager, who lifted his eyes to give me a questioning glance, which I successfully ignored. He leaned back, serene, with that peculiar smile of his sealing the unexpressed depths of his meanness. A continuous shower of small flies streamed upon the lamp, upon the cloth, upon our hands and faces. Suddenly the managers boy put his insolent black head in the doorway, and said in a tone of scathing contempt Mistah Kurtzhe dead. All the pilgrims rushed out to see. I remained, and went on with my dinner. I believe I was considered brutally callous. However, I did not eat much. There was a lamp in therelight, dont you knowand outside it was so beastly, beastly dark. I went no more near the remarkable man who had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this earth. The voice was gone. What else had been there? But I am of course aware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a muddy hole. And then they very nearly buried me. However, as you see, I did not go to join Kurtz there and then. I did not. I remained to dream the 116 HEART OF DARKNESS nightmare out to the end, and to show my loyalty to Kurtz once more. Destiny. My destiny! Droll thing life isthat mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose. The most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourselfthat comes too latea crop of unextinguishable regrets. I have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place in an impalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without clamour, without glory, without the great desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid scepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary. If such is the form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be. I was within a hairs breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably I would have nothing to say. This is the reason why I affirm that Kurtz was a remarkable man. He had something to say. He said it. Since I had peeped over the edge myself, I understand better the meaning of his stare, that could not see the flame of the candle, but was wide enough to embrace the whole universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the darkness. He had summed uphe had judged. The horror! He was a remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of some sort of belief; it had candour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truththe strange commingling of",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,44,"desire and hate. And it is not my own extremity I remember besta vision of greyness without form filled with the physical pain, and a careless contempt for JOSEPH CONRAD 117 are just into sincerity, compressed evanescence of all thingseven of this pain itself. No! It is his extremity that I seem to have lived through. True, he had made that last stride, he had stepped over the edge, while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot. And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the wisdom, and all truth, and all that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible. Perhaps! I like to think my summing-up would not have been a word of careless contempt. Better his crymuch better. It was an affirmation, a moral victory paid for by innumerable terrors, by abominable defeats, by abominable satisfactions. But it was a victory! That is why I have remained loyal to Kurtz to the last, and even beyond, when a long time after I heard once more, not his own voice, but the echo of his magnificent eloquence thrown to me from a soul as translucently pure as a cliff of crystal. No, they did not bury me, though there is a period of time which I remember mistily, with a shuddering wonder, like a passage through some inconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire. I found myself back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying through the streets to filch a little money from each other, to devour their infamous cookery, unwholesome beer, to dream their insignificant and silly dreams. They trespassed upon my thoughts. They were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretence, because I felt so sure they could not possibly know the things I knew. Their bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals to gulp their 118 HEART OF DARKNESS going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety, was offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of a danger it is unable to comprehend. I had no particular desire to enlighten them, but I had some difficulty in restraining myself from laughing in their faces, so full of stupid importance. I daresay I was not very well at that time. I tottered about the streetsthere were various affairs to settlegrinning bitterly at perfectly respectable persons. I admit my behaviour was inexcusable, but then my temperature was seldom normal in these days. My dear aunts endeavours to nurse up my strength seemed altogether beside the mark. It was not my strength that wanted nursing, it was my imagination that wanted soothing. I kept the bundle of papers given me by Kurtz, not knowing exactly what to do with it. His mother had died lately, watched over, as I was told, by his Intended. A clean-shaved man, with an official manner and wearing gold-rimmed spectacles, called on me one day and made inquiries, at first circuitous, afterwards suavely pressing, about what he was pleased to denominate certain documents. I was not surprised, because I had had two rows with the manager on the subject out there. I had refused to give up the smallest scrap out of that package, and I took the same attitude with the spectacled man. He became darkly menacing at last, and with much heat argued that the Company had the right to every bit of information about its territories. And said he, Mr. Kurtzs knowledge of unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive and peculiarowing to his great abilities and to the deplorable circumstances in which he had been placed: therefore I assured him JOSEPH CONRAD 119 of the upon commerce the report on Mr. Kurtzs knowledge, however extensive, did not or problems bear administration. He invoked then the name of science. It would be an incalculable loss if, etc., etc. I offered him the Suppression of Savage Customs, with the postscriptum torn off. He took it up eagerly, but ended by sniffing at it with an air of contempt. This is not what we had a right to expect, he remarked. Expect nothing else, I said. There are only private letters. He withdrew upon some threat of legal proceedings, and I saw him no more; but another fellow, calling himself Kurtzs cousin, appeared two days later, and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear relatives last moments. Incidentally he gave me to understand that Kurtz had been essentially a great musician. There was the making of an immense success, said the man, who was an organist, I believe, with lank grey hair flowing over a greasy coat-collar. I had no reason to doubt his statement; and to",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,45,"this day I am unable to say what was Kurtzs profession, whether he ever had anywhich was the greatest of his talents. I had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers, or else for a journalist who could paintbut even the cousin (who took snuff during the interview) could not tell me what he had beenexactly. He was a universal geniuson that point I agreed with the old chap, who thereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and withdrew in senile agitation, bearing off some family letters and memoranda without importance. Ultimately a journalist anxious to know something of the fate of his dear colleague turned up. This visitor informed me Kurtzs proper sphere ought to have been politics on the popular side. He had 120 HEART OF DARKNESS furry straight eyebrows, bristly hair cropped short, an eyeglass on a broad ribbon, and, becoming expansive, confessed his opinion that Kurtz really couldnt write a bitbut heavens! how that man could talk. He electrified large meetings. He had faithdont you see?he had the faith. He could get himself to believe anythinganything. He would have been a splendid leader of an extreme party. What party? I asked. Any party, answered the other. He was anan extremist. Did I not think so? I assented. Did I know, he asked, with a sudden flash of curiosity, what it was that had induced him to go out there? Yes, said I, and forthwith handed him the famous Report for publication, if he thought fit. He glanced through it hurriedly, mumbling all the time, judged it would do, and took himself off with this plunder. Thus I was left at last with a slim packet of letters and the girls portrait. She struck me as beautifulI mean she had a beautiful expression. I know that the sunlight can be made to lie, too, yet one felt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the delicate shade of truthfulness upon those features. She seemed ready to listen without mental reservation, without suspicion, without a thought for herself. I concluded I would go and give her back her portrait and those letters myself. Curiosity? Yes; and also some other feeling perhaps. All that had been Kurtzs had passed out of my hands: his soul, his body, his station, his plans, his ivory, his career. There remained only his memory and his Intendedand I wanted to give that up, too, to the past, in a wayto surrender personally all that remained of him with me to that oblivion which is the last word of our common JOSEPH CONRAD 121 fate. I dont defend myself. I had no clear perception of what it was I really wanted. Perhaps it was an impulse of unconscious loyalty, or the fulfilment of one of those ironic necessities that lurk in the facts of human existence. I dont know. I cant tell. But I went. I thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that accumulate in every mans lifea vague impress on the brain of shadows that had fallen on it in their swift and final passage; but before the high and ponderous door, between the tall houses of a street as still and decorous as a well-kept alley in a cemetery, I had a vision of him on the stretcher, opening his mouth voraciously, as if to devour all the earth with all its mankind. He lived then before me; he lived as much as he had ever liveda shadow insatiable of splendid appearances, of frightful realities; a shadow darker than the shadow of the night, and draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence. The vision seemed to enter the house with methe stretcher, the phantom-bearers, the wild crowd of obedient worshippers, the gloom of the forests, the glitter of the reach between the murky bends, the beat of the drum, regular and muffled like the beating of a heartthe heart of a conquering darkness. It was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an invading and vengeful rush which, it seemed to me, I would have to keep back alone for the salvation of another soul. And the memory of what I had heard him say afar there, with the horned shapes stirring at my back, in the glow of fires, within the patient woods, those broken phrases came back to me, were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity. I remembered his abject pleading, his abject threats, the colossal scale of his 122 HEART OF DARKNESS the torment, the meanness, vile desires, the tempestuous anguish of his soul. And later on I seemed to see his collected languid manner, when he said one day, This lot of ivory now is really mine. The Company did",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
Heart_Darkness,46,"not pay for it. I collected it myself at a very great personal risk. I am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs though. Hm. It is a difficult case. What do you think I ought to doresist? Eh? I want no more than justice. . . . He wanted no more than justiceno more than justice. I rang the bell before a mahogany door on the first floor, and while I waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panelstare immense stare embracing, with condemning, loathing all the universe. I seemed to hear the whispered cry, The horror! The horror! that wide and The dusk was falling. I had to wait in a lofty drawing-room with three long windows from floor to ceiling that were like three luminous and bedraped columns. The bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture shone in indistinct curves. The tall marble fireplace had a cold and monumental whiteness. A grand piano stood massively in a corner; with dark gleams on the flat surfaces like a sombre and polished sarcophagus. A high door openedclosed. I rose. She came forward, all in black, with a pale head, floating towards me in the dusk. She was in mourning. It was more than a year since his death, more than a year since the news came; she seemed as though she would remember and mourn for ever. She took both my hands in hers and murmured, I had heard you were coming. I noticed she was not very youngI mean not girlish. She had a mature capacity for fidelity, for belief, for suffering. The room seemed to have grown JOSEPH CONRAD 123 darker, as if all the sad light of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her forehead. This fair hair, this pale visage, this pure brow, seemed surrounded by an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me. Their glance was guileless, profound, confident, and trustful. She carried her sorrowful head as though she were proud of that sorrow, as though she would say, II alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves. But while we were still shaking hands, such a look of awful desolation came upon her face that I perceived she was one of those creatures that are not the playthings of Time. For her he had died only yesterday. And, by Jove! the impression was so powerful that for me, too, he seemed to have died only yesterdaynay, this very minute. I saw her and him in the same instant of timehis death and her sorrowI saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death. Do you understand? I saw them togetherI heard them together. She had said, with a deep catch of the breath, I have survived while my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly, mingled with her tone of despairing regret, the summing up whisper of his eternal condemnation. I asked myself what I was doing there, with a sensation of panic in my heart as though I had blundered into a place of cruel and absurd mysteries not fit for a human being to behold. She motioned me to a chair. We sat down. I laid the packet gently on the little table, and she put her hand over it. . . . You knew him well, she murmured, after a moment of mourning silence. Intimacy grows quickly out there, I said. I knew him as well as it is possible for one man to know another. 124 HEART OF DARKNESS And you admired him, she said. It was impossible to know him and not to admire him. Was it? He was a remarkable man, I said, unsteadily. Then before the appealing fixity of her gaze, that seemed to watch for more words on my lips, I went on, It was impossible not to Love him, she finished eagerly, silencing me into an appalled dumbness. How true! how true! But when you think that no one knew him so well as I! I had all his noble confidence. I knew him best. You knew him best, I repeated. And perhaps she did. But with every word spoken the room was growing darker, and only her forehead, smooth and white, remained illumined by the unextinguishable light of belief and love. You were his friend, she went on. His friend, she repeated, a little louder. You must have been, if he had given you this, and sent you to me. I feel I can speak to youand oh! I must speak. I want youyou who have heard his last wordsto know I have been worthy of him. . . . It is not pride. . . . Yes!

Heart_Darkness,47,"one on earthhe told me so himself. And since his mother died I have had no oneno onetoto I listened. The darkness deepened. I was not even sure whether he had given me the right bundle. I rather suspect he wanted me to take care of another batch of his papers which, after his death, I saw the manager examining under the lamp. And the girl talked, easing her pain in the certitude of my sympathy; she talked as thirsty men drink. I had heard that her engagement with Kurtz had been disapproved JOSEPH CONRAD 125 by her people. He wasnt rich enough or something. And indeed I dont know whether he had not been a pauper all his life. He had given me some reason to infer that it was his impatience of comparative poverty that drove him out there. . . . Who was not his friend who had heard him speak once? she was saying. He drew men towards him by what was best in them. She looked at me with intensity. It is the gift of the great, she went on, and the sound of her low voice seemed to have the accompaniment of all the other sounds, full of mystery, desolation, and sorrow, I had ever heardthe ripple of the river, the soughing of the trees swayed by the wind, the murmurs of the faint ring of the crowds, incomprehensible words cried from afar, the whisper of a voice speaking from beyond the threshold of an eternal darkness. But you have heard him! You know! she cried. Yes, I know, I said with something like despair in my heart, but bowing my head before the faith that was in her, before that great and saving illusion that shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness, in the triumphant darkness from which I could not have defended herfrom which I could not even defend myself. What a loss to meto us!she corrected herself with beautiful generosity; then added in a murmur, To the world. By the last gleams of twilight I could see the glitter of her eyes, full of tearsof tears that would not fall. I have been very happyvery fortunatevery proud, she went on. Too fortunate. Too happy for a little while. And now I am unhappy forfor life. 126 HEART OF DARKNESS She stood up; her fair hair seemed to catch all the remaining light in a glimmer of gold. I rose, too. And of all this, she went on, mournfully, of all his promise, and of all his greatness, of his generous mind, of his noble heart, nothing remainsnothing but a memory. You and I We shall always remember him, I said, hastily. No! she cried. It is impossible that all this should be lostthat such a life should be sacrificed to leave nothingbut sorrow. You know what vast plans he had. I knew of them, tooI could not perhaps understandbut others knew of them. Something must remain. His words, at least, have not died. His words will remain, I said. And his example, she whispered to herself. Men looked up to himhis goodness shone in every act. His example True, I said; his example, too. Yes, his example. I forgot that. But I do not. I cannotI cannot believenot yet. I cannot believe that I shall never see him again, that nobody will see him again, never, never, never. She put out her arms as if after a retreating figure, stretching them back and with clasped pale hands across the fading and narrow sheen of the window. Never see him! I saw him clearly enough then. I shall see this eloquent phantom as long as I live, and I shall see her, too, a tragic and familiar Shade, resembling in this gesture another one, tragic also, and bedecked with powerless charms, stretching bare brown arms over the glitter of the infernal stream, the stream of darkness. She said suddenly very low, He died as he lived. JOSEPH CONRAD 127 His end, said I, with dull anger stirring in me, was in every way worthy of his life. And I was not with him, she murmured. My anger subsided before a feeling of infinite pity. Everything that could be done I mumbled. Ah, but I believed in him more than any one on earthmore than his own mother, more than himself. He needed me! Me! I would have treasured every sigh, every word, every sign, every glance. I felt like a chill grip on my chest. Dont, I said, in a muffled voice. Forgive me. IIhave mourned so long in silencein silence. . . . You were with himto the last? I think of his loneliness. Nobody near to understand him as I would have understood. Perhaps no one to hear. .",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes

I wantI wantsomethingsomethingto to live with. I was on the point of crying at her, Dont you hear them? The dusk was repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us, in a whisper that seemed to swell menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind. The horror! The horror! His last wordto live with, she insisted. Dont you understand I loved himI loved himI loved him! I pulled myself together and spoke slowly.

color out of space,0,"Kieran Setiya THE COLOUR OUT OF SPACE: LOVECRAFT ON INDUCTION Abstract. The problem of induction is affective as well as epistemic: how ought we to feel about the limits of human cognition? This ques- tion is pursued through H. P. Lovecrafts 1927 short story, The Colour Out of Space. Lovecraft explores the meaning of our epistemic frailty, drawing on George Santayanas Scepticism and Animal Faith. His narrative elicits inductive vertigo, the fear that our concepts fail to carve nature at the joints. We owe the skeptical problem of induction to David Hume. How do we know that regularities in nature will persist? That observa- tion is a guide to the unobserved? To reason inductively is to infer that properties correlated in the past will be correlated in the future. Both ordinary life and scientific inquiry depend on that assumption. Hume warns us that it may not hold: The bread, which I formerly eat [sic], nourished me; that is, a body with such sensible qualities, was, at that time, endued with such secret powers: But does it follow, that other bread must also nourish me at another time, and that like sensible quali- ties must always be attended with like secret powers? The consequence seems nowise necessary.1 That patterns project from what we have observed to what we have not is a contingent fact; we can imagine otherwise. To engage in inductive reasoning is to discount that imagining, to proceed upon the supposi- tion, that the future will be conformable to the past (Hume, p. 23). What warrants that presumption? It is not something we know a priori, independent of experience, as we know the necessary truths of logic or mathematics. If it happens to be true, it is an empirical fact. But Philosophy and Literature, 2021, 45: 3954. 2021 Johns Hopkins University Press. 40 Philosophy and Literature to argue for the premise on inductive groundssince induction has worked before, it will work againmust evidently be going in a circle, and taking that for granted, which is the very point in question (p. 23). Thus the epistemic problem of induction. Unless we are entitled to believe that the future will resemble the past, we are not justified in our use of inductive reasoning. But the only credible source of such entitle- ment is induction. It follows that we have no right to reason inductively: the foundations of science and of ordinary life collapse. The curious thing about Hume is that he never contemplates this conclusion. He placidly allows that the one proposition [about the future] may justly be inferred from the other [about the past] and that these [are] reasonings, on which almost all knowledge depends (Hume, pp. 22, 27). In fact, Hume does not see an epistemic problem. Readers have been misled by his insistence that inductive conclusions are not founded on reasoning, or any process of the understanding (p. 21). Hume means that they are not products of demonstrative proof or reasoning, not that they are unjustified. His topic is not our entitle- ment to inductive inference but its psychology.2 He denies that induction is the province of demonstration: this would require the supposition that leads us in a circle. Since it is not demonstrative, induction needs no similar assumption. Inductive reasoning is the product of habitual association or conditioning. Having eaten bread before, I associate the look and smell of bread with the satisfaction of hunger and so expect to be nourished again. While he calls this a sceptical solution, Hume never doubts the the authority of experience . . . that great guide to human life (p. 23). For Hume, then, the skeptical problem of induction is neither skepti- cal nor a problem. The surprise is not that he questions our inductive knowledge, about which he is perfectly complacent, but that he comes so close to an epistemic puzzle that has troubled subsequent philoso- phersby what right do we discount the possibility that the future will not resemble the past?only to be indifferent to it. Hume is oddly sanguine about the idea that scientific knowledge rests on mere facts of human psychology, on how we happen to project from past to future. He does not seem to think this tendency calls for justification or to worry that our tendencies may differ. Instead, he offers a mundane account of the mechanics of induction that appeals to custom and habit. As Nelson Goodman would observe, two centuries later: Humes answer to the question how predictions are related to past experience is refreshingly non-cosmic.3 Kieran Setiya 41 Humes complacency provides a context for the cosmic vision of H. P. Lovecraft. Lovecrafts synthesis of horror and science fiction has been read as an allegory of his metaphysics: of mechanistic materialism, the denial of purpose or teleology, and the insignificance of humankind",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
color out of space,1,"in a vast, indifferent cosmos.4 Lovecraft had a serious interest in phi- losophy, from Democritus and Lucretius through Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche to Bertrand Russell. Yet, according to S. T. Joshi, the leading authority on Lovecraft, Epistemology was the weakest area of his philosophical thought, simply because he did not pay much attention to it.5 Did Lovecraft share in Humes complacency? Yes and no. Like Hume, he did not question the authority of induction or its power to yield probable conclusions. Unlike Hume, he was alarmed by its contingency, by the fact that it could fail and by the ways in which it rests upon the accidents of human nature. Beside the epistemic problem of induction is the existential problem of how to feel about the vulnerability of our epistemic estate: a problem most philosophers neglect. This problem inspired one of Lovecrafts most powerful stories, The Colour Out of Space, a window on the affective world of our inductive frailty.6 There is no evidence that Lovecraft read Hume, though he might have done so (IAP, p. 318). A more plausible source for his episte- mology is the work of George Santayana, whom he called, in a letter, the greatest living philosopher (who is a poet as well).7 At the time, Lovecrafts judgment would not have seemed eccentric. Will Durants 1926 bestseller, The Story of Philosophy, which Lovecraft knew, ranked Santayana with John Dewey and William James among the giants of American philosophy.8 Lovecraft advised his correspondent to [begin] with his Scepticism & Animal Faith, which was published in 1923, the year in which Lovecraft first cites Santayana, in his presidents message to the National Amateur Press Association.9 In Scepticism and Animal Faith, Santayana presents an epistemology not unlike Humes.10 If we confine ourselves to what is demonstrable or certain, we are left with nothing; in that sense, the skeptic is right. Knowledge of material objects, of the future, even of ourselves, depends on animal faith, an adaptive pro- pensity to go beyond what is given to us: to assume a material world; to infer that bread will nourish us because it has nourished us before. Santayana echoes Humes complacency. His point is not to question animal faith but to identify its role in our cognition. In letters to fellow science fiction writer Fritz Leiber written in his final months, Lovecraft outlines an epistemology indebted to Santayana, 42 Philosophy and Literature though more tentative and pessimistic. Ability to perceive and infer, a quality at first developed solely in the interest of primitive needs & gratifications, he writes, is constantly at the mercy of the crude instincts & emotions which called it forth.11 Using this ability as we must, [we] can never know how far our kind of natural law holds good in the gulfs of space and time, or when some manifestation of it will change.12 We cannot know for sure, but we can rationally conjecture. Where Lovecraft differs from Santayana is not in doubting scientific probability but in being disappointed to fall back on animal faith. The intense desire for certainty, that burning & inextinguishable feeling of mixed wonder & oppression which the sensitive imagination experiences upon scal- ing itself & its restrictions against the vast & provocative abyss of the unknown, which Lovecraft elsewhere called the chief emotion in my psychology, fuels the anxiety of not knowing.13 This fear animates The Colour Out of Space. In Lovecrafts story, an unnamed narrator travels west of the fictional New England town of Arkham to survey the site of a prospective reservoir. Disturbed by the silent, ash-gray landscape of the blasted heath that will house the reservoir, the surveyor is led to Ammi Pierce, a local farmer who recounts the history of the strange days (COS, p. 170). Forty years ago, a meteor fell on Nahum Gardners farm. It baffled scientists with its peculiar colors and erratic properties and quickly disappeared into the earth. The next year brought unnatural abundance along with graying blight, decay, and death. The Gardners went to pieces; Ammi could do nothing; and while a part of the meteor, lodged in the Gardner farms well, shot back into space, something was left behind. What happens on the farm is, to begin with, an inductive failure. It is not just that the scientists who come from Miskatonic University to take a sample of the meteor cannot make sense of its queer properties, but that the course of nature swerves: The pears and apples slowly ripened, and Nahum vowed that his orchards were prospering as never before. The fruit was growing to phenomenal size and unwonted gloss, and in such abundance that extra barrels were ordered to handle the future crop. But with the ripening came sore disappointment; for of all that gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not one",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
color out of space,2,"single jot was fit to eat (COS, p. 177). Disappointment can be merely epistemic: the defeat of expectation. Here it is dismal, as is unwonted for unaccus- tomed, a pun on unwanted or undesired. The skunk-cabbages follow the fruit: Never were things of such size seen before. . . . Their shapes were monstrous, and the horse had snorted at an odour which struck Kieran Setiya 43 [its rider] as wholly unprecedented (p. 178). The foliage blossomed forth in strange colours and the insects . . . seemed not quite usual in their aspects and motions, and their nocturnal habits contradicted all former experience (p. 179). The strangely colored plants soon darken, and the fruit was coming out grey and dwarfed and tasteless (p. 182). Disease spreads unaccountably to the cows in a locked and undisturbed barn (p. 184). For Hume, it is by imagining the failure of induction that we reveal its ineluctable contingency. May I not clearly and distinctly conceive, Hume asks, anticipating Lovecrafts meteor, that a body, falling from the clouds, and which, in all other respects, resembles snow, has yet the taste of salt or feeling of fire? (Hume, p. 22). In The Colour Out of Space, the extent of imaginative power predicts the severity of trauma. When Nahums youngest son, Merwin, goes mad, we are told that he was getting frightfully imaginative (COS, p. 183). If Ammi is still sane, he was lucky . . . that he was not more imaginative (p. 184). And as his mind and body crumble, Nahum was past imagining: past being imagined, no longer able to imagine, passing through imagina- tion to a terrible condition of belief (p. 185). Something was creeping and creeping and waiting to be seen and felt and heard, the narrator warns, recalling his account of why the blasted heath is shunned: It is not because of anything that can be seen or heard or handled, but because of something that is imagined (pp. 185, 170). These sentences play with disruptions of pattern and rhythm, as a constant conjunction of dactyls (creeping and creeping and waiting to) yields abruptly to iambs (be seen and felt and heard), and the trochees of seen or heard or handled fragment in something imagined. Horror lies in the ever-present possibility of failed induction, a col- lapse in the expected order of things that is manifest in the swollen, toxic fruit of Nahums farm. But the shock of the unexpected plays an ambivalent role in inquiry. For Santayana, the prospect of empirical knowledge becomes evident when [the course of inner experience] is interrupted by shocks. . . . I may suffer a sort of momentary and con- scious death, in that I survive to feel the extinction of all that made up my universe, and to face a blank, or a precipice. . . . Experience of shock, if not utterly delusive, . . . establishes the validity of memory and of transitive knowledge. It establishes realism (Santayana, pp. 139, 142). Realism, here, means belief in a material world: Animal faith, being an expression of hunger, pursuit, shock, or fear, is directed upon things; that is, it assumes the existence of alien self-developing beings, 44 Philosophy and Literature independent of knowledge (p. 214). Our sense of reality itself turns on the recalcitrance of experience, its power to frustrate our expectations. Philip Fisher associates the shock of the unprecedented with the won- der in which (for Plato) philosophy begins.14 Wonder is the engine of scientific curiosity, the hospitality of the mind or soul to newness, but only where the security of the self has already been secured so deeply that security, a feeling implying the reality of fear, but its suspension, can itself be forgotten (Fisher, p. 49). The thrill of the unexpected turns on our general success in coming to explanations: the fact that curiosity is often met. As Fisher writes, The balance between fear and pleasure in the face of the unknown is an empirical fact in that it depends on a history of intellectual success and an atmosphere of almost cosmic, as opposed to social, peace (p. 50). The meteor is not at first a source of terror: Stubbornly refusing to grow cool, [the professors sample] soon had the college in a state of real excitement; and when upon heating before the spectroscope it displayed bands unlike any known colours of the normal spectrum there was much breathless talk of new elements, bizarre optical properties, and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to say when faced by the unknown (COS, pp. 17475). Even as the scientists give up, confoundedmocked as wise men and sagesAmmis attitude remains essentially scientific, as does that of the narrator, who calls for chemists and botanists to study the blasted heath",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
color out of space,3,"(pp. 17475, 192). Superimposed on the failure of our kind of natural law is the impli- cation of others.15 The meteor was nothing of this earth, but a piece of the great outside; and as such was dowered with outside properties and obedient to outside laws (p. 176).16 These laws fix the relentless progress of pollution and insanity on Nahums farm. The problem of induction is not simply the problem we inherit from Hume, that the future may not resemble the past, but the problem that, even if it does, the measures of resemblance may not be ours. In recent philosophy, the classic exposition of the latter problem is Goodmans new riddle of induction. Goodman splices green and blue to make grue, which he defines as follows: an object is grue just in case it has been observed before a certain time, say 2037, and is green; or is blue and has not been observed before that time (Goodman, pp. 7374). (By a happy coincidence of nomenclature, grue is an archaic term for the shiver of fear.) At first glance, the pattern of inductive inference seems simple: a generalization is confirmed by its instances. We infer that all emeralds are green from the fact that every Kieran Setiya 45 emerald we have observed is green. But every emerald we have observed has also been grue. Why should we not infer that the same is true of other emeralds? On this hypothesis, the emeralds we first observe after 2037 will be blue. The inference seems bad. As Goodman argues, some concepts, such as green, are apt to figure in inductive reasoning; others, such as grue, are not. Not every generalization is confirmed by its instances. Once we see this, we can ask a skeptical question. By what right do we assume that the concepts used in our inductive reasoning are like green, not grue? By what right do we assume that, in Platos metaphor, they carve the beast of nature at the joints?17 Goodman suggests that concepts figure in lawlike generalizations, confirmed by their instances, when they cor- respond to predicates entrenched in our vocabulary. He is as sanguine about this suggestionthat scientific knowledge rests on sociological factsas Hume is sanguine about his appeal to human nature. Others are more disturbed. Is it anachronistic to suggest that Lovecraft was among them? Did he worry that our ways of carving up the world might be parochial? There is reason to think he did. The idea that there are different patterns of inductive inference, different forms of animal faith that draw on different categories, can be found in Santayana: The environment determines the occasions on which intuitions arise, the psychethe inherited organiza- tion of the animaldetermines their form, and ancient conditions of life on earth no doubt determined which psyches should arise and prosper; and probably many forms of intuition, unthinkable to man, express the facts and rhythms of nature to other animal minds (Santayana, p. 88). For Santayana, it is not just the consciousness of different animals that might be inaccessibly different from ours but the rhythms of nature to which those animals respond. This idea is amplified in Lovecrafts letters: Even the world of a cat is highly different from ours, while the world of a beetle is abysmally different from either. The world of an organism on another planet especially one in another galaxyis so different from anything we can conceive that we would probably have difficulty in identifying any of its attributes beyond the simplest abstractions of time, space, & change.18 What if these alien attributes are lawlike, so that the mechanics of their nature are beyond us? Lovecraft imagines one such attribute in The Colour Out of Space. When the professors uncover a globule in the meteor, its colour, which resembled some of the bands in the meteors strange spectrum, was 46 Philosophy and Literature almost impossible to describe; and it was only by analogy that they called it colour at all (COS, pp. 17576). Apart from the resemblance to the meteor, something similar might be said of Goodmans grue. And yet the color plays a role in outside laws (p. 176). From the start, the narrator is preoccupied by the match or mismatch between language and the world, between our concepts and the joints of nature. The name blasted heath seemed to me very odd and theatrical, he complains, alluding to Macbeth. Yet arriving at the heath, he admits no other name could fit such a thing or any other thing fit such a name (COS, p. 171). The phrase blasted heath is used six times in the first three pages; so is strange days. The effect is akin to semantic satiation, as a word incessantly repeated comes to sound like meaningless noise; the familiar becomes strange.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
color out of space,4,"Strange, too, is the narrators diction: anomalous even in Lovecrafts ponderous prose. It is the language of someone wrestling an intractable world into arcane categories, for whom conventional idioms fail. The meteor was dowered with outside properties; dower is a word for dowry but also for the property granted to a widow on the death of her husband. The herb that comes out strangely colored in the spring is saxifrage, from the Latin saxum, meaning rock, and frangere, to break (COS, p. 176). No sane wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage; but everywhere those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased, underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth (p. 180). Hexis is the Greek word for habit, the ground of induction for Hume, but hectic connotes not just habitual but consumptive, the slow wasting of tissue, fever. It can be used for the flushed color of the diseased. When the light of the meteor leaves the rim of that nefandous wellnefandous having Latin roots, meaning not to be spoken ofit is surrounded by a mounting wind which seemed to sweep down in black, frore gusts from interstellar space (pp. 197, 196). Lovecrafts dictionary, the 1864 edition of Websters, cites Paradise Lost: The parching air / Burns frore and cold performs the effect of fire.19 So frore means frozen yet recalls Humes body from the clouds, resembling snow but scorching like a flame. Where Lovecrafts narrator struggles to conform his words to the cos- mic otherness of the events on Nahums farm, its inhabitants go mad. Insanity transforms their speech, intimating alien concepts, new ways to parse reality. Nahums wife is first to go: It happened in June, about the anniversary of the meteors fall, and the poor woman screamed about things in the air which she could not describe. In her ravings there Kieran Setiya 47 was not a single specific noun, but only verbs and pronouns (COS, p. 181). Nahum shuts his wife up in the attic, followed by his second son, Thaddeus. Merwin is next: The way they screamed behind their locked doors was very terrible, especially to little Merwin, who fancied they talked in some terrible language that was not of earth (p. 183). To think in terms of outside laws is to track resemblances that shape another psyche, incompatible with ours, and so to lose ones mind. Ammi is on the margins of this, at one remove. He is able to survive, though his mind was bent ever so slightly (COS, p. 185). (Another coincidence: terms like grue are called bent predicates.) The bulk of Lovecrafts narrative tells Ammis story, what he saw and felt and heard, but does so in the words of the nameless narrator, who knows it secondhand. Lovecrafts surveyor draws attention to the indirection: Often I had to recall the speaker from ramblings, piece out scientific points which he knew only by a fading parrot memory of professors talk, or bridge over gaps where his sense of logic and continuity broke down (p. 173). The weird coherence of the narration, its excess of specificity, the elaborate technical details of the scientists chemical tests: these are explicitly marked as specious, products of post hoc reconstruction. The structure of the narrative works on similar lines. Although it is meant to derive from a conversation with Ammi, we see no direct dis- course for nearly twenty pages. Even then the dialogue is not with the narrator, but between Ammi and Nahum, whose speech is quoted in implausibly precise eye dialect: Nothin . . . nothin . . . the colour . . . it burns . . . cold an wet but it burns . . . it lived in the well . . . I seen it . . . a kind o smoke . . . jest like the flowers last spring . . . it come from some place whar things aint as they is here . . . one o them professors said so . . . he was right . . . look out Ammi, itll do suthin more . . . sucks the life out (COS, pp. 18889). The language of Ammi and Nahum is not the language of the narrator; except, perhaps, in these brief stretches, the words we are reading are his, not theirs. What this narrative distancing suggests is an experience that cannot be grasped or conveyed directly, that is cloaked by mismatched terms. It is as if we were reading a translation from one verbal or conceptual scheme to another. The narrators impossible attempt to occupy Ammis perspective, shaped now by a color that is not a color, yet was to him of no unfa- miliar hue (COS, p. 191), accounts for",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes
color out of space,5,"the weird, strained use of free indirect style in the storys linguistic crescendo. Lovecraft is often mocked, sometimes appropriately, for his baroque adjectivitis, but the narrators prose is relatively spare and matter-of-fact until the end.20 Then, 48 Philosophy and Literature as investigators look from Nahums window at the waving branches of a tree, they see a thousand tiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance. . . . It was a monstrous constellation of unnatural light, like a glutted swarm of corpse-fed fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an accursed marsh (pp. 19394). The color that pours from its buried home is a riot of luminous amorphousness, that alien and undimensioned rainbow of cryptic poison from the wellseething, feeling, lapping, reaching, scintillating, straining, and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and unrecog- nizable chromaticism (p. 196). The narrators crazed diction intimates a crazed experience, described from the inside. It makes no sense for the narrator himself to use these words, to be so moved by an encounter he did not have. It is as if his idiom has been polluted by Ammis, by an experience so intense it has to be expressed from the perspective of its subject. And yet the narrators language in these spells of free indirect style is palpably unlike anything Ammi could have uttered. The alien perspective is at once infectious and incommunicable, like the color. What exactly happens to the narrators words? At pivotal moments, they become like Mrs. Gardners: not a single specific noun, but only verbs and pronouns. That is what transpires when the light departs, seething, feeling, lapping, reaching, scintillating, straining, and malignly bubbling, a pattern of unmodified verbs disrupted by a single adverb. And it is what happens, more discreetly, when Nahum dies: That which spoke could speak no more because it had completely caved in (COS, p. 189). Verbs behave oddly from the beginning of the story, which personifies buildings, landscapes, vegetation. We see squat, moss-coated cottages brooding eternally over old New England secrets [where] the blasted heath will slumber (COS, p. 170). Weeds and briers reigned over the hillsides (p. 171). On Nahums farm, the black well yawned deep near the site of the great rock that fell down out of the sky and bed- ded itself in the ground (p. 173). Among the earliest signs of inductive failure are peculiar forms of agency, as abnormality shifts from verbs to actions: the leaps of the rabbit were longer than either Ammi or his horse liked and a dead woodchucks body seemed slightly altered in a queer way impossible to describe, while its face had taken on an expression which no one ever saw in a woodchuck before (p. 178). Soon nature is not just personified but animate. Nahums second son Thaddeus, a lad of fifteen, swore that [the trees] swayed also when there was no wind (COS, p. 179); a detached piece of phosphorescence appeared to stir furtively in the yard (p. 181); and we find great bare Kieran Setiya 49 trees clawing up at the grey November sky with a studied malevolence (p. 186). The animation of nature peaks as the investigators see the lights around the farm, in another blaze of free indirect style: And yet amid that tense, godless calm the high bare boughs of all the trees in the yard were moving. They were twitching morbidly and spasmodically, clawing in convulsive and epileptic madness at the moonlit clouds; scratching impotently in the noxious air as if jerked by some alien and bloodless line of linkage with subterrene horrors writhing and struggling below the black roots (p. 193). The idea of agency in the inanimate world may seem quite distant from the problem of induction. But Santayana explicitly connects the two. Dissecting the structures of animal faith that underlie our attribu- tion of mental states, Santayana sees no principled gap between the the analogy of nature [that] would suggest that the other living creatures in the world are animate, too, and discourse privately no less assiduously and absurdly than I do and an animism on which all the substance of nature is ready to think: The character of this universal animation, or readiness to think, is inconceivable by me, in so far as its organs or objects differ from my own. The forms of it are doubtless as various as the forms of material being; a stone will think like me, in so far as it lives like me (Santayana, p. 250). In a 1916 letter to the Kleicomolo (a correspondence group including Lovecraft, Rheinhart Kleiner, Maurice Moe, and Ira Cole), Lovecraft anticipates Santayana, perhaps with tongue in cheek: How do we know that that form of atomic and molecular motion called life is the highest of all forms? Perhaps the dominant creaturethe most rational and God-like of all",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
color out of space,6,"beingsis an invisible gas! Or perhaps it is a flaming and effulgent mass of molten star-dust. Who can say that men have souls while rocks have none?21 Whatever he believed, Lovecrafts imagination was gripped by the idea of beings whose form of agency, life, and thought is wholly differ- ent from ours, and by the possibility that that such beings exist around us. That we cannot conclusively rule them out is one lesson of Humes problem; that they might obey or acknowledge laws of nature utterly alien to us is a lesson of Goodmans. Santayana and Lovecraft unite these problems, synthesizing or conflating the prospect of alien mental and physical phenomena. They share a materialism that is close to Russells neutral monism: rejecting a duality of mind and matter but agnostic about the nature of the one form of substance and attribute there is.22 Ultimate reality is neither mental nor physical, or it is both; either way, its intrinsic nature is beyond us. Induction can fail; even where it works, 50 Philosophy and Literature it may depend on alien concepts; and even then, it illuminates only patterns of relation, not the nature of reality in itself. In The Colour Out of Space, movement becomes a metonym for this nexus of ideas. Moving can mean causing motion, changing place or posture, or it can mean touching, pathetic.23 It can blur or fuse the mental and the physical. When the Gardners stare into the well, they are terrified by the moving colours down there (COS, p. 183). And when Ammi walks into the attic room in which Nahums wife is disintegrating, [strange] colours danced before his eyes (p. 187). But the terrible thing about this horror was that it very slowly perceptibly moved as it continued to crumble. . . . [The] shape in the corner does not reappear in his tale as a moving object. There are things which cannot be mentioned, and what is done in common humanity is sometimes cruelly judged by the law. I gather that no moving thing was left in that attic room (p. 187). Is it contrived to hear moving as a pun, the moving object as both animate and pitiful, and the same with moving colours? Lovecraft drops a hint. Near the end of the story, hardened investigators come to Nahums farm and search the house: Used as the officers were to gruesome experiences, not one remained unmoved at what was found in the attic (p. 190). A moving thing was left there, after all. Perhaps not coincidentally, that same pun is used by Santayana in his account of animal faith. Discussing animals early in his book, he writes: The notion of a moving world is brought implicitly with them; they fetch it out of the depths of their vegetating psyche, which is a small dark cosmos, silently revolving within (Santayana, pp. 3839). Theirs is a world of physical objects in motion, but also of hunger and fear. It may not be a coincidence, either, that Lovecrafts edition of Websters dictionary lists under moving: Moving plant (Bot.), a plant of the genus Hedysarum (H. Gyrans);so called because its leaflets have an automatic motion (Webster, p. 864). Might this be the root of Lovecrafts twitch- ing, clawing trees? Vegetation is a locus of horror in The Colour Out of Space, from the trees to the glossy, bloated, and then shriveled, graying fruit. Fruit is itself another pun, appearing at the bookends of Ammis story. When the meteor is struck by lightning and disappears, Nahum tries to find some remnant, but [digging] had borne no fruit (COS, p. 176). Striving to capture what he has learned from Ammi, the narrator concludes: This was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories (p. 199): fruit as product Kieran Setiya 51 and as the pulpy vessel of seeds. For Santayana, fruit furnishes an image of the animal psyche. Spirit is a fruition, he writes, and there are naturally as many qualities of fruition as there are fruits to ripen (Santayana, p. 275). What, then, is the fruit of Lovecraft on induction? His questions are not epistemic but affective. On the epistemology of induction, Lovecraft sides with Santayana and Hume. We cannot have certain knowledge of natural law, but we do not need it to justify our estimates of probability. It is epistemically rational to depend on animal faith. What this leaves open is how to feel about this dependence, how it should affect or move us. Lovecraft is known for his conviction of cosmic insignificance, canonically expressed in a letter to Weird Tales editor Farnsworth Wright: Now all my tales are based on the fundamental premise that common human laws and interests and emotions have no validity or",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
color out of space,7,"significance in the vast cosmos-at-large. . . . To achieve the essence of real external- ity, whether of time or space or dimension, one must forget that such things as organic life, good and evil, love and hate, and all such local attributes of a negligible and temporary race called mankind, have any existence at all.24 It is hard to see how the vastness or indifference of the cosmos, or the absence of cosmic teleology, could have the implications Lovecraft seems to draw. Why should these things mean that good and evil, love and hate are insignificant? Or that, as Lovecraft writes in another let- ter, Nothing really matters?25 For Lovecraft, a mere knowledge of the approximate dimensions of the visible universe is enough to destroy forever the notion of a personal godhead whose whole care is expended upon puny mankind.26 But the basis of the inference is obscure; and the inference to nihilism is no better.27 The impression of insignificance in the vast, indifferent cosmos is not peculiar to Lovecraft. Is that impression simply confused? I dont believe it is. The mistake is to interpret this response as an inference from a metaphysical premise, a claim about the nature of the universe, to a conclusion about what matters. The question how to feel about a philosophical idea is less about its ethical implications than about the emotions it makes fitting or discordant. Matters of this kind are the proper subject of disputes about the meaning of life. How are we to feel about the large-scale properties of existence, the size of the universe, the pervasiveness of suffering, and the extent of what we do not know? Not everyone reacts in the same way to the immensity of the cosmos. In a talk to the Cambridge Apostles in 1925, Frank Ramsey memorably 52 Philosophy and Literature joked: Where I seem to differ from some of my friends is in attaching little importance to physical size. I dont feel the least humble before the vastness of the heavens. The stars may be large but they cannot think or love; and these are qualities that impress me far more than size does. I take no credit for weighing nearly seventeen stone.28 I used to feel like Lovecraft: awed and diminished by the panorama of the dark night sky, the endless stars. Now, when I think about the universe with its virtually certain sprinkling of unknown life-forms, I am relieved that the fate of intelligent life most likely does not rest in our unsteady hands.29 It would be rash to argue that Lovecrafts sentiment alone is apt. But when we turn to our inductive frailty, I think that Lovecraft has a point. How should we feel about the contingency of inductive success? How to be moved by the fact that nature might swerve, the prospect that our concepts do not carve it at the joints, that its inner character is hidden, unsusceptible to discovery by any means? I suppose we could respond like Santayana, by turns phlegmatic or inspired: Nothing that happens is groundless, since whatever antecedents it actually has are adequate to produce it. Yet all that happens is marvellous, because like existence itself it is unfathomable (Santayana, p. 211). I can barely conceive the security of the self (in Fishers words) that lies behind such equanimity. For the most part, I dont ask how life depends on the consonance of our cognition with causal powers that persist and project into the future. But when I do, I worry. The Colour Out of Space elicits an inductive vertigo that is the flip side of curiosity, the desire for an impossible assurance, for a cosmic, not merely social, peace.

"The Picture of Dorian Gray - Oscar Wilde -- Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde -- ( WeLib.org )",0,"The Picture of Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde retold by Jill Nevile OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS 1989 THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY Stage 3 Can a painting of a person tell you more about him than the person's own face? If it is painted with love, perhaps the painting will show more than just the outside of that person perhaps ir will show the inside. We often say that a face is like an open book: 'the face tells its own story,' we say. When Dorian Gray sees the painting of his own face, he falls in love with his own beauty. Nothing must touch his beauty, nothing must hurt or change it not love, not even time. And so he cuts the link between his face and his heart, between his outside and his inside. His face does not change; it stays young and beautiful. But the picture - painted with love - tells the true story. It shows the real Dorian Gray, who is growing old and ugly and full of hate. Oscar Wilde {1854-1900} was one of Ireland's best and cleverest writers. His plays and children's stories, as well as The Picture of Dorian Gray, are still enjoyed today, although they were written almost 100 years ago. OXFORD BOOKWORMS Series Editor: Tricia Hedge The Artist 'I have put too much of myself into this painting.' 1 Through the open windows of the room came the rich scent of summer flowers. Lord Henry Wotton lay back in his chair and smoked his cigarette. Beyond the soft sounds of the garden he could just hear the noise of London. In the centre of the room there was a portrait of a very beautiful young man, and in front of it stood the artist himself, Basil Hallward. 'It's your best work, Basil, the best portrait that you've ever painted,' said Lord Henry lazily. 'You must send it to the best art gallery in London.' 'No,' Basil said slowly. 'No, I won't send it anywhere.' Lord Henry was surprised. 'But my dear Basil, why not?' he asked. 'What strange people you artists are! You want to be famous, but then you're not happy when you are famous. It's bad when people talk about you - but it's much worse when they don't talk about you.' 'I know you'll laugh at me,' replied Basil, 'but I can't exhibit the picture in an art gallery. I've put too much of myself into it.' Lord Henry laughed. 'Too much of yourself into it! You don't look like him at all. He has a fair and beautiful face. And you - well, you look intelligent, of course, but with The Picture of Dorian Gray The Artist your strong face and black hair, you are not beautiful.' 'You don't understand me, Harry,' replied Basil. (Lord Henry's friends always called him Harry.) 'Of course I'm not like him,' Basil continued. 'In fact, I prefer not to be beautiful. Dorian Gray's beautiful face will perhaps bring him danger and trouble.' 'Dorian Gray? Is that his name?' asked Lord Henry. 'Yes. But I didn't want to tell you.' 'Why not?' 'Oh, I can't explain,' said Basil. 'When I like people a lot, I never tell their names to my other friends. I love secrets, that's all.' 'Of course,' agreed his friend. 'Life is much more exciting when you have secrets. For example, I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I'm doing. When we meet - and we do meet sometimes - we tell each other crazy stories, and we pretend that they're true.' 'You pretend all the time, Harry,' said Basil. 'I think that you're probably a very good husband, but you like to hide your true feelings.' 'Oh, don't be so serious, Basil,' smiled Lord Henry. 'Let's go into the garden.' 'It's the best portrait that you've ever painted, said Lord Henry. I n the garden the leaves shone in the sunlight, and the flowers moved gently in the summer wind. The two young men sat on a long seat under the shadow of a tall tree. The Picture of Dorian Gray The Artist 'Before I go,' said Lord Henry, 'you must answer my question, Basil. Why won't you exhibit Dorian Gray's portrait in an art gallery?' He looked at his friend and smiled. 'Please give me the real reason, now. Not the answer that you gave me before.' 'Harry, when an artist feels strongly about a portrait, it becomes a portrait of himself, not of the sitter. The artist paints the face and body of the sitter, but in fact he shows his own feelings. The reason why I won't exhibit this portrait is because I'm afraid it shows the secret of my heart.' Lord Henry laughed. 'And what is this secret of",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
"The Picture of Dorian Gray - Oscar Wilde -- Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde -- ( WeLib.org )",1,"your heart?' His friend was silent. Lord Henry picked a flower and looked at it with interest. 'Two months ago,' Basil said at last, 'I was at a party at Lady Brandon's house. I was talking to friends when I realized that someone was watching me. I turned and saw Dorian Gray for the first rime. We looked at each other, and I felt a sudden, very strong fear. I felt that this person could change my life . . . could bring me happiness - and unhappiness. Later, Lady Brandon introduced us. We laughed at something that she said, and became friends at once.' He stopped. Lord Henry smiled. 'Tell me more,' he said. 'How often do you see him?' 'Every day,' answered Basil. 'I'm not happy if I don't see him every day he's necessary to my life;' 'But I thought you only cared about your art,' said Lord Henry. 'He is all my art now,' replied Basil, seriously. 'Since I met Dorian Gray, the work that I've done is good, the best work 'I'm afraid that the picture shows the secret of . my heart,' said Basil. The Picture of Dorian Gray The Artist 'Mr Dorian Gray has arrived, sir,' he said to Basil. 'You have to introduce me now,' laughed Lord Henry. Basil turned to him. 'Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,' he said quietly. 'He's a good person and he's young - only twenty. Don't change him. Don't try to influence him. Your clever words are very amusing, of course, but you laugh at serious things. Don't take him away from me. He's necessary to my life as an artist.' Lord Henry smiled. 'You worry too much, my friend,' he said, and together they walked back into the house. of my life. Because of him I see art in a different way, a new way. When I'm with him, I paint wonderful pictures.' 'Basil, this is extraordinary. I must meet Dorian Gray,' said Lord Henry. Basil got up and walked up and down the garden. 'So that's my secret. Dorian doesn't know about my feelings. And I can't let people see the portrait, because it shows what's in my heart. There's too much of myself in it, Harry, too much!' Lord Henry looked at Basil's face before he spoke. 'Tell me, does Dorian Gray care about you?' The artist thought for a few moments. 'He likes me,' he said at last. 'I know he likes me. Usually he's very friendly to me, but sometimes he seems to enjoy hurting me. He says unkind things that give me pain, Harry. And then I feel that I've given myself to somebody who thinks my heart is a pretty flower. A flower that he can enjoy for a summer's day, and can forget tomorrow.' 'Summer days, Basil,' said Lord Henry with a smile, 'can sometimes be too long. Perhaps you'll become tired sooner than he will.' 'Harry, don't talk like that. While I live, Dorian Gray will be important to me. You change your feelings too quickly. You can't feel what I feel.' 'My dear Basil, how unkind you are!' Lord Henry was amused. How interesting other people's lives were, he thought. Slowly he pulled a flower to pieces with his long fingers. 'I remember now,' he continued, 'I think my aunt knows Dorian Gray. I'd like to meet him very much.' 'But I don't want you to meet him,' said Basil. A servant came across the garden towards them. The Friend 'There is nothing in the world as important as youth!' 3 A s they entered the house, they saw Dorian Gray. He was sitting by the window and turning some pages of music. 'You must lend me this music, Basil,' he said. Then he turned and saw Lord Henry. 'Oh, I'm sorry, Basil. I didn't realize . . .' 'Dorian, this is Lord Henry Wotton,' said Basil. 'He's an old friend of mine:' Dorian Gray shook hands with Lord Henry, and while they talked, Lord Henry studied the young man. Yes, he was very good-looking indeed, with his bright blue eyes and his gold hair. He had an open, honest face. There were no dark secrets in that face. Lord Henry could understand Basil's feelings for him. Basil was getting his paints ready. Now he looked at Lord Henry. 'Harry,' he said, 'I want to finish this portrait of Dorian today. I'm afraid I must ask you to go away.' Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. 'Should I go, Mr Gray?' he asked. 'Oh, please don't leave, Lord Henry. Basil never talks when he's painting, and it's so boring. Please stay. I'd like you to talk to me.' 'Well, Basil?'Lord Henry asked. The Friend The artist bit his lip. 'Very well, Harry. Stay .",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes
"The Picture of Dorian Gray - Oscar Wilde -- Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde -- ( WeLib.org )",2,".. if you must.' ""While Basil painted, Lord Henry talked, and the young man listened. The words filled Dorian's head like music wild, exciting music. What a beautiful voice Lord Henry has, he thought. They are only words, but how terrible they are! How bright and dangerous! You cannot escape from words. Dorian began to understand things about himself that he had never understood before. Why had he never seen himself so clearly, he wondered? Lord Henry watched Dorian, and smiled. He knew when to speak, and when to be silent. He felt very interested in this young man, with his wonderful face. Later they walked in the garden together, while Basil worked at the portrait. The rich scent of the flowers was all around them. Dorian looked at the older man, and wondered about him. He was tall, with a thin dark face and cool white hands. Dorian liked him, but why did he feel a little afraid of him? 'You must come out of the sun, Mr Gray,' said Lord Henry. 'A brown skin isn't fashionable and it won't suit you.' 'Oh, it doesn't matter,' laughed Dorian. 'But it should matter to you, Mr. Gray.' ' 'Why?' asked Dorian. 'Because you're young, and being young is wonderful. Ah, you smile. You don't think so now, but one day you'll understand what I mean when you're old, and tired, and no longer beautiful. You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr Gray. It's true. Don't shake your head at. me. And there's nothing more important, more valuable than beauty. When The Picture of Dorian Gray The Friend your youth goes, your beauty will go with it. Then you'll suddenly discover that your life is empty - there will be nothing to enjoy, nothing to hope for. Time is your enemy, Mr Gray. It will steal everything from you. People are afraid of themselves today. Afraid to live. But you, with your face and your youth, there's nothing that you cannot do. You must live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! We can never be young again. Youth! Ah, there is nothing in the world as important as youth!' Dorian Gray listened and wondered. New ideas filled his head. He felt strange, different. At that moment Basil called them from the house. Lord Henry turned to Dorian. 'You're happy that you've met me, Mr Gray,' he said. 'Yes, I'm happy now. Will I always be happy, I wonder?' 'Always!' Lord Henry smiled. 'What a terrible word! Women use it much too often. What does it mean? It's today that is important.' I n the house Basil Hallward stood in front of the portrait of Dorian Gray. 'It's finished,' he said. He wrote his name in the corner of the picture. Lord Henry studied the picture carefully. 'Yes,' he said. 'It's your best work. It's excellent. Mr Gray, come and look 'When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it,' said Lord Henry. at yourself.' Dorian looked at the picture for a long time. He smiled as he saw the beautiful face in front of him, and for a moment The Picture of Dorian Gray The Friend he felt happy. But then he remembered Lord Henry's words. 'How long', he thought, 'will I look like the picture? Time will steal my beauty from me. I will grow old, but the picture will always be young.' And his heart grew cold with fear. 'Don't you like it, Dorian?' asked Basil at last. 'Of course he likes it,' said Lord Henry. 'It's a very fine work of art. I'd like to buy it myself.' 'It's not mine to sell, Harry. The picture is Dorian's.' 'I wish,' cried Dorian suddenly, 'I wish that I could always stay young and that the picture could grow old.' Lord Henry laughed. 'I don't think you would like that, Basil, would you?' 'No, I wouldn't like it at all,' agreed Basil with a smile. ' Dorian turned, his face red and angry. 'Yes, you like your art better than your friends,' he said to Basil. 'How long will you like me? Only while I'm beautiful, I suppose. Lord Henry is right. Youth is the most important thing in the world. Oh, why did you paint this picture? Why should it stay young while I grow old? I wish the picture could change, and I could stay as I am. I would give anything, yes, anything, for that.' He hid his face in his hands. 'Dorian, Dorian!' said Basil unhappily. 'Don't talk like that. You're my dearest friend.' He turned to Lord Henry. 'What have you been teaching him?' he asked angrily. 'Why didn't you go away when I asked you?' Lord Henry smiled. 'It's the real Dorian Gray - that's all.' Basil turned and walked quickly",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes
"The Picture of Dorian Gray - Oscar Wilde -- Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde -- ( WeLib.org )",3,"over to the portrait. 'It's my best work, but now I hate it. I will destroy it now, before it destroys our friendship.' He picked up a long knife. 'I wish that I could always stay young and that the picture could grow old,' cried Dorian. The picture of Dorian Gray The Friend But Dorian was there before him. 'No, Basil, don't! You can't destroy it. That would be murder!' 'So,' said Basil coldly, 'you've decided that you like the portrait after all."""" 'Like it?' said Dorian. 'I'm in love with it. I cannot live without it.' Later, during tea, Lord Henry invited Basil and Dorian to go with him to the theatre that night. Basil refused, but Dorian was happy to accept. 'Stay and have dinner with me, Dorian,"" said Basil, but no, Dorian preferred to go to the theatre with Lord Henry. As the door closed behind Dorian and Lord Henry, Basil turned back to the picture. 'I shall stay here with the real Dorian Gray,' he said sadly to himself. T he next morning Lord Henry went to visit his aunt, 'I thought you fashionable young men never got Lady Agatha. She was surprised to see him. up until the afternoon,' she said. 'Ah, but my dear aunt, I need some information, you see,' replied Lord Henry. 'I met Dorian Gray yesterday, and I'd like to know more about him.' 'Oh, he's Lord Kelso's grandson,' said Lady Agatha. 'His mother was Lady Margaret Devereux, a very beautiful woman. She ran away from home to marry a poor soldier. He was killed a few months later and she died soon after her son was born. She was a lovely woman. Dorian Gray has her beauty and he will, I understand, have his grandfather's money.' 'He is', agreed Lord Henry, 'extraordinarily good-looking.' 'Come to lunch,' invited his aunt. 'Dorian Gray will be here and you can meet him again.' 'I'd love to come,' smiled Lord Henry. As he left, Lord Henry thought about this sad story. He became more interested than ever in this beautiful young man, Dorian Gray. He remembered the night before, when Dorian had watched him with his bright blue eyes, half wondering, half afraid. 'He does not yet know himself, thought Lord Henry, with a smile. 'But I can teach him. Yes, I can influence him in any way that I please. I will teach him to discover the fire of youth, and love, and life.' The conversation among the fashionable people at Lady Agatha's lunch was quick and clever. Lord Henry talked, in his lazy, amusing way. and knew that Dorian Gray was watching and listening. After a while the conversation turned to a friend's plans to marry an American girl. 'Why can't these American women stay in their own country? They're always telling us that it's a paradise for women,' said Lord Burdon. 'It is,' said Lord Henry. 'That's the reason why they're so happy to escape from it.' 'They say,' laughed the man next to Lady Agatha, 'that when good Americans die, they go to Paris.' 'Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?' asked Lady Agatha. The Picture of Dorian Gray The Friend 'They go to America,' said Lord Henry. People smiled, and the conversation moved on to other things. Lord Henry took ideas and played with them; he gave them wings, and they flew like brightly coloured birds around the room. People laughed, and smiled, and told him that he should be more serious. But Dorian Gray never took his eyes away from Lord Henry. After lunch Lord Henry said that he was going to the park and as he left the room, Dorian Gray touched his arm. 'May I come with you?' he asked. 'But I thought you'd promised to go and see Basil Hallward,' Lord Henry replied. 'Yes, but I'd prefer to come with you. Please let me,' said Dorian. 'I want to listen to you talking. Nobody speaks as well as you do.' 'Ah! I've talked enough for today.' Lord Henry smiled. 'But you may come with me if you want to.' Dorian Gray never took his eyes away from Lord Henry. The Young Man in Love 'Love is a more wonderful thing than art.' 6 One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray visited Lord Henry. Dorian was excited and his eyes were shining. 'Harry,' he began, 'I'm discovering life. I'm doing everything that you told me to do. I'm in love!' 'Who are you in love with?' asked Lord Henry, calmly. 'With an actress.' 'Oh, everybody's in love with an actress at some time in their lives,' said Lord Henry. 'No, Harry, this is different. She's wonderful! Her name's Sybil Vane, and one day she'll be a very famous actress. She really is",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
"The Picture of Dorian Gray - Oscar Wilde -- Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde -- ( WeLib.org )",4,"extraordinarily clever.' 'My dear boy,' said Lord Henry in his lazy voice, 'no woman is extraordinarily clever. Women have nothing to say, but they say it beautifully. There are only five women in London who can give you real conversation. But tell me about your wonderful actress. How long have you known her?' 'Harry! I'll tell you all about her, but you must promise not to laugh.' Lord Henry listened and smiled. Dorian had discovered an old, dirty theatre in a poor street in London. He had gone in to look for adventure, but had found love, he told Lord The Young Man in Love 'I went in to look for adventure, but I found love,' Dorian told Lord Henry. The Picture of Dorian Gray Henry. The play had been Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. 'Romeo was a fat old man with a terrible voice, but Juliet! Oh, Harry, she was about seventeen, with dark brown hair and a face like a flower. She was the loveliest girl that I'd ever seen in my life, and her voice' was like music. I love her, Harry. She's everything to me. Every night I go to see her in different plays and,she's always wonderful.' That's the reason, I suppose, why you never have dinner with me now,' said Lord Henry. 'But Harry, you and I see each other every day - we always have lunch together,' said Dorian in surprise. 'I have to go and see Sybil in the theatre every night. You and Basil must come with me to see her. Then you can see yourself how wonderful she is. Come tomorrow.' 'Very well, my dear Dorian, we'll come and watch your Juliet. But you'll be in love many times, you know - this is only the beginning.' After Dorian had gone, Lord Henry' smiled to himself. How amusing it was to watch this young man, he thought. He was very different now from the frightened boy in Basil Hallward's house. He had opened like a flower in the sun, and was learning to enjoy every pleasure in life. 'And it is I,' thought Lord Henry, 'who have taught him how to do this.' When Lord Henry returned home that night, there was a letter for him lying on the table. It told him that Dorian Gray was going to marry Sybil Vane. The Young Man in Love 7 Mother, Mother, I'm so happy,' cried the girl, 'and you must be happy too.' Mrs Vane put her thin white hands on her daughter's head. 'I'm only happy when I see you in the theatre,' she said. 'And we are poor. We need the money don't forget that. What do we know about this young man? You don't know his real name, or anything about him.' 'No, but I call him Prince Charming. He's everything to me. I love him and he loves me. Oh Mother, let me be happy!' 'You're too young to think of love,' said her mother. She looked at her daughter's lovely face, and tried to warn her of the dangers of love, but the girl did not listen. She was locked in her prison of love. At that moment the girl's brother entered the room. He was a heavy, dark young man, not at all like his sister. 'I've heard about a gentleman who visits you every night at the theatre,' he said to his sister. 'Who is he? What does he want?' 'Oh James, don't be angry with me today,' cried Sybil. 'You're leaving for Australia tomorrow, and today is your last day. Come for a walk with me in the park. I'll go and get ready.' She danced out of the room, and her mother and brother could hear her singing as she ran upstairs. James Vane turned to his mother. 'My new life as a sailor will keep me away from England for many years,' he said, 'But I don't like to leave Sybil alone.' 'Sybil has me, her mother, you know,' said Mrs Vane quietly. The Picture of Dorian Gray 'Oh James, don't be angry with me today,' cried Sybil Vane. The Young Man in Love Then take care of her.' James Vane gave his mother a long, hard look. 'If that man hurts my sister, I'll find him, and kill him like a dog.' As they waited for Dorian Gray the next night, Lord Henry and Basil Hallward discussed Sybil Vane. Basil had not been happy at the news of Dorian's .marriage plans. ""An actress!' he had cried. 'But Dorian is a gentleman, the grandson of Lord Kelso. He can't marry an actress.' 'Why not?' Lord Henry had said coolly. 'He'll love her wildly for six months, and then suddenly he'll be in love with another woman. It will be very amusing to",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

But when Dorian arrived and told the story of his love, Basil became a little happier..'You're right,' he told Dorian. 'The woman that you love must be wonderful. I can see already that she's changed you.' , 'Yes,' said Dorian happily, 'yes, Sybil has changed me. From this moment I shall be good. I'll never listen again, Harry, to your dangerous ideas about life and pleasure.' Lord Henry smiled. 'Ah,' he said, 'when we are happy, we are always good, but when we are good, we are not always happy.' Basil Hallward shook his head at this, but Dorian laughed. 'You cut life to pieces with your clever words, Harry.' The theatre was crowded and noisy, but when Sybil Vane The Picture of Dorian Gray The Young Man in Love appeared, everyone became silent. She was one of the most beautiful girls that Lord Henry had ever seen. 'Lovely! Lovely!' he said softly. But although Sybil looked beautiful, her voice sounded unnatural, She spoke Juliet's words, but there was no feeling in them. Her voice was lovely, but it took away all the life from the words. People in the theatre began talking loudly, and after half an hour Lord Henry stood up and put on his coat. 'She's very beautiful, Dorian, but she's not an actress,' he said. 'Let's go.' 'I think that Miss Vane must be ill,' added Basil. 'We'll come another night.' Dorian, did not look at them. 'Go away. I want to be alone,' he said miserably, and as his friends left, he covered his face with his hands. When the play came to its painful end, Dorian went to see Sybil. 'I wasn't a very good Juliet tonight,' she said, and looked at him with love in her eyes. 'You were terrible,' said Dorian coldly. 'My friends were bored. I was bored. I suppose you were ill.' She did not seem to hear him. 'Dorian,' she cried, 'before I knew you, the theatre was my only life. I thought that it was all true. I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought that they were real. But you've taught me the difference between art and life. How can I pretend to be Juliet - to feel Juliet's love, when I know now what true love is?' Dorian turned his face away from her. 'But I loved you for your art because you were a wonderful actress,' he said. His voice was hard. 'You have killed my love. Without your art, you are nothing. I never want to see you again.' Sybil's face was white with fear. 'You're not serious, are you, Dorian?' she asked. She touched his arm with her small, gentle hand. 'Don't touch me!' he shouted angrily. He pushed her away, and she fell to the floor and lay there like a broken bird. 'Dorian, please don't leave me,' she cried. 'I love you better than anything in the world. Don't leave me!' 'I love you better than anything in the world. Don't leave me, Dorian!' The Picture of Dorian Gray Dorian Gray looked down at her with his beautiful eyes. There was no love or gentleness in his face. 'I'm going,' he said at last. 'I don't wish to be unkind, but I don't want to see you again.' Without another word he left her. All night he walked through the streets of London. When morning came, he went home. When he entered his house, he saw the portrait of himself that Basil Hallward had painted. There was something different about it, he thought. The face had changed - there was something unkind, and cruel about the mouth. It was very strange. He picked up a mirror and looked at his own face, and then looked again at the face in the portrait. Yes, it was different. What did this change mean? Suddenly he remembered his wish in Basil Hallward's house . . . his wish that he could stay young, but the picture could grow old. The idea was impossible, of course. But why did the face in the picture have that cruel, unkind mouth? Cruel! Had he been cruel to Sybil Vane? He remembered her white, unhappy face as she lay at his feet. But she had hurt him, too. No, Sybil Vane was nothing to him now. But the picture watched him, with its beautiful face and its cruel smile. It had taught him to love his own beauty. Would it also teach him to hate his own heart, his own soul? No, he would go back to Sybil Vane. He would marry her, try to love her again. Poor child! How cruel he had been to her! They would be happy together. He covered the picture and quickly left the room. The Death of Love 'It is",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes

His servant brought him tea and his letters, but he did not read them. Yesterday seemed like a bad dream, but when he went downstairs, he saw the covered picture. Should he uncover it, he wondered? Had the face in the picture really changed? Did he want to know? He lit a cigarette and thought for a while. Yes, he had to know. He lifted the cover. There was no mistake. The portrait had really changed. He could not explain it, could not understand it. It was impossible, but it had happened. Dorian felt sick and ashamed. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he sat down and wrote a long letter to Sybil Vane. He covered page after page with wild words of love. Then, suddenly, he heard Lord Henry's voice at the door. Dorian jumped up and covered the picture. 'My dear boy,' said Lord Henry, as he came in. 'I'm so sorry. But you must not think too much about her.' 'Do you mean about Sybil Vane?' asked Dorian. There's nothing to be sorry about. I want to be good, and I'm going to be happy. I shall marry Sybil Vane. I'm not going to break my promise to her.'! 'Marry Sybil Vane!' Lord Henry stared at Dorian. 'Didn't you get my letter?' The Picture of Dorian Gray The Death of Love 'I haven't read my letters today,' said Dorian slowly. Lord Henry walked across the room and took Dorian's 'Dorian,' he said quietly, 'don't be hands in his own. frightened - my letter told you that Sybil Vane is dead. She killed herself at the theatre last night.' 'No, no, that's impossible!' cried Dorian. He pulled his hands away and stared at Lord Henry with wild eyes. 'This is terrible, Harry. I have murdered Sybil Vane!' 'She killed herself,' said Lord Henry calmly, 'You didn't murder her. She killed herself because she loved you. It's very sad, of course, but you mustn't think too much about it. You must come and have dinner with me.' 'Harry, listen. Last night I told her that I didn't want to see her again. But after I left her, I realized how cruel I had been. I decided to go back to her, to marry her. And now she is dead! Harry, what shall I do? You don't know the danger that I am in.' 'My dear Dorian,' said Lord Henry. 'Marriage with Sybil Vane was not for you. No, no . . . marriages like that are never successful. The man quickly becomes unhappy and | bored. Of course, he's kind to his wife. We can always be kind to people that we're not interested in. But the woman soon discovers that her husband is bored. And then she either becomes terribly unfashionable, or wears very expensive hats that another woman's husband has to pay for.' The young man walked up and down the room. 'I suppose that's true,' he said unhappily. 'But Harry, I don't think that I'm cruel. Do you?' Lord Henry smiled. He told Dorian Gray what he wanted to hear. And then he told him clever, amusing stories about The portrait had really changed. There was something unkind, cruel about the mouth. It was very strange. The Picture of Dorian Gray The Death of Love the women that he himself had loved. He said that Sybil Vane's death was a beautiful end to a love story for an actress. 'The girl never really lived,' he continued, 'so she never really died. Don't cry for Sybil Vane. She was less real than Juliet.' After a while Dorian Gray looked up. 'You have explained me to myself, Harry,' he said slowly. 'How well you know me! But we won't talk of this again. It's been a wonderful lesson for me. That's all.' When Lord Henry had left, Dorian uncovered the picture again. He had to choose between a good life and a bad life, he thought. But then he realized that, in fact, he had already chosen. He would stay young for ever, and enjoy every wild pleasure that life could give him. The face in the picture would grow old and ugly and unkind, but he would stay beautiful for ever. He covered the picture again, and smiled. An hour later he was at Lord Henry's house, and Lord Henry was smiling at his side. 10 While Dorian was having, breakfast the next morning, Basil Hallward came to see him. 'At last .I've found you, Dorian,' he said seriously. 'I came last night, but they told me that you'd gone out to dinner with friends. I knew that wasn't true, of course.

He looked bored. 'I was at Lord Henry's house last night. It was a very amusing evening.' Basil stared at him. 'You went out to dinner?' he said slowly. 'You went out to dinner when Sybil Vane was lying dead in some dirty theatre?' 'Stop, Basil! I won't listen to you!' Dorian jumped to his feet. 'Sybil Vane is in the past . . . finished . . . forgotten.' 'You went out to dinner when Sybil Vane was lying dead in some dirty theatre?' asked Basil. The Picture of Dorian Gray The Death of Love 'You've changed, Dorian,' said Basil. 'You have the same wonderful face, but where is the kind and gentle boy who sat for my portrait? Have you no heart?' 'Yesterday my heart was full of sadness. I have cried for Sybil, yes, but I cannot cry today. I have changed, Basil. I'm a man now, with new feelings, new ideas. Don't be angry with me. I am what I am. There's nothing more to say.' Basil watched him sadly. 'Well, Dorian,' he said at last, 'I won't speak of poor Sybil again. But will you come and sit for another portrait soon?' 'No. Never,' said Dorian quickly. 'It's impossible.' 'But why?' asked Basil, very surprised. 'And why have you covered the portrait?' He walked across the room towards the painting. Dorian cried out in fear, and ran between Basil and the portrait. 'No, Basil! You must not look at it. I don't want you to see it.' His face was white and angry. 'If you try to look at it, I'll never speak to you again.' The artist stared at him. 'Why can't I look at my own work?' he asked. 'I'm going to exhibit it in an art gallery in Paris soon.' Dorian tried to hide his fear. 'But you said . .. you told me that you would never exhibit the picture. Why have you changed your mind?' He came closer to Basil and looked into his face.'Tell me why,'he said. Basil turned away. After a while he said slowly, 'I see that you too have noticed something strange about the picture. Dorian, you changed my life as an artist from the moment when I met you. You became very important to me -I could not stop thinking about you. And when I painted this portrait, I felt that I'd put too much of myself into it. I could not let other people see it.' He was silent for a moment, then turned back to Dorian. 'Perhaps you're right. I cannot exhibit this picture. But will you let me look at it again?' 'No, never!' The artist smiled sadly. 'Well, I've told you my secret now. Try to understand me, Dorian. You've been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art.' As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. What a dangerous moment that had been! Poor Basil! Although he had told his own secret, he had not discovered Dorian's secret. But the picture . ... he must hide it away at once. No one must ever see it again. He had the covered portrait carried upstairs to a small room at the top of the house. Then he locked the door and kept the key himself. He felt safe now, because only his eyes would see the terrible changes in that beautiful face. When he returned to the room downstairs, he picked up a book that Lord Henry had lent him. He sat down and began to read. It was the story of a Frenchman, who had spent his life searching for beauty and pleasure pleasure of all kinds, both good and bad. Dorian read for hours. It was a frightening book, full of strange ideas and dangerous dreams -dreams that slowly became real for D o r i a n. Dorian read this book many times. In fact, he could not stop reading it, and over the years, it became more and more interesting to him. He felt that the Frenchman's life was .a mirror of his own. The Thief of Time I will be young, and strong, and beautiful for ever.' 11 nd so the years passed. But time did not touch the face of Dorian Gray. That wonderful beauty - the beauty that Basil Hallward had painted - never left him. He enjoyed the life of a rich and fashionable young man. He studied art and music, and filled his house with beautiful things from every corner of the world.,But his search for pleasure did not stop there. He became hungry for evil pleasures. He became more and more in love with the beauty of",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
"The Picture of Dorian Gray - Oscar Wilde -- Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde -- ( WeLib.org )",8,"his face, more and more interested in the ugliness of his soul. After a while strange stories were heard about him - stories of a secret, more dangerous life. But when people looked at that young and good-looking face, they could not believe the evil stories. And they still came to the famous dinners at his house, where the food, and the music, and the conversation were the best in London. But behind the locked door at the top of the house, the picture of Dorian Gray grew older every year. The terrible face showed the dark secrets of his life. The heavy mouth, the yellow skin, the cruel eyes - these told the real story. Again and again, Dorian Gray went secretly to the room and looked first at the ugly and terrible face in the picture, then at the beautiful young face that laughed back at him from the mirror. The Thief of Time As time passed, the face in the picture grew slowly more terrible. The Picture of Dorian Gray After his twenty-fifth year, the stories about him became worse. He was sometimes away from home for several days; he was seen fighting with foreign sailors in bars; he was friendly with thieves. And in the houses of fashionable people, men sometimes turned away when he entered a room. Women's faces sometimes went white when they heard his name. But many people only laughed at these stories. Dorian Gray was still a very rich and fashionable man, and the dinners at his house were excellent. People agreed with Lord Henry, who once said, in his amusing way, that a good dinner was more important than a good life. As the months and years passed, Dorian Cray grew more and more afraid of the picture. He both hated it and loved it, and he became more and more afraid that someone would discover his secret. For weeks he tried not to go near it, but he could not stay away from it for long. Sometimes, when he was staying in friends' houses, he suddenly left and hurried back to London. He wanted to be sure that the room was still locked and the picture was still safe. At one time he used to spend winters with Lord Henry in a little house in Algiers, but now he no longer travelled outside England. His fear grew stronger every year, and as time passed, the face in the picture grew slowly more terrible. The Hand of a Killer 'Uncover that picture, and you will see my soul.' 12 t was the ninth of November, the evening before his thirty-eighth birthday. Dorian Gray was walking home from Lord Henry's house when he saw Basil Hallward. He felt strangely afraid and tried to pretend that he had not seen him, but Basil hurried after him. 'Dorian!' he called. 'What extraordinary luck! I'm catching the midnight train to Paris and I wanted to see you before I left. I'll be away from England for six months.' He put his hand on Dorian's arm. 'Look, we're near your house. May I come in for a moment? I have something to say to you.' 'Of course. But won't you miss your train?' asked Dorian lazily, as he walked up the steps to his door. 'I have plenty of time. It's only eleven o'clock.' They went in and sat down by the fire. 'Now, my dear Dorian, I want to speak to you seriously,' Basil began. 'I must tell you that people in London are saying the most terrible things about you.' Dorian lit a cigarette and looked bored. 'I don't want to know anything about it. It doesn't interest me.' 'But it must interest you, Dorian,' said Basil. 'Every gentleman is interested in his good name. Of course, when I look at you, I know that these stories can't be true. A man's The Picture of Dorian Gray face shows if his life is good or bad. But why does Lord Berwick leave the room when you enter it? Why does Lord Staveley say that no honest woman is safe with you? That young soldier, who was your friend - why did he kill himself? There was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a bad name. And what about Lord Kent's son? What kind of life does he have now?' 'Stop, Basil. You don't know what you're talking about,' said Dorian coldly. 'Did I teach these people how to live their lives?; And the people who tell these stories - are their lives any better than mine?' 'And there are other stories too,' continued Basil. 'Are they true? Can your life really be so bad, so evil?

I think I would have to see your soul before I could answer those questions.' 'The real Dorian Gray?' asked Dorian quietly, his face white with fear. 'Yes,' said the artist sadly. 'But only God can see your soul.' A terrible laugh came from the younger man. 'Come, Basil,' he cried. 'Come with me! I will show you what only God can see. Why not? It's your own work. You've talked enough about evil. Now you must look at it.' He took Basil upstairs to the locked room. Inside, he turned to the artist, with smiling lips and cold, hard eyes. 'You're the one man in the world who should know my secret. Are you sure that you want to?' 'Yes.' The Hand of a Killer 'Then uncover that picture, Basil, and you will see my soul.' A cry of horror came from the artist when he saw the terrible face in the portrait. How could that evil and unlovely face be Dorian Gray's? But yes, it was. He went nearer to the picture. It could not be the portrait that he had painted. But yes there was his name written in the corner. He turned and looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man. 'What does this mean?' he asked at last. 'When you finished the portrait,' replied Dorian, 'I made a wish . . .' 'I r e m e m b e r, yes,' said Basil. 'You wished that the picture could become old, and that you could stay young. But this . . ' He stared again at the picture. This is impossible. And you told me that you'd destroyed the picture.' . . 'I was wrong. It has destroyed me.' 'My God, Dorian!' cried the artist. 'If this is true . .. If this is the face of your soul, then you are more evil than the worst of the stories about you.' He sat down at the table and put his face in his hands. 'You m u st ask God for his help.' 'It's too late, Basil.' 'It's never too late, Dorian. Look at that terrible face. Look at it!' ""Dorian turned and stared at the face in the picture, and suddenly he hated Basil more than he had ever hated anyone in his life. Basil now knew his secret, and had seen the real Dorian Gray. Violent feelings burned inside Dorian. He picked up a knife from the table. Then the hate inside him exploded, and like a wild animal, he ran towards Basil, and dug the knife into the artist's neck, again and again and The Picture of Dorian Gray The Hand of a Killer again. The murdered man's head fell forwards, and the blood ran slowly across the table, and down onto the floor. Dorian stood and listened. He could hear nothing - only the drip, drip of blood onto the floor. He went to the window and looked down into the street. He felt strangely calm. The friend who had painted his portrait had gone out of his life. That was all. He locked the door behind him and went quietly downstairs. His servants were all in bed. He sat down and began to think. No one had seen Basil in Dorian's house tonight. Paris. Yes! Basil had gone to Paris, of course, so it would be six months before people asked where he was. Six months! That was more than enough time. Dorian walked up and down the room. Then he took out a book from his desk and began to search for a name. Alan Campbell. Yes, that was the name that he wanted. 13 The next morning Dorian wrote two letters. He put one of them into his pocket, and he gave the other to his servant. 'Take this to Mr Campbell's house at once,' he said. Dorian stood and listened. He could hear nothing only the drip, drip of blood onto the floor. While Dorian waited, he picked up a book and tried to read. But after a time the book fell from his hand. Perhaps Alan Campbell was out of England. Perhaps he would refuse to come. He was a very clever scientist, and five years ago he and Dorian had been good friends. But now Alan never smiled when he met Dorian. The Picture of Dorian Gray The Hand of a Killer Each minute seemed an hour to Dorian, but at last the door opened. Dorian smiled. 'Alan!' he said. 'Thank you for coming.' 'I never wanted to enter your house again, but your letter said that it was a question of life and death,' said Alan Campbell. His voice was hard and",no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes
"The Picture of Dorian Gray - Oscar Wilde -- Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde -- ( WeLib.org )",10,"cold. 'Yes, Alan, it is. Please sit down.' Across the table the two men's eyes met. Dorian was silent for a moment; then, very quietly, he said, 'Alan, in a locked room upstairs there is a dead body. I want you to destroy it. There must be nothing left. I know you can do this.' 'Alan, in a locked room upstairs there is a dead body. I want you to destroy it.' 'I don't want to know your terrible secrets. I refuse to help you,' Campbell replied. 'But you must, Alan. You're the only person who can help me.' Dorian smiled sadly. He took a piece of paper, wrote something on it, and pushed it across the table to Campbell. As Campbell read the piece of paper, his face went white. He looked at Dorian with hate and fear in his eyes. 'I'm so sorry for you, Alan,' said. Dorian gently. 'I've already written a letter, and if you don't help me, I'll have to send it. But I think that you will help me.' Campbell put his face in his hands, and was silent for a long time. Dorian waited. ' I ' ll need some things from my house,' Campbell said at last. Dorian sent his servant to fetch the things that Campbell needed, and the two men waited silently. When the servant returned, Dorian took the scientist upstairs to the locked room. As they entered, Dorian remembered that the portrait was uncovered. He turned to cover it, then stopped and stared in horror. One of the hands in the picture was red with blood. For Dorian, this was more terrible than the dead body in the room. With shaking hands, he quickly covered the picture. 'Leave me now,' ordered Campbell. Five hours later Campbell came back downstairs. 'I've done what you asked me to do,' he said. 'And now goodbye. I never want to see you again.' When Campbell had left, Dorian went upstairs. There was a terrible smell in the room; but the dead body had gone. The Sailor 'I will find that man, and kill him like a dog.' 14 Later the same evening Dorian Gray was at a party. He smiled and talked, and looked as young and as good-looking as ever. But his head ached and at dinner he could not eat anything. When Lord Henry asked him if he felt unwell, Dorian said that he was tired and would go home early. At home he felt worse. Although the room was warm, his hands shook with cold. He wanted to forget for a while - to escape from the prison of his real life, and to lose himself in dreams. At midnight, in old dirty clothes, he left the house again and went to the East End of London. There he knew places where he could get opium - dark, evil places where people bought and sold the beautiful, terrible dreams of opium. He had been there many times before. He found the house that he was looking for and went into a long, low room. Men were lying on the dirty floor, a sailor was asleep on a table and two women were drinking at the bar. As Dorian hurried up the narrow stairs, the sweet, heavy smell of opium came to meet him and he smiled in pleasure. But in the room he saw a young man who had once been his friend. He turned away, and went downstairs again to drink at the bar. The Sailor One of the women spoke to him. 'Don't talk to me,' said Dorian angrily, and walked towards the door. 'I remember you! You're Prince Charming, aren't you?' she shouted after him. The sleeping sailor woke up when he heard these words, and as Dorian left the house, the sailor hurried after him. Dorian walked quickly along the road, but as he reached a corner, hands closed around his neck. A man pulled him backwards and pushed him against a wall. Dorian fought wildly, and pulled the hands away. Then he saw the gun in the man's hand. 'What do you want?' he said quickly. 'Keep quiet,' said the man. 'If you move, I'll shoot you.' 'You're crazy. What have I done to you?' 'You destroyed the life of Sybil Vane,' answered the sailor, 'and Sybil Vane was my sister. She killed herself because of you. I've been looking for you for years, but I only knew the name that she used to call you - Prince Charming. Well, tonight I heard your name, and tonight you're going to die.' Dorian Gray grew sick with fear. 'I never knew her. I've never heard of her. You're crazy,' he cried. Suddenly he had an idea. 'How long ago did your sister die?' he asked. 'Eighteen",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
"The Picture of Dorian Gray - Oscar Wilde -- Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde -- ( WeLib.org )",11,"years ago,' James Vane replied. 'Why do you ask me?' 'Eighteen years,' laughed Dorian Gray. Take me to the light and look at my face.' James Vane stared at Dorian. Then he pushed him towards the light, and in the light he saw the face of a boy of twenty. The Picture of Dorian Gray The Sailor This man was too young. He was not the man who had destroyed his sister's life. 'My God!' he cried. 'I nearly murdered you!' 'Go home, and put that gun away, before you get into trouble,' said Dorian. And he walked quickly away. James Vane stared after him in horror. Then a woman's hand touched his arm. 'Why didn't you kill him?' she asked. 'He's evil.' 'He's not the man that I'm looking for,' answered the sailor. 'The man who I want must be nearly forty now. That man is only a boy.' 'A boy?' The woman laughed. Her voice was hard. 'It's eighteen years since I met Prince Charming. And his pretty face hasn't changed in all that time. It's true, I promise you.' James Vane ran to the corner of the road, but Dorian Gray had disappeared. 15 A week later Dorian Gray was at his house in the country, where he had invited Lord Henry and several other friends. Among them was the pretty Lady Monmouth and her much older husband. Lady Monmouth was amusing and clever, and seemed to like Dorian Gray very much. One afternoon, as they laughed and talked together during tea, Dorian went out to fetch a flower for Lady Monmouth's dress. Lord Henry smiled at Lady Monmouth. 'I've been looking for you for years Prince Charming!' said James Vane. The Picture of Dorian Gray The Sailor 'I hope you're not in love with Dorian, my dear. He's very dangerous.' She laughed. 'Oh, men are much more interesting when they're dangerous.' Just then they heard the sound of a heavy fall. Lord Henry ran out of the room and found Dorian lying unconscious on the floor. When Dorian opened his eyes, Lord Henry said, 'My dear Dorian, you must take care of yourself. You're not well.' Dorian stood up slowly. 'I'm all right, Harry. I'm all right.' As he dressed for dinner in his room, Dorian remembered what he had seen and cold fear ran through him like a knife. He had seen a face watching him at the window and he had recognized it. It was the face of James Vane. The next day he did not leave the house. In fact, for most of the day he stayed in his room, sick with fear. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor's face. He tried to tell himself that he had dreamt it. Yes, it was impossible. Sybil Vane's brother did not know his name, and was probably on his ship at sea. No, of course he had not seen James Vane's face at the window. But the fear stayed with him, dream or no dream. Two days passed and Dorian grew less afraid. On the third day, a clear, bright winter morning, Dorian joined his friends on a shooting-party. With Lady Monmouth by his side, he walked to the edge of the forest where the men were shooting at birds and small animals. The cold air and the sounds and smells of the forest filled Dorian with happiness. Suddenly one of the men shot into the trees near them. There were two cries in the morning air - the cry of an animal and the cry of a man, both in pain. There were shouts and calls from the men, and then a man's body was pulled from the trees. Dorian turned away in horror. Bad luck seemed to follow him everywhere. A man's dead body was pulled from the trees. The Picture of Dorian Gray People began to walk back towards the house. Lord Henry came over to tell Dorian that the man was dead. Dorian shook his head. 'Oh, Harry,' he said slowly, 'I feel that something terrible is going to happen to some of us - to me, perhaps.' Lord Henry laughed at this idea. 'What could happen to you, dorian? You have everything in the world that a man can want. Forget about this accident. It was just an accident - not murder.' Then he added with a smile, 'But it would be very interesting to meet a person who had murdered somebody.' 'What a terrible thing to say!' cried Lady Monmouth. 'Don't you agree, Mr Gray? Mr Gray! Are you ill again? Your face is so white!' - Dorian smiled and tried to speak calmly? 'It's nothing,' he said quietly.'But please excuse me. I think I must go and lie down.' .

He felt that he could not stay another night in the house. Death walked there in the sunlight. He decided to return immediately to London and to visit his doctor. His servant came to pack his clothes, and while he was doing this, he told Dorian that the dead man was a sailor, but no one knew his name. 'A sailor!' cried Dorian. He jumped to his feet. A wild hope filled him. 'I must see the body at once.' He hurried to the house where the body lay, and when he uncovered the face of the dead man, he saw that it was James Vane. He cried with happiness, and knew that now he was safe. The Picture ' A face without a heart' 16 'you're going to be good?' said Lord Henry. 'Don't tell me that. You're wonderful as you are. Please don't change.' His long, white fingers played with a flower on the table. It was spring in London, and the two friends were having dinner at Lord Henry's house. Dorian Gray shook his head. 'No, Harry, I've done too many terrible things in my life, and I'm going to change. I began my good life yesterday, in the country.' 'My dear boy,' smiled .Lord Henry. 'Everybody can be good in the country. There's nothing to do in the country, so it's impossible to do anything bad. But tell me, how did you begin your good life?' 'There was a girl in a village. A very beautiful girl, an honest, country girl. She loved me, and was ready to come away with me yesterday, but I said no. I refused to destroy her young life, and I've left her as honest as I found her.' Lord Henry laughed. 'You've left her with a broken heart, you mean. How can she be happy now with a country boy, after she has known you?' 'Don't, Harry!' cried Dorian. 'Can you never be serious? I'm sorry that I told you now. Let's talk about other things. What's been happening in London?' 'Oh, people"" are still discussing poor Basil and how he The Picture of Dorian Gray The Picture disappeared. I don't know why, because there are plenty of other things that they can talk about my wife has run away with another man, Alan Campbell has killed himself . . .' 'What do you think has happened to Basil?' asked Dorian slowly. 'I've no idea,' answered Lord Henry. 'The English police report that Basil went to Paris on the midnight train on the ninth of November, but the French police say that he never arrived in Paris at all. If Basil wants to hide himself, I really don't care. And if he's dead, I don't want to think about him. Death is the only thing that really frightens me - I hate it.' 'Harry, don't people say t h a t . .. that Basil was murdered?' said Dorian. 'Some of the newspapers say so,' replied Lord Henry, 'but who would want to murder poor Basil? He wasn't clever enough to have enemies.' 'What will you say, Harry, if I tell you that I murdered Basil?' asked Dorian. He watched his friend carefully. Lord Henry smiled. 'No, my dear Dorian, murder wouldn't please you. You like a different kind of pleasure. And you should never do anything that you cannot talk about after dinner.' He lifted his coffee cup. 'What happened to the fine portrait that Basil painted of you? I haven't seen it for years. Didn't you tell me that it was stolen? What a pity!' 'Oh, I never really liked it,' said Dorian. 'I prefer not to think about it.' For a while the two men were silent. Then the older man lay back in his chair and looked at Dorian with half-closed eyes, 'Tell me how you have kept your youth and your wonderful beauty, Dorian. You must have some secret. I'm 'Tell me how you have kept your youth and your wonderful beauty, Dorian,' said Lord Henry. The Picture of Dorian Gray The Picture only ten years older than you, and I look like an old man. But you haven't changed since the day when I first met you. What a wonderful life you've had!' 'Yes,' said Dorian slowly, 'it's been wonderful, Harry, but I'm going to change it now. You don't know everything about me.' His friend smiled: 'You cannot change to me, Dorian. You and I will always be friends.' Dorian stood up. 'I'm tired tonight, Harry. I must go home. I'll see you at lunch tomorrow. Goodnight.' At the door he stopped for a moment and looked back, but then he turned and went out without another word. 17 At home",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
"The Picture of Dorian Gray - Oscar Wilde -- Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde -- ( WeLib.org )",13,"he thought about his conversation with Lord Henry. Could he really change, he wondered? He had lived an evil life, and had destroyed other people's lives as well. Was there any hope for him? Why had he ever made that wish about the picture? He had kept his youth and beauty, but he had paid a terrible price for it. His beauty had destroyed his soul. He picked up a mirror and stared at his face. What was he now? A face without a heart. Suddenly he hated his own beauty, and dropped the mirror on the floor where it broke into many small pieces. James Vane, Basil Hallward, Sybil Vane - these deaths were not important to him now. It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could change that. He must think of himself. 'Perhaps,' he thought, 'if I live a better life, the picture will become less ugly.' He remembered, the pretty village girl - he had not destroyed her young life. He had done one good thing. Perhaps the picture had already begun to look better. He went quietly upstairs to the locked room. Yes, he would live a good life, and he need not be afraid any more of the evil face of his soul. But when he uncovered the picture, he gave a cry of pain. There was no change. The face in the picture was still terrible - more hateful, if possible, than before - and the red on the hand seemed brighter, like new blood. He stared at the picture with hate and fear in his eyes. Years ago he had loved to watch it changing and growing old; now he could not sleep because of it. It had stolen every chance of peace or happiness from him. He must destroy it. He looked round and saw the knife that had killed Basil Hallward. 'Now it will kill the artist's work,' he said to himself. 'It will kill the past, and when that is dead, I will be free.' He picked up the knife and dug it into the picture. There was a terrible cry, and a loud crash. The servants woke, and two gentlemen, who were passing in the road below, stopped and looked up at the house. A policeman came by, and they asked him: 'Whose house is that?' 'Mr Dorian Gray's, sir,' was the answer. The two gentlemen looked at each other, then turned away from the house and walked on. Inside the house the servants talked in low, frightened voices. After some minutes they went up to the room. They knocked, but there was no reply. They called out. Nothing. The Picture of Dorian Gray The Picture They could not open the door, so they climbed down from the roof and got in through the window. Against the wall they saw a fine portrait of the young Dorian Gray, in all his wonderful youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, with a knife in his heart. His face was old and ugly and yellow with disease. Only the rings on his fingers told them who he was.
