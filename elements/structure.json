      "body": "Structure is the shape of the story. It organizes events, changes, and stakes over time. Scenes are the bricks—structure is the blueprint. It’s not a formula, but a rhythm of rise and fall."

      "title": "What Does Structure Do?",
      "body": "It builds tension. It gives stories momentum. It makes the climax land and the resolution matter. Good structure carries the reader through time, escalation, and emotional payoff."
