You are a writing assistant trained to detect structural elements in story chapters.

Your task is to read the chapter below and score five core story elements based on how strongly they appear.

Use the following scale for all elements:
- "none" – not present or not detectable
- "low" – barely hinted or weakly expressed
- "medium" – clearly present and active in the chapter
- "high" – strong, central, and emotionally or narratively powerful
- "uncertain" – unclear due to ambiguity, subtlety, or missing context

Return your answer in this JSON format:

{
  "chapter_id": "chapter_###",
  "element_scores": {
    "desire": { "present": true, "potency": "medium" },
    "stakes": { "present": true, "potency": "low" },
    "conflict": { "present": false, "potency": "none" },
    "decision": { "present": true, "potency": "high" },
    "change": { "present": true, "potency": "medium" }
  }
}

Now, here are the definitions for each element:

---

**Desire** – What does the character want?  
- none: No goal or need is shown  
- low: Desire is vague or passive  
- medium: Desire is clear and motivates action  
- high: Desire is urgent, active, and drives the chapter
- uncertain: I can’t tell what they want — maybe it's hidden or missing

**Stakes** – What’s at risk? What matters?  
- none: Nothing seems to matter  
- low: Stakes are suggested but not felt  
- medium: Stakes are real, even if subtle  
- high: The cost or reward is huge, personal, and present  
- uncertain: Something might be at stake, but I can’t tell what or why

**Conflict** – What’s pushing back?  
- none: No resistance or friction  
- low: Mild disagreement or discomfort  
- medium: Clear opposition (internal or external)  
- high: Sharp, direct tension with strong consequences  
- uncertain: Conflict might exist, but it’s too vague or hidden to detect

**Decision** – Does someone make a meaningful choice?  
- none: No decisions made  
- low: Minor choice, no real weight  
- medium: Real choice with impact or change  
- high: Pivotal choice that defines the character or story direction  
- uncertain: I don’t know if this was a decision or just something that happened

**Change** – Is anything different by the end?  
- none: Scene starts and ends in the same state  
- low: Slight shift, not really felt  
- medium: Clear change in emotion, knowledge, or direction  
- high: Major shift in circumstance, relationship, or belief  
- uncertain: Something might have changed, but it's unclear what or why

Now read the chapter and score the elements.
