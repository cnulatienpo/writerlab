CONFLICT
What It Is
Conflict is the collision point—where desire meets resistance, where every “I want” runs into a wall. If desire is the fuel, conflict is the spark that turns it volatile. It’s not just two people yelling, or an explosion in the third act. Conflict is everything that stops a character from getting what they want: the world, other people, themselves, or just plain bad luck. Strip away the trappings, and story is want vs. obstacle, hope vs. reality, need vs. limit. It can be violent or invisible. It can be a world war or the tension in a single look. But without conflict, there’s no movement, no change, no stakes—just a flatline.

At its core, conflict is friction. It’s a locked door, a closed heart, a harsh truth, an impossible choice. It’s the uncomfortable place where your character is forced to either push, break, adapt, or collapse. Sometimes conflict is external—a villain, a rival, a society that says “no.” Sometimes it’s internal—fear, guilt, shame, contradiction, memory. Most of the time, it’s both at once, grinding against each other, pushing the story forward.

Conflict isn’t a “scene” or a “moment.” It’s the backbone. If you know what someone wants, you know what they’re going to run into. Without something in the way, there’s no story—only a wish list. But with conflict, you get drama, energy, transformation, and the pain (or thrill) that makes it all real.

The Deep Dive: What Makes Conflict
Conflict isn’t just fighting. It’s not only good vs. evil or hero vs. villain. Real conflict is layered, complicated, and alive in every corner of story. There are four classic sources:

Character vs. Character: Two people want different things, and there’s not enough for both. (Harry vs. Voldemort, Katniss vs. The Capitol, Marge Gunderson vs. the killer.)

Character vs. Society: One person against the crowd, the system, the expectation. (Erin Brockovich vs. corporate power, Jo March vs. gender roles, Shrek vs. the world.)

Character vs. Nature/World: The world itself is the problem—survival, disaster, disease, fate. (Mark Watney in The Martian, the shark in Jaws, nature in The Revenant.)

Character vs. Self: The deepest, rawest, often most relatable. Fear, addiction, shame, trauma, contradiction. (BoJack Horseman, Fleabag, Elsa in Frozen, Hamlet.)

But most stories braid these together—external battles feeding inner ones, and vice versa. Conflict is the friction between desire and what blocks it, but also the friction inside the person—the parts that fight, deny, or sabotage.

Sometimes conflict is loud: a showdown, a betrayal, a fight. Sometimes it’s silent: a lie, a stare, a secret kept for years. Sometimes it’s both at once. But it always, always matters.

Why Conflict Matters
Without conflict, you have a list of things that happened, not a story. Conflict is what gives events weight—what makes a win feel like relief or triumph, what makes a loss hurt, what makes a choice matter. It’s how you keep the reader hooked, scene by scene, paragraph by paragraph.

Conflict is also what reveals character. When someone is pushed, you see what’s real—what they’ll fight for, what they’ll let go, what lines they’ll cross or hold. It exposes motive, fear, loyalty, secret hunger, true weakness. The person who smiles until someone challenges them, the friend who disappears when shit gets hard, the villain who folds when shown kindness—all revealed by conflict.

Conflict creates stakes. If nothing stands in the way, then nothing is at risk. Conflict says: this costs something. You could lose. You might get hurt. You might have to change, or admit you were wrong, or destroy something you love to get what you want.

Without conflict, readers and viewers drift. They sense nothing can go wrong. They stop caring, because the outcome is never in doubt, and the struggle is never real. With conflict, everything’s alive.

Why Most Stories Fail Without It
You know the feeling: you’re reading or watching and everything just slides by. The prose might be pretty. The characters might be quirky. But nothing hooks you, because nothing is being tested. Maybe there’s a goal, but no real obstacle—just a series of events. Maybe the “conflict” is an afterthought, or never actually threatens the main want. You close the book, leave the theater, turn off the show, and forget it ever existed.

Stories fall flat when conflict is too soft, too distant, too easy to overcome, or when it never evolves. If a character wants something and always gets it, or if the world never says “no,” you don’t have a story—you have a wish-fulfillment fantasy. And unless it’s yours, you probably don’t care.

Conflict also fails when it’s just noise—fights for no reason, drama that doesn’t come from what people actually want or fear. Real conflict is specific. It’s about this character, this moment, this risk. If conflict feels tacked on, mechanical, or disconnected from the heart of the story, the whole thing collapses.

How Conflict Is Often Misunderstood
A lot of writers think conflict means “make characters yell at each other.” Or “add a villain.” Or “put in a big set-piece.” But that’s surface. Conflict isn’t just opposition for opposition’s sake. It’s about the collision of genuine wants, needs, values, or fears. Sometimes it’s quiet. Sometimes it’s brutal. Sometimes the best conflict is inside one person—wanting and not wanting, loving and resenting at the same time.

Some writers dodge conflict because it feels artificial, or “mean,” or they don’t want their characters to suffer. But a story where nothing is risked, nothing is lost, and nothing hurts is a story that never moves. Conflict is the place where you show what matters—where the mask cracks, where the person is revealed.

Other writers mistake conflict for plot twists. They add surprises but forget to make the struggle meaningful. Conflict is about the meaning of struggle, not just the existence of it.

Conflict is not an interruption—it’s the pulse.

How Conflict Powers Everything
Desire: Without resistance, want is easy. With conflict, want gets tested, twisted, sharpened.

Theme: What your character fights for (or gives up) shows what the story really means.

Plot: Every turn, every setback, every reversal is a new collision of want and obstacle.

Scene: Every scene has a power dynamic—a negotiation, a risk, a test.

Voice: Conflict gives the writing edge, urgency, rhythm, and truth.

Conflict is why anything in a story feels real.

The Many Faces of Conflict
Conflict isn’t just “I want X, you want Y.” It’s:

Competing desires in the same person (love vs. duty, hope vs. fear).

Silent sabotage—characters who undermine themselves or others out of jealousy, shame, or panic.

Comedy born of misunderstanding or misalignment (The Office, Schitt’s Creek, Brooklyn Nine-Nine).

Tragedy from the world being what it is (12 Years a Slave, Brokeback Mountain).

The war between truth and lie (Breaking Bad, Succession, Game of Thrones).

The mess of family, friendship, romance, loyalty, betrayal, regret.

Conflict is everywhere: in the rules, the weather, the past, the body, the mind. Every story you love is built on layers of it.

The Writer’s Job
Your job is not to avoid conflict, but to lean into it. Make it real, make it hurt, make it mean something. If it’s hidden, show the cracks. If it’s obvious, raise the stakes. Track how it changes. If you know what every character wants—and what’s in the way, outside and inside—you’ll never run out of scenes, never run out of risk.

Push your characters to the wall. Don’t rescue them too soon. The reader is there for the fight.


You Know What It’s Like to Face Conflict
Let’s cut through the noise: you already understand conflict because you’ve survived it—hell, you’re probably living it right now. You know what it’s like to want something and run face-first into a wall. Maybe you’ve fought with family, lost friends, been boxed in by the system, or spent years wrestling with your own mind. You’ve held back words you wanted to say, burned bridges you wish you hadn’t, lied to protect yourself, or risked everything for something you needed. Maybe you’ve been the villain in someone else’s story, or found out too late that you were fighting yourself the whole time.

You don’t need to be taught what conflict feels like. You know what it is to want, and to be stopped. You know what it’s like to have two impossible choices, to bite your tongue, to slam a door, to wish the world were different. You’ve hurt people and been hurt, picked fights and tried to avoid them, lost battles no one else even saw. Conflict is the air you breathe as a human being; it’s the reason you get out of bed, the reason you lie awake at night, the reason you keep showing up for life even when it’s brutal.

Every time you write, you’re writing your own wars. The stories that matter—the ones that stick—are built from the friction in your own life. You don’t have to fake it or manufacture drama: you just have to be honest. Whether you’re blowing up cities or writing two people staring each other down across a table, it’s all the same. Conflict is the crackle of living. You get it. You’ve lived it. That’s why you can write it.

Every story you create is about someone colliding with the world, with someone else, or with themselves—sometimes all at once. Your job isn’t to invent conflict, it’s to recognize it and let it burn on the page.

How to Spot Conflict in the Wild
1. They SAY What the Problem Is

Sometimes, conflict walks right up and tells you its name. A character (or narrator) lays it out—what’s wrong, who’s in the way, what hurts, what’s broken, what they’re fighting for or against. This is the surface-level, no-bullshit version: the obstacle or opposition is spoken out loud, written into the dialogue, or even thrown in the reader’s face through narration. No subtext, no puzzle—just the problem, announced for all to see. You don’t have to guess where the tension is coming from; they hand it to you.

What Does It Look Like?
It could be an argument where someone shouts, “You’re always trying to control me!” It might be a whispered confession (“I’m scared I’ll never be good enough”), or a battle speech (“We will not go quietly into the night!”). Sometimes it’s a complaint, sometimes a threat, sometimes a desperate plea. Maybe it’s someone admitting they hate their job, love the wrong person, or can’t stand the person next to them. When conflict is spoken, the air shifts—everyone knows what’s at stake, what the fight is, what has to be faced.

Why Writers Use It
Letting a character say what the conflict is does a couple of things. First, it makes the stakes crystal clear for the audience—no guessing games, no ambiguity. You know who’s on what side, what the stakes are, and why everything matters. Spoken conflict draws a line in the sand. It raises the heat instantly because you know a confrontation is coming (or already here). Sometimes, having the characters admit what the fight is about forces everyone—including the audience—to stop pretending and actually deal with the mess.

What to Listen For
Direct accusations: “You lied to me.” / “This is all your fault.”

Ultimatums: “If you walk out that door, don’t come back.”

Stated fears: “I’m afraid you don’t love me anymore.”

Declarations of war: “I won’t let you win.” / “Over my dead body.”

Vulnerable admissions: “I can’t keep pretending everything’s okay.”

Announced rivalries: “I’ve always wanted to beat you.”

Simple, honest confession: “We can’t go on like this.”

Why It Matters
Spoken conflict gives you a spotlight. You know exactly what the story is wrestling with—no hidden agendas (yet). Every action, every bit of tension, every side-eye or slammed door can be traced back to this moment. The plot now has direction: you know what’s at risk, who’s got something to lose, and who’s in the way. It makes characters vulnerable, too. Saying “this is what’s wrong” is a risk; it opens the door to being hurt, challenged, or changed. The fallout is instant—once you say the fight out loud, there’s no stuffing it back in the box.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

The Lord of the Rings — Frodo to Sam: “I can’t do this, Sam.” (Says the conflict—overwhelmed, at the edge, naming the struggle directly.)

Breaking Bad — Skyler to Walt: “I’m afraid of you.” (No more pretending; the fear is the conflict.)

Frozen — Elsa: “You can’t marry a man you just met!” (Calling out the real tension, refusing to play along.)

The Hunger Games — Katniss: “If we burn, you burn with us!” (Declares open war, shifts the power.)

The Office — Jim to Michael: “You’re not my friend. You’re my boss.” (Honest conflict in the open, breaking all the subtext.)

Game of Thrones — Cersei: “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.” (Announces the whole show’s conflict in a single line.)

Spider-Man 2 — Peter Parker to Aunt May: “I’m Spider-Man. No more secrets.” (The conflict between truth and safety is spoken.)

Fleabag — Priest to Fleabag: “Why do you keep using sex to avoid real intimacy?” (Names the root conflict, making the next move unavoidable.)

Star Wars — Luke to Vader: “I’ll never join you!” (Clear, stated opposition.)

Succession — Kendall Roy: “I’m better than you.” (Every episode is built on saying the quiet part loud.)

How It Changes the Story
When the conflict is out in the open, the tension gets teeth. Everyone in the story (and the reader) knows the real terms. There’s no more playing nice. The path ahead is all about dealing with this declared war, hurt, or challenge. Sometimes, the moment a conflict is spoken is the moment everything else becomes possible—resolution, escalation, collapse.

Characters who say what the problem is can’t hide behind jokes or politeness anymore. They risk real change. The air is charged, and the fallout can be huge: relationships break, alliances shift, the truth is unavoidable.

For Writers
Don’t be afraid to let your characters name the fight. Let them say what hurts, what scares them, what they want to destroy or protect. Direct conflict doesn’t make a story less deep—it makes it urgent and honest. And the sooner you get it out there, the sooner you can let the real chaos begin.


How to Spot Conflict in the Wild
2. They SHOW What the Problem Is

Conflict doesn’t have to be shouted or spelled out. Most of the time, you’ll see it: in what characters do, what they refuse to do, the boundaries they set, the lines they cross, the ways they grind against each other (or the world). Sometimes no one ever says what’s wrong, but the actions—the friction, avoidance, sabotage, open defiance—shout it at full volume. The war is in the way they move, the choices they make, the trouble they invite or run from. Conflict leaks out, leaks in, changes the air around every character.

What Does It Look Like?
You spot it in their reactions—tense shoulders, storming out, slamming doors, silent treatments, sharp glances. Conflict is in the patterns: two people who always argue, a hero who can’t stop breaking rules, a family who only shows up at holidays to fight about the past. It’s what people won’t do—refusing to apologize, refusing to ask for help, refusing to show up. Sometimes it’s in the sabotage: a character undermines their own success, burns bridges, pushes people away before they can be left. Maybe someone picks a fight just to feel alive. Maybe a group closes ranks when an outsider appears. The fight is everywhere except the dialogue.

Why Writers Use It
Showing conflict, rather than saying it, pulls the reader into the world—no spoon-feeding, no neon signs, just tension you feel. The story gains depth and danger because the reader gets to piece it together, tracking the patterns, watching the fallout, knowing something’s going to break. This is where stories breathe: in what’s not said but what can’t be avoided. Showing conflict lets you layer subtext, complexity, and makes the audience do a little detective work (which is always more satisfying).

What to Watch For
Patterned resistance: Characters always saying no, dragging their feet, making everything harder than it needs to be.

Silent stand-offs: Tense meals, awkward car rides, long pauses.

Sabotage: Doing things that make the problem worse, even (especially) when it doesn’t make sense.

Repeated arguments: Fighting about little things when the big problem is left unsaid.

Physical actions: Slamming doors, walking away, breaking something valuable, refusing to leave or refusing to stay.

Third-party conflict: Using someone else to fight your battles—gossip, triangulation, picking sides.

Risky choices: Going behind someone’s back, defying orders, making bold moves that provoke opposition.

Small rebellions: Not answering calls, “forgetting” an important date, doing something out of spite or self-defense.

Why It Matters
Conflict shown through action is what makes a story feel real, alive, and full of stakes. You don’t need a speech to sense the heat in the room. Readers get to participate, connecting the dots, reading the air. This is how real life works: most fights aren’t announced, they’re acted out, lived through, felt in the gut. When a character shows their struggle, you can’t look away—you want to know what’s really going on, what the next explosion will be, whether anyone will make it out clean.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

Fargo — Jerry and his wife: Every scene is tense, even when nobody’s yelling. Jerry’s secrets show up in his lies, awkwardness, and desperation.

The Godfather — Michael Corleone: His choices—who he protects, who he hurts, who he refuses to become—show his conflict with his family and himself.

Mad Men — Don Draper: His constant cheating, working late, and avoiding honest conversations show an endless, internal war.

The Office — Angela and Dwight: Their secret, on-again-off-again relationship is a war of gestures, furtive glances, petty sabotage.

Fleabag: The protagonist’s actions—sabotaging relationships, chasing chaos—constantly show her inner turmoil, without needing to spell it out.

Black Panther — T’Challa and Killmonger: Most of their conflict is in what they do—choosing sides, making risky moves, breaking tradition.

Get Out — Chris: The tension is all in the way people act around him—too nice, too invasive, too interested.

The Simpsons — Bart vs. Lisa: Their fights are more about pranks, sabotage, and silent wars than about what’s actually said.

BoJack Horseman: Characters hurt each other through neglect, self-destruction, and distance.

Euphoria — Rue and Jules: They never really say what’s wrong, but their decisions—staying, leaving, running, chasing—show all the fractures.

The Crown: Every episode is a masterclass in people refusing to say what’s wrong but living out the conflict anyway—through cold shoulders, missed events, or passive-aggressive tradition.

How It Changes the Story
When conflict is shown, not told, the story fills with suspense and subtext. You don’t have the answers, but you know something’s coming. It’s more satisfying for the reader—they get to watch the storm build, feel the pressure rise, and wonder when (or if) anyone will finally snap. Sometimes this keeps the story simmering for ages; sometimes the slow-burn is the point. When someone finally says what the problem is, it lands with ten times the force, because you’ve felt it all along.

For Writers
Let your characters act out the fight. Make them sabotage their own happiness, push away the people they love, pick fights with the world or themselves. Show the grind, the friction, the tiny rebellions and epic disasters. The best stories are built on what’s acted, not announced. If you can make the reader sense the conflict without a single speech, you’re halfway to a story that lives.

3. They HIDE What the Problem Is

Not all conflict comes out swinging. Sometimes it’s buried—denied, camouflaged, or kept under lock and key. This is the sneakiest, most human kind of conflict: knowing there’s a problem, but doing anything not to face it, not to let anyone else see it, maybe not even letting yourself know it’s there. The result? A story full of tension, odd silences, weird detours, and pressure that never quite releases. Hidden conflict is where real drama cooks.

What Does It Look Like?
Hidden conflict lurks in the gaps—awkward pauses, the joke that lands flat, the way two people never quite look each other in the eye. You see it in characters who dodge questions, change the subject, over-explain simple things, or go out of their way to avoid someone. Maybe they attack a “safe” target instead of the real one, or lose their shit over nothing because they can’t name what’s really wrong. Sometimes they drown in distractions—work, habits, helping others, busy-ness—to keep from thinking about the problem. Maybe they start a pointless argument just to avoid the one that matters.

This is the fight that happens under the fight. No one ever says what the real issue is, but everyone feels it—the tension, the stakes, the threat that something could snap at any second.

Why Writers Use It
Hidden conflict is a goldmine for tension and realism. Real people rarely name their fights outright, especially the big, scary ones. We hide, we deflect, we use humor, we get mean, we sabotage, we freeze. Burying the fight keeps the story humming with subtext, suspense, and surprise—it forces the audience to read between the lines, wonder when the dam will break, and stay tuned for the truth underneath all the noise.

What to Watch For
Avoidance: Characters dodge each other, skip events, or change the subject whenever the real issue comes up.

Deflection: Picking smaller, unrelated fights. (“Why are you always late?” instead of “I’m scared you’ll leave me.”)

Overcompensation: Acting too nice, too cold, too busy, too perfect to cover up the mess.

Distraction: Pouring energy into work, hobbies, caretaking—anything to keep from facing the conflict.

Passive aggression: Snide remarks, the silent treatment, doing what’s asked—but badly.

Guilt trips: Making someone else feel bad so you don’t have to talk about what’s actually wrong.

Self-sabotage: Messing things up “by accident” so the conflict never comes to a head.

Breaking routines: Sudden changes—someone stops calling, skips dinner, starts new habits overnight.

Why It Matters
Hidden conflict is where stories get real, complicated, and dangerous. It’s not just what’s said, but what’s left unsaid that twists a relationship, keeps a family at war, or turns a workplace toxic. Every scene gets a charge, because everyone is on edge, waiting for the unspoken bomb to go off. The longer the fight stays hidden, the more power it has—when it finally breaks loose, the results are explosive, heartbreaking, or cathartic as hell.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

The Sopranos — Tony and Carmela: Their fights are rarely about what’s on the surface—most arguments are stand-ins for deeper betrayal, resentment, and loneliness.

Breaking Bad — Walt and Skyler: They dance around the truth for seasons—avoiding, lying, distracting, pretending nothing’s wrong even as everything falls apart.

Succession: Every character’s real fight is buried under sarcasm, jokes, and business talk; nobody says what they mean, but you can cut the tension with a knife.

The Royal Tenenbaums: The family’s weirdness, silence, and sabotage all mask a deep, shared wound nobody will name.

The Great Gatsby: The parties and drama are distractions; the real conflict—class, love, loss—simmers beneath the surface.

Lady Bird: The fights between Lady Bird and her mom are full of jokes, avoidance, and sudden blow-ups—never directly about the real pain underneath.

Ted Lasso (Rebecca and her ex-husband): She hides her anger and heartbreak behind professionalism and little power moves.

The West Wing — CJ and her dad: The conflict isn’t named—it’s all in what isn’t said, what’s avoided, and the rituals they use to cope.

Moonlight: Chiron rarely speaks about what’s hurting him, but every scene shows what he’s running from.

How It Changes the Story
Hidden conflict is a pressure cooker. The story builds and builds, simmering with scenes where nothing seems to happen—except for everything underneath. When the truth finally comes out, everything changes: relationships break, heal, or transform. Even if it never surfaces, that unresolved tension shapes every moment, every choice, every regret.

For Writers
Write the silence. Build scenes where the real fight is always lurking just outside the frame. Let your characters distract, joke, freeze, lash out, retreat—anything but say what’s really going on. The more your story lives in the unsaid, the more it feels like real life. And when the truth finally cracks through, let it break something open.


Potency Levels: Low — The Gentle Strain
What Low Potency Conflict Is
Low-potency conflict is the quiet tension that simmers beneath the surface. It’s not a fight, not a crisis—more like a pressure in the air, a vague sense that something’s off, or an unspoken difference that keeps people from fully connecting. Maybe it’s a disagreement left unaddressed, a feeling of not quite fitting in, or a clash of values that never erupts into argument. Most of the time, neither side would call it a conflict at all. It’s the weight of politeness, the itch of unsaid things, the hesitation before reaching out.

In low-potency mode, conflict doesn’t drive the plot forward—it colors the emotional world. It creates layers, moods, a hint of friction or melancholy, a subtle sense of distance between people. It isn’t nothing; it’s the thread that might snap, the question that might get asked, the silence before the storm.

How It Shows Up in Characters
Awkward silences: Conversations stall or shift topic just before things get real.

Subtle avoidance: Characters keep busy, dodge each other, or let messages go unanswered.

Microaggressions: Small jabs, jokes, or passive comments hint at underlying issues.

Walking on eggshells: Characters act extra careful, checking themselves before they speak.

Minor irritations: Sighing, eye-rolling, snark, or gentle teasing that never turns mean.

Withdrawal: Someone pulls back—physically or emotionally—without explanation.

Routine over truth: The familiar is chosen over the honest, keeping everything running smoothly but a little off.

Story Effects of Low-Potency Conflict
Sets a Mood: The story feels a little tense, uncertain, or bittersweet. Readers sense something unresolved, even when everyone acts “fine.”

Builds Relatability: It’s real—most of life is this, not screaming matches. We all know what it’s like to keep the peace while something festers.

Foreshadows Trouble or Change: This is often the canary in the coal mine. That subtle strain hints at bigger conflicts that could break through if the right pressure hits.

Deepens Character: People with quiet struggles feel more honest. They aren’t just bouncing off plot points; their inner world matters. Their caution or frustration, even if muted, makes them more believable.

What It Feels Like to Write
You linger: Scenes last a little longer, with pauses and unsaid things hanging in the air.

Dialogue skirts the issue: People hint, joke, or sidestep the real subject.

Action is small-scale: Nobody flips a table—they just forget a birthday, or stand at the edge of a group.

Pacing is gentle: There’s room to breathe, to notice how a glance or sigh changes everything.

Pop Culture Examples
Pam Beesly (The Office):
Her engagement to Roy is all low-grade conflict—quiet disappointment, unspoken doubts, halfhearted plans. Most of it shows up in silence, stolen glances, and what she doesn’t say.

Charlotte (Lost in Translation):
Her marriage feels strained, but there are almost no fights—just silences, distant phone calls, and missed connections. The conflict is all subtext.

My Neighbor Totoro (Mei & Satsuki’s family):
The sisters and their father navigate worry and longing with only minor flare-ups—the real strain is in missing their mother and trying to stay upbeat.

Jim Hopper (Stranger Things, early episodes):
His frustration with the town and his own grief comes out as mild irritation and avoidance, never open anger—at first.

Gilmore Girls (Lorelai and her parents):
Most conflict is low-key—awkward dinners, comments left hanging, politeness barely masking deep difference.

Kiki (Kiki’s Delivery Service):
Kiki feels out of place in her new town. The conflict is all internal—doubt, loneliness, the quiet push to belong.

Steven (Steven Universe, early on):
He senses the Gems are hiding things, but his struggle is gentle—hints, questions, soft tensions as he tries to find his place.

When to Use Low Potency as a Writer
When you want to build atmosphere and intimacy before things boil over.

When your story is about relationships, coming-of-age, or the day-to-day struggles that shape people.

When you want to show how conflict isn’t always loud—sometimes it’s the quiet strain that changes everything.

When the story is about restraint, not eruption; about holding it together, not breaking apart.

What Keeps Conflict Low?
Fear: Rocking the boat might cost too much.

Politeness: People don’t want to hurt each other, so they hold back.

Habit: They’re used to avoiding problems.

Denial: If you don’t talk about it, maybe it’ll go away.

Complacency: “Good enough” feels safer than being honest.

How Low Conflict Can Change
A new pressure—a guest, a secret, a mistake—can raise the stakes from gentle strain to open confrontation.

Sometimes it stays low, and the story becomes about living with tension, letting go, or finding quiet acceptance.

Sometimes, just one honest conversation is enough to change everything.

Low conflict is the heartbeat under the words.
Write it with nuance, patience, and respect for the ways people tiptoe around each other.
Let it simmer.
It’s how most stories start.

## Potency Levels: Medium — The Friction Point

### What Medium Potency Conflict Is

Medium-potency conflict is where friction turns into force. This isn’t a quiet strain or a background vibe—this is conflict stepping into the light. Now, something real stands in the way. The characters start pushing back, lines are drawn, and choices have consequences. This is where arguments happen, alliances shift, and risks are taken. It’s not all-out war, but nobody’s coasting anymore.

Medium conflict is about movement and escalation: not explosive, but undeniable. The air crackles. Every decision risks a reaction, every word might tip the balance. This is the story’s heartbeat getting faster—the middle act, where things get complicated and messy.

---

### How It Shows Up in Characters

* **Direct Confrontations:** Arguments, debates, pointed questions. People call each other out, challenge assumptions, or refuse to back down.
* **Taking Sides:** Characters start forming teams, building alliances, or drawing battle lines—sometimes openly, sometimes in secret.
* **Escalating Stakes:** Actions have visible consequences. The stakes go from “might be awkward” to “something could break.”
* **Active Avoidance:** Dodging someone, ghosting, or passive-aggressive behavior—there’s real energy behind not dealing with the problem.
* **Testing Boundaries:** Characters push rules, question authority, or take calculated risks.
* **Negotiation:** Compromise, bargaining, or manipulation—people try to get what they want, but now it costs something.

---

### Story Effects of Medium-Potency Conflict

**Builds Momentum:** Conflict now drives the story forward, not just flavoring it. Every clash changes something.

**Reveals Character:** You see what people will risk or fight for, and how they handle pressure.

**Heats Up Relationships:** Tension simmers—friendships strain, romances spark or fizzle, enemies become personal.

**Sharpens Stakes:** The reader feels what’s at risk, and that losing matters.

**Links Events:** Scenes connect—one fight leads to another, consequences stack up, and plotlines intertwine.

---

### What It Feels Like to Write

* **Scenes Snap:** Dialogue is sharper, actions are bolder. There’s more energy—less coasting, more conflict.
* **Emotional Peaks:** Hope, fear, anger, relief. You get to play with the full range of emotion as people bump up against each other.
* **Chain Reaction:** Choices have ripple effects. The outcome of one scene pushes the next.
* **Real Fallout:** No more “safe” space—someone is hurt, insulted, inspired, or changed by what happens.

---

### Pop Culture Examples

**Jim Halpert vs. Dwight Schrute (The Office):**
Their rivalry moves from low-key pranks to confrontations, sabotage, and loyalty tests. Every season, the stakes get higher.

**Hermione, Ron, and Harry (Harry Potter):**
Their friendship is tested by jealousy, misunderstandings, and differing priorities—especially in the later books.

**Katniss and Peeta (The Hunger Games):**
Alliances and betrayals become real, survival depends on choices, and even love gets weaponized.

**Troy and Gabriella (High School Musical 2):**
Conflicts between friendship, ambition, and romance heat up. Choices have consequences, and loyalties are tested.

**Moana vs. Her Father (Moana):**
Their conflict moves from “don’t go past the reef” to open argument and finally, defiance and change.

**Peter Parker (Spider-Man):**
He clashes with friends, mentors, and villains—juggling loyalty, secrecy, and the urge to do good.

**The Breakfast Club:**
Medium conflict is everywhere—misunderstandings, open arguments, and shifting alliances drive every scene.

---

### When to Use Medium Potency as a Writer

* When you want the story to build heat and speed—no more drifting.
* When relationships need to be tested, bent, or redefined.
* When you want characters to be brave, messy, or reveal what matters most.
* When the plot needs a reason to keep moving—characters push, and the world pushes back.

---

### What Keeps Conflict at Medium?

* **Doubt:** No one’s sure they’re right, or if the fight is worth it.
* **Fear of Going Too Far:** People risk hurt but aren’t ready to burn it all down.
* **Social Pressure:** There’s pushback, but not open rebellion—yet.
* **Mixed Feelings:** Wanting two things at once, torn loyalties.
* **Uncertainty:** Stakes are high, but consequences aren’t catastrophic…yet.

---

### How Medium Conflict Can Change

A spark—a betrayal, disaster, or victory—can ramp conflict up to high.
If characters retreat or back down, tension can slide back to low.

Sometimes the story is about escalation, sometimes it’s about learning to pull back before everything breaks.

Medium conflict is the heat before the boil.
Write it with energy, honesty, and an eye for the ways people collide.
Let it breathe, but don’t let it stall.
It’s the engine that keeps the story burning.

Here’s the parallel entry for **High Potency Conflict: The All-Out War**—matching your word count, depth, and vibe.

---

## Potency Levels: High — The All-Out War

### What High Potency Conflict Is

High-potency conflict is chaos unleashed—a clash so intense it takes over everything. There’s no “side plot,” no safe ground, no neutral party. The lines are drawn, the bridges are burned, and what’s at stake is nothing less than everything: loyalty, identity, love, survival, maybe even the world itself. High conflict rewrites the rules, upends every relationship, and forces characters into corners. If medium conflict is a bonfire, high is a wildfire—consuming, transforming, leaving nothing untouched.

This is the level where people fight to win or to destroy, not just to be right. Motives are naked, power dynamics shift with every move, and consequences are huge and permanent. Someone’s going down. The story can’t help but race to the climax.

---

### How It Shows Up in Characters

* **Open War:** Characters take bold, irreversible actions—betrayals, ultimatums, violence, declarations of love or hate.
* **Total Sacrifice:** Nothing is held back. Reputations, relationships, and even lives are risked or lost in the struggle.
* **Personal Meltdown:** People unravel—breakdowns, confessions, rage, and regret spill out in raw, public moments.
* **Black-and-White Thinking:** All nuance is gone. It’s us vs. them, right vs. wrong, now or never.
* **Desperation Moves:** Last-ditch efforts, wild gambles, big reveals. People will do anything to win—or to stop the other side.
* **Collateral Damage:** Innocent bystanders, entire systems, or worlds get caught in the crossfire.

---

### Story Effects of High-Potency Conflict

**Explosive Plot:** Every scene is dialed up. Cliffhangers, reversals, big showdowns—there’s no downtime.

**Irreversible Consequences:** When it’s over, nothing is the same. Losses are real, victories are costly, and scars don’t fade.

**Moral Blur:** Heroes make villain moves, villains get their humanity, and lines between right and wrong get smeared.

**Audience Hooked:** Stakes are so high, the reader has to see how it ends—even if it hurts.

**Everything Breaks:** Relationships fracture, families implode, systems collapse. This is the point of no return.

---

### What It Feels Like to Write

* **Every Scene Is a Climax:** No filler, no filler—just wave after wave of escalation.
* **Dialogue Burns:** Shouts, breakdowns, confessions, lies and truths that cut deep. Nobody’s polite.
* **Characters Snap:** They betray, confess, or finally say the thing they’ve buried for years.
* **Scenes Are Unstable:** The story shakes—anyone can turn, anything can happen.

---

### Pop Culture Examples

**Breaking Bad (Walter vs. Jesse, final season):**
All loyalty is shattered, violence erupts, and the only way out is total destruction.

**Avengers: Infinity War & Endgame:**
Friendships, lives, and even the universe itself are on the line. Alliances break, heroes fall, and nobody walks away unchanged.

**Macbeth (Shakespeare):**
Bloodshed, paranoia, madness. Everyone is either a casualty or a conspirator by the end.

**Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (Obi-Wan vs. Anakin):**
Mentor and student become mortal enemies—love turns to hatred, the world splits in two.

**Game of Thrones (Red Wedding, Battle for King’s Landing):**
Every grudge, alliance, and secret explodes. Nobody is safe; nothing is sacred.

**The Godfather, Part II:**
Michael’s war with his enemies (and his own family) leaves him alone—he wins, but loses his soul.

**Hamilton (Burr vs. Hamilton):**
Rivalry, ambition, and personal grievances erupt in a duel that ends one life and breaks another.

**Scarface (final act):**
Tony Montana destroys everything around him in his quest for power—he can’t stop until it’s all gone.

---

### When to Use High Potency as a Writer

* For finales, breaking points, and revolutions.
* When you want the story to be unforgettable—even if it hurts.
* When you want to see what happens when people can’t walk away.
* For stories about obsession, downfall, or impossible stakes.

---

### What Pushes Conflict to High?

* **Betrayal:** Trust shatters, and there’s no turning back.
* **Desperation:** It’s win or die—characters have nothing left to lose.
* **Ultimate Threat:** Something too precious to risk is threatened.
* **Escalation:** Every attempt to fix things just makes it worse.
* **Truth Exposed:** Secrets come out, forcing confrontation at any cost.

---

### How High Conflict Can Change

* Someone wins, but the victory is pyrrhic—what’s left is ash.
* The conflict ends in loss, death, or exile, and survivors must rebuild.
* Rarely, someone finds grace or a new beginning—but only after everything else is gone.

High conflict is nuclear.
Use it when you want to test what’s left standing after the storm.
Let it rip. Let it hurt.
See what breaks, and what (or who) survives the fire.

**Tools for Actively Controlling Potency Levels: Quick Reference**

---

### 1. Escalation and De-escalation

* **Raise Potency:**
  Drop a bomb in their path—a deadline, new rival, higher stakes, or unexpected twist. Force a choice with real cost.
  *Ex:* Pam’s engagement in *The Office* suddenly spikes Jim’s passive longing into bold, risky action.

* **Lower Potency:**
  Offer escape routes—distractions, comfort, disappointments, or a reason to let go. Let the world cool things down.
  *Ex:* After a big heartbreak, your character checks out, tells themselves they never really cared.

---

### 2. Change the Stakes

* **Bigger Consequences = Higher Potency**
  Wanting coffee? Low. Wanting to save a life? High.
  As the risk or reward grows, so does the need.

---

### 3. Play With Resistance

* **More Resistance:**
  Block the path. Add conflict, rivals, rules, guilt, or fear.
  Want + Friction = Heat.

* **Less Resistance:**
  Remove obstacles, make the want easy—desire cools, maybe fades out.
  No friction = no story.

---

### 4. Expose or Conceal the Want

* **Expose:**
  Desire goes public—now it’s risky, vulnerable, volatile.
  *Ex:* Secret crush becomes public confession.

* **Conceal:**
  If the want stays private, it simmers—unless the world turns up the heat.

---

### 5. Mix Internal and External Pressures

* Let the inside and outside worlds collide. Maybe your character is chill… until someone else wants the same thing, or threatens to take it away. Sparks fly.

---

### 6. Let Desire Shift Over Time

* **Potency is a spectrum:**
  Quiet want at first, tension builds, crisis hits—desire peaks.
  Show how setbacks, failures, and victories change the temperature.

---

### 7. Use Symbolic Objects/Actions

* Small gesture = small want (holding a letter, scrolling a feed).
  Big gesture = big want (sending the letter, storming a stage).
  Rituals and objects can “measure” desire on the page.

---

### 8. Physical and Emotional Signals

* **Low:** silence, staring, small talk, drifting.
* **Medium:** risk, confession, argument, visible stress.
* **High:** obsession, meltdown, yelling, ultimatums, burned bridges.

---

### 9. Other Characters Can Turn the Dial

* Allies stoke desire (“Go for it!”), rivals raise the stakes, mentors warn, family guilts.
  Desire always lives in a social ecosystem.

---

**Questions to Ask as You Write:**

* What does my character want—right now?
* How bad is the burn?
* What would push them to act (or to stop)?
* What stands in their way—and does it matter?
* What’s the real cost if they fail?
* If they win, is it enough—or does a new want show up?

---

**Dial Examples:**

* *Low → Medium*: Watching from afar → crush leaves soon, so they make a move.
* *Medium → High*: Wants promotion → rival cheats, so risks it all.
* *High → Low*: Obsessed with revenge → lets go, finds peace (or just collapses).

---

**Bottom line:**
Potency is a dial, not a switch. Scene by scene, you control the heat. If the story stalls, just ask:
**“How badly do they want it—right now? What would turn it up, or cool it down?”**



CONFLICT
What It Is
Conflict is the collision point—where desire meets resistance, where every “I want” runs into a wall. If desire is the fuel, conflict is the spark that turns it volatile. It’s not just two people yelling, or an explosion in the third act. Conflict is everything that stops a character from getting what they want: the world, other people, themselves, or just plain bad luck. Strip away the trappings, and story is want vs. obstacle, hope vs. reality, need vs. limit. It can be violent or invisible. It can be a world war or the tension in a single look. But without conflict, there’s no movement, no change, no stakes—just a flatline.

At its core, conflict is friction. It’s a locked door, a closed heart, a harsh truth, an impossible choice. It’s the uncomfortable place where your character is forced to either push, break, adapt, or collapse. Sometimes conflict is external—a villain, a rival, a society that says “no.” Sometimes it’s internal—fear, guilt, shame, contradiction, memory. Most of the time, it’s both at once, grinding against each other, pushing the story forward.

Conflict isn’t a “scene” or a “moment.” It’s the backbone. If you know what someone wants, you know what they’re going to run into. Without something in the way, there’s no story—only a wish list. But with conflict, you get drama, energy, transformation, and the pain (or thrill) that makes it all real.

The Deep Dive: What Makes Conflict
Conflict isn’t just fighting. It’s not only good vs. evil or hero vs. villain. Real conflict is layered, complicated, and alive in every corner of story. There are four classic sources:

Character vs. Character: Two people want different things, and there’s not enough for both. (Harry vs. Voldemort, Katniss vs. The Capitol, Marge Gunderson vs. the killer.)

Character vs. Society: One person against the crowd, the system, the expectation. (Erin Brockovich vs. corporate power, Jo March vs. gender roles, Shrek vs. the world.)

Character vs. Nature/World: The world itself is the problem—survival, disaster, disease, fate. (Mark Watney in The Martian, the shark in Jaws, nature in The Revenant.)

Character vs. Self: The deepest, rawest, often most relatable. Fear, addiction, shame, trauma, contradiction. (BoJack Horseman, Fleabag, Elsa in Frozen, Hamlet.)

But most stories braid these together—external battles feeding inner ones, and vice versa. Conflict is the friction between desire and what blocks it, but also the friction inside the person—the parts that fight, deny, or sabotage.

Sometimes conflict is loud: a showdown, a betrayal, a fight. Sometimes it’s silent: a lie, a stare, a secret kept for years. Sometimes it’s both at once. But it always, always matters.

Why Conflict Matters
Without conflict, you have a list of things that happened, not a story. Conflict is what gives events weight—what makes a win feel like relief or triumph, what makes a loss hurt, what makes a choice matter. It’s how you keep the reader hooked, scene by scene, paragraph by paragraph.

Conflict is also what reveals character. When someone is pushed, you see what’s real—what they’ll fight for, what they’ll let go, what lines they’ll cross or hold. It exposes motive, fear, loyalty, secret hunger, true weakness. The person who smiles until someone challenges them, the friend who disappears when shit gets hard, the villain who folds when shown kindness—all revealed by conflict.

Conflict creates stakes. If nothing stands in the way, then nothing is at risk. Conflict says: this costs something. You could lose. You might get hurt. You might have to change, or admit you were wrong, or destroy something you love to get what you want.

Without conflict, readers and viewers drift. They sense nothing can go wrong. They stop caring, because the outcome is never in doubt, and the struggle is never real. With conflict, everything’s alive.

Why Most Stories Fail Without It
You know the feeling: you’re reading or watching and everything just slides by. The prose might be pretty. The characters might be quirky. But nothing hooks you, because nothing is being tested. Maybe there’s a goal, but no real obstacle—just a series of events. Maybe the “conflict” is an afterthought, or never actually threatens the main want. You close the book, leave the theater, turn off the show, and forget it ever existed.

Stories fall flat when conflict is too soft, too distant, too easy to overcome, or when it never evolves. If a character wants something and always gets it, or if the world never says “no,” you don’t have a story—you have a wish-fulfillment fantasy. And unless it’s yours, you probably don’t care.

Conflict also fails when it’s just noise—fights for no reason, drama that doesn’t come from what people actually want or fear. Real conflict is specific. It’s about this character, this moment, this risk. If conflict feels tacked on, mechanical, or disconnected from the heart of the story, the whole thing collapses.

How Conflict Is Often Misunderstood
A lot of writers think conflict means “make characters yell at each other.” Or “add a villain.” Or “put in a big set-piece.” But that’s surface. Conflict isn’t just opposition for opposition’s sake. It’s about the collision of genuine wants, needs, values, or fears. Sometimes it’s quiet. Sometimes it’s brutal. Sometimes the best conflict is inside one person—wanting and not wanting, loving and resenting at the same time.

Some writers dodge conflict because it feels artificial, or “mean,” or they don’t want their characters to suffer. But a story where nothing is risked, nothing is lost, and nothing hurts is a story that never moves. Conflict is the place where you show what matters—where the mask cracks, where the person is revealed.

Other writers mistake conflict for plot twists. They add surprises but forget to make the struggle meaningful. Conflict is about the meaning of struggle, not just the existence of it.

Conflict is not an interruption—it’s the pulse.

How Conflict Powers Everything
Desire: Without resistance, want is easy. With conflict, want gets tested, twisted, sharpened.

Theme: What your character fights for (or gives up) shows what the story really means.

Plot: Every turn, every setback, every reversal is a new collision of want and obstacle.

Scene: Every scene has a power dynamic—a negotiation, a risk, a test.

Voice: Conflict gives the writing edge, urgency, rhythm, and truth.

Conflict is why anything in a story feels real.

The Many Faces of Conflict
Conflict isn’t just “I want X, you want Y.” It’s:

Competing desires in the same person (love vs. duty, hope vs. fear).

Silent sabotage—characters who undermine themselves or others out of jealousy, shame, or panic.

Comedy born of misunderstanding or misalignment (The Office, Schitt’s Creek, Brooklyn Nine-Nine).

Tragedy from the world being what it is (12 Years a Slave, Brokeback Mountain).

The war between truth and lie (Breaking Bad, Succession, Game of Thrones).

The mess of family, friendship, romance, loyalty, betrayal, regret.

Conflict is everywhere: in the rules, the weather, the past, the body, the mind. Every story you love is built on layers of it.

The Writer’s Job
Your job is not to avoid conflict, but to lean into it. Make it real, make it hurt, make it mean something. If it’s hidden, show the cracks. If it’s obvious, raise the stakes. Track how it changes. If you know what every character wants—and what’s in the way, outside and inside—you’ll never run out of scenes, never run out of risk.

Push your characters to the wall. Don’t rescue them too soon. The reader is there for the fight.


You Know What It’s Like to Face Conflict
Let’s cut through the noise: you already understand conflict because you’ve survived it—hell, you’re probably living it right now. You know what it’s like to want something and run face-first into a wall. Maybe you’ve fought with family, lost friends, been boxed in by the system, or spent years wrestling with your own mind. You’ve held back words you wanted to say, burned bridges you wish you hadn’t, lied to protect yourself, or risked everything for something you needed. Maybe you’ve been the villain in someone else’s story, or found out too late that you were fighting yourself the whole time.

You don’t need to be taught what conflict feels like. You know what it is to want, and to be stopped. You know what it’s like to have two impossible choices, to bite your tongue, to slam a door, to wish the world were different. You’ve hurt people and been hurt, picked fights and tried to avoid them, lost battles no one else even saw. Conflict is the air you breathe as a human being; it’s the reason you get out of bed, the reason you lie awake at night, the reason you keep showing up for life even when it’s brutal.

Every time you write, you’re writing your own wars. The stories that matter—the ones that stick—are built from the friction in your own life. You don’t have to fake it or manufacture drama: you just have to be honest. Whether you’re blowing up cities or writing two people staring each other down across a table, it’s all the same. Conflict is the crackle of living. You get it. You’ve lived it. That’s why you can write it.

Every story you create is about someone colliding with the world, with someone else, or with themselves—sometimes all at once. Your job isn’t to invent conflict, it’s to recognize it and let it burn on the page.

How to Spot Conflict in the Wild
1. They SAY What the Problem Is

Sometimes, conflict walks right up and tells you its name. A character (or narrator) lays it out—what’s wrong, who’s in the way, what hurts, what’s broken, what they’re fighting for or against. This is the surface-level, no-bullshit version: the obstacle or opposition is spoken out loud, written into the dialogue, or even thrown in the reader’s face through narration. No subtext, no puzzle—just the problem, announced for all to see. You don’t have to guess where the tension is coming from; they hand it to you.

What Does It Look Like?
It could be an argument where someone shouts, “You’re always trying to control me!” It might be a whispered confession (“I’m scared I’ll never be good enough”), or a battle speech (“We will not go quietly into the night!”). Sometimes it’s a complaint, sometimes a threat, sometimes a desperate plea. Maybe it’s someone admitting they hate their job, love the wrong person, or can’t stand the person next to them. When conflict is spoken, the air shifts—everyone knows what’s at stake, what the fight is, what has to be faced.

Why Writers Use It
Letting a character say what the conflict is does a couple of things. First, it makes the stakes crystal clear for the audience—no guessing games, no ambiguity. You know who’s on what side, what the stakes are, and why everything matters. Spoken conflict draws a line in the sand. It raises the heat instantly because you know a confrontation is coming (or already here). Sometimes, having the characters admit what the fight is about forces everyone—including the audience—to stop pretending and actually deal with the mess.

What to Listen For
Direct accusations: “You lied to me.” / “This is all your fault.”

Ultimatums: “If you walk out that door, don’t come back.”

Stated fears: “I’m afraid you don’t love me anymore.”

Declarations of war: “I won’t let you win.” / “Over my dead body.”

Vulnerable admissions: “I can’t keep pretending everything’s okay.”

Announced rivalries: “I’ve always wanted to beat you.”

Simple, honest confession: “We can’t go on like this.”

Why It Matters
Spoken conflict gives you a spotlight. You know exactly what the story is wrestling with—no hidden agendas (yet). Every action, every bit of tension, every side-eye or slammed door can be traced back to this moment. The plot now has direction: you know what’s at risk, who’s got something to lose, and who’s in the way. It makes characters vulnerable, too. Saying “this is what’s wrong” is a risk; it opens the door to being hurt, challenged, or changed. The fallout is instant—once you say the fight out loud, there’s no stuffing it back in the box.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

The Lord of the Rings — Frodo to Sam: “I can’t do this, Sam.” (Says the conflict—overwhelmed, at the edge, naming the struggle directly.)

Breaking Bad — Skyler to Walt: “I’m afraid of you.” (No more pretending; the fear is the conflict.)

Frozen — Elsa: “You can’t marry a man you just met!” (Calling out the real tension, refusing to play along.)

The Hunger Games — Katniss: “If we burn, you burn with us!” (Declares open war, shifts the power.)

The Office — Jim to Michael: “You’re not my friend. You’re my boss.” (Honest conflict in the open, breaking all the subtext.)

Game of Thrones — Cersei: “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.” (Announces the whole show’s conflict in a single line.)

Spider-Man 2 — Peter Parker to Aunt May: “I’m Spider-Man. No more secrets.” (The conflict between truth and safety is spoken.)

Fleabag — Priest to Fleabag: “Why do you keep using sex to avoid real intimacy?” (Names the root conflict, making the next move unavoidable.)

Star Wars — Luke to Vader: “I’ll never join you!” (Clear, stated opposition.)

Succession — Kendall Roy: “I’m better than you.” (Every episode is built on saying the quiet part loud.)

How It Changes the Story
When the conflict is out in the open, the tension gets teeth. Everyone in the story (and the reader) knows the real terms. There’s no more playing nice. The path ahead is all about dealing with this declared war, hurt, or challenge. Sometimes, the moment a conflict is spoken is the moment everything else becomes possible—resolution, escalation, collapse.

Characters who say what the problem is can’t hide behind jokes or politeness anymore. They risk real change. The air is charged, and the fallout can be huge: relationships break, alliances shift, the truth is unavoidable.

For Writers
Don’t be afraid to let your characters name the fight. Let them say what hurts, what scares them, what they want to destroy or protect. Direct conflict doesn’t make a story less deep—it makes it urgent and honest. And the sooner you get it out there, the sooner you can let the real chaos begin.


How to Spot Conflict in the Wild
2. They SHOW What the Problem Is

Conflict doesn’t have to be shouted or spelled out. Most of the time, you’ll see it: in what characters do, what they refuse to do, the boundaries they set, the lines they cross, the ways they grind against each other (or the world). Sometimes no one ever says what’s wrong, but the actions—the friction, avoidance, sabotage, open defiance—shout it at full volume. The war is in the way they move, the choices they make, the trouble they invite or run from. Conflict leaks out, leaks in, changes the air around every character.

What Does It Look Like?
You spot it in their reactions—tense shoulders, storming out, slamming doors, silent treatments, sharp glances. Conflict is in the patterns: two people who always argue, a hero who can’t stop breaking rules, a family who only shows up at holidays to fight about the past. It’s what people won’t do—refusing to apologize, refusing to ask for help, refusing to show up. Sometimes it’s in the sabotage: a character undermines their own success, burns bridges, pushes people away before they can be left. Maybe someone picks a fight just to feel alive. Maybe a group closes ranks when an outsider appears. The fight is everywhere except the dialogue.

Why Writers Use It
Showing conflict, rather than saying it, pulls the reader into the world—no spoon-feeding, no neon signs, just tension you feel. The story gains depth and danger because the reader gets to piece it together, tracking the patterns, watching the fallout, knowing something’s going to break. This is where stories breathe: in what’s not said but what can’t be avoided. Showing conflict lets you layer subtext, complexity, and makes the audience do a little detective work (which is always more satisfying).

What to Watch For
Patterned resistance: Characters always saying no, dragging their feet, making everything harder than it needs to be.

Silent stand-offs: Tense meals, awkward car rides, long pauses.

Sabotage: Doing things that make the problem worse, even (especially) when it doesn’t make sense.

Repeated arguments: Fighting about little things when the big problem is left unsaid.

Physical actions: Slamming doors, walking away, breaking something valuable, refusing to leave or refusing to stay.

Third-party conflict: Using someone else to fight your battles—gossip, triangulation, picking sides.

Risky choices: Going behind someone’s back, defying orders, making bold moves that provoke opposition.

Small rebellions: Not answering calls, “forgetting” an important date, doing something out of spite or self-defense.

Why It Matters
Conflict shown through action is what makes a story feel real, alive, and full of stakes. You don’t need a speech to sense the heat in the room. Readers get to participate, connecting the dots, reading the air. This is how real life works: most fights aren’t announced, they’re acted out, lived through, felt in the gut. When a character shows their struggle, you can’t look away—you want to know what’s really going on, what the next explosion will be, whether anyone will make it out clean.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

Fargo — Jerry and his wife: Every scene is tense, even when nobody’s yelling. Jerry’s secrets show up in his lies, awkwardness, and desperation.

The Godfather — Michael Corleone: His choices—who he protects, who he hurts, who he refuses to become—show his conflict with his family and himself.

Mad Men — Don Draper: His constant cheating, working late, and avoiding honest conversations show an endless, internal war.

The Office — Angela and Dwight: Their secret, on-again-off-again relationship is a war of gestures, furtive glances, petty sabotage.

Fleabag: The protagonist’s actions—sabotaging relationships, chasing chaos—constantly show her inner turmoil, without needing to spell it out.

Black Panther — T’Challa and Killmonger: Most of their conflict is in what they do—choosing sides, making risky moves, breaking tradition.

Get Out — Chris: The tension is all in the way people act around him—too nice, too invasive, too interested.

The Simpsons — Bart vs. Lisa: Their fights are more about pranks, sabotage, and silent wars than about what’s actually said.

BoJack Horseman: Characters hurt each other through neglect, self-destruction, and distance.

Euphoria — Rue and Jules: They never really say what’s wrong, but their decisions—staying, leaving, running, chasing—show all the fractures.

The Crown: Every episode is a masterclass in people refusing to say what’s wrong but living out the conflict anyway—through cold shoulders, missed events, or passive-aggressive tradition.

How It Changes the Story
When conflict is shown, not told, the story fills with suspense and subtext. You don’t have the answers, but you know something’s coming. It’s more satisfying for the reader—they get to watch the storm build, feel the pressure rise, and wonder when (or if) anyone will finally snap. Sometimes this keeps the story simmering for ages; sometimes the slow-burn is the point. When someone finally says what the problem is, it lands with ten times the force, because you’ve felt it all along.

For Writers
Let your characters act out the fight. Make them sabotage their own happiness, push away the people they love, pick fights with the world or themselves. Show the grind, the friction, the tiny rebellions and epic disasters. The best stories are built on what’s acted, not announced. If you can make the reader sense the conflict without a single speech, you’re halfway to a story that lives.


How to Spot Conflict in the Wild
3. They HIDE What the Problem Is

Not all conflict comes out swinging. Sometimes it’s buried—denied, camouflaged, or kept under lock and key. This is the sneakiest, most human kind of conflict: knowing there’s a problem, but doing anything not to face it, not to let anyone else see it, maybe not even letting yourself know it’s there. The result? A story full of tension, odd silences, weird detours, and pressure that never quite releases. Hidden conflict is where real drama cooks.

What Does It Look Like?
Hidden conflict lurks in the gaps—awkward pauses, the joke that lands flat, the way two people never quite look each other in the eye. You see it in characters who dodge questions, change the subject, over-explain simple things, or go out of their way to avoid someone. Maybe they attack a “safe” target instead of the real one, or lose their shit over nothing because they can’t name what’s really wrong. Sometimes they drown in distractions—work, habits, helping others, busy-ness—to keep from thinking about the problem. Maybe they start a pointless argument just to avoid the one that matters.

This is the fight that happens under the fight. No one ever says what the real issue is, but everyone feels it—the tension, the stakes, the threat that something could snap at any second.

Why Writers Use It
Hidden conflict is a goldmine for tension and realism. Real people rarely name their fights outright, especially the big, scary ones. We hide, we deflect, we use humor, we get mean, we sabotage, we freeze. Burying the fight keeps the story humming with subtext, suspense, and surprise—it forces the audience to read between the lines, wonder when the dam will break, and stay tuned for the truth underneath all the noise.

What to Watch For
Avoidance: Characters dodge each other, skip events, or change the subject whenever the real issue comes up.

Deflection: Picking smaller, unrelated fights. (“Why are you always late?” instead of “I’m scared you’ll leave me.”)

Overcompensation: Acting too nice, too cold, too busy, too perfect to cover up the mess.

Distraction: Pouring energy into work, hobbies, caretaking—anything to keep from facing the conflict.

Passive aggression: Snide remarks, the silent treatment, doing what’s asked—but badly.

Guilt trips: Making someone else feel bad so you don’t have to talk about what’s actually wrong.

Self-sabotage: Messing things up “by accident” so the conflict never comes to a head.

Breaking routines: Sudden changes—someone stops calling, skips dinner, starts new habits overnight.

Why It Matters
Hidden conflict is where stories get real, complicated, and dangerous. It’s not just what’s said, but what’s left unsaid that twists a relationship, keeps a family at war, or turns a workplace toxic. Every scene gets a charge, because everyone is on edge, waiting for the unspoken bomb to go off. The longer the fight stays hidden, the more power it has—when it finally breaks loose, the results are explosive, heartbreaking, or cathartic as hell.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

The Sopranos — Tony and Carmela: Their fights are rarely about what’s on the surface—most arguments are stand-ins for deeper betrayal, resentment, and loneliness.

Breaking Bad — Walt and Skyler: They dance around the truth for seasons—avoiding, lying, distracting, pretending nothing’s wrong even as everything falls apart.

Succession: Every character’s real fight is buried under sarcasm, jokes, and business talk; nobody says what they mean, but you can cut the tension with a knife.

The Royal Tenenbaums: The family’s weirdness, silence, and sabotage all mask a deep, shared wound nobody will name.

The Great Gatsby: The parties and drama are distractions; the real conflict—class, love, loss—simmers beneath the surface.

Lady Bird: The fights between Lady Bird and her mom are full of jokes, avoidance, and sudden blow-ups—never directly about the real pain underneath.

Ted Lasso (Rebecca and her ex-husband): She hides her anger and heartbreak behind professionalism and little power moves.

The West Wing — CJ and her dad: The conflict isn’t named—it’s all in what isn’t said, what’s avoided, and the rituals they use to cope.

Moonlight: Chiron rarely speaks about what’s hurting him, but every scene shows what he’s running from.

How It Changes the Story
Hidden conflict is a pressure cooker. The story builds and builds, simmering with scenes where nothing seems to happen—except for everything underneath. When the truth finally comes out, everything changes: relationships break, heal, or transform. Even if it never surfaces, that unresolved tension shapes every moment, every choice, every regret.

For Writers
Write the silence. Build scenes where the real fight is always lurking just outside the frame. Let your characters distract, joke, freeze, lash out, retreat—anything but say what’s really going on. The more your story lives in the unsaid, the more it feels like real life. And when the truth finally cracks through, let it break something open.


Potency Levels: Low — The Gentle Strain
What Low Potency Conflict Is
Low-potency conflict is the quiet tension that simmers beneath the surface. It’s not a fight, not a crisis—more like a pressure in the air, a vague sense that something’s off, or an unspoken difference that keeps people from fully connecting. Maybe it’s a disagreement left unaddressed, a feeling of not quite fitting in, or a clash of values that never erupts into argument. Most of the time, neither side would call it a conflict at all. It’s the weight of politeness, the itch of unsaid things, the hesitation before reaching out.

In low-potency mode, conflict doesn’t drive the plot forward—it colors the emotional world. It creates layers, moods, a hint of friction or melancholy, a subtle sense of distance between people. It isn’t nothing; it’s the thread that might snap, the question that might get asked, the silence before the storm.

How It Shows Up in Characters
Awkward silences: Conversations stall or shift topic just before things get real.

Subtle avoidance: Characters keep busy, dodge each other, or let messages go unanswered.

Microaggressions: Small jabs, jokes, or passive comments hint at underlying issues.

Walking on eggshells: Characters act extra careful, checking themselves before they speak.

Minor irritations: Sighing, eye-rolling, snark, or gentle teasing that never turns mean.

Withdrawal: Someone pulls back—physically or emotionally—without explanation.

Routine over truth: The familiar is chosen over the honest, keeping everything running smoothly but a little off.

Story Effects of Low-Potency Conflict
Sets a Mood: The story feels a little tense, uncertain, or bittersweet. Readers sense something unresolved, even when everyone acts “fine.”

Builds Relatability: It’s real—most of life is this, not screaming matches. We all know what it’s like to keep the peace while something festers.

Foreshadows Trouble or Change: This is often the canary in the coal mine. That subtle strain hints at bigger conflicts that could break through if the right pressure hits.

Deepens Character: People with quiet struggles feel more honest. They aren’t just bouncing off plot points; their inner world matters. Their caution or frustration, even if muted, makes them more believable.

What It Feels Like to Write
You linger: Scenes last a little longer, with pauses and unsaid things hanging in the air.

Dialogue skirts the issue: People hint, joke, or sidestep the real subject.

Action is small-scale: Nobody flips a table—they just forget a birthday, or stand at the edge of a group.

Pacing is gentle: There’s room to breathe, to notice how a glance or sigh changes everything.

Pop Culture Examples
Pam Beesly (The Office):
Her engagement to Roy is all low-grade conflict—quiet disappointment, unspoken doubts, halfhearted plans. Most of it shows up in silence, stolen glances, and what she doesn’t say.

Charlotte (Lost in Translation):
Her marriage feels strained, but there are almost no fights—just silences, distant phone calls, and missed connections. The conflict is all subtext.

The sisters and their father navigate worry and longing with only minor flare-ups—the real strain is in missing their mother and trying to stay upbeat.

Jim Hopper (Stranger Things, early episodes):
His frustration with the town and his own grief comes out as mild irritation and avoidance, never open anger—at first.

Gilmore Girls (Lorelai and her parents):
Most conflict is low-key—awkward dinners, comments left hanging, politeness barely masking deep difference.

Kiki (Kiki’s Delivery Service):
Kiki feels out of place in her new town. The conflict is all internal—doubt, loneliness, the quiet push to belong.

Steven (Steven Universe, early on):
He senses the Gems are hiding things, but his struggle is gentle—hints, questions, soft tensions as he tries to find his place.

When to Use Low Potency as a Writer
When you want to build atmosphere and intimacy before things boil over.

When your story is about relationships, coming-of-age, or the day-to-day struggles that shape people.

When you want to show how conflict isn’t always loud—sometimes it’s the quiet strain that changes everything.

When the story is about restraint, not eruption; about holding it together, not breaking apart.

What Keeps Conflict Low?
Fear: Rocking the boat might cost too much.

Politeness: People don’t want to hurt each other, so they hold back.

Habit: They’re used to avoiding problems.

Denial: If you don’t talk about it, maybe it’ll go away.

Complacency: “Good enough” feels safer than being honest.

How Low Conflict Can Change
A new pressure—a guest, a secret, a mistake—can raise the stakes from gentle strain to open confrontation.

Sometimes it stays low, and the story becomes about living with tension, letting go, or finding quiet acceptance.

Sometimes, just one honest conversation is enough to change everything.

Low conflict is the heartbeat under the words.
Write it with nuance, patience, and respect for the ways people tiptoe around each other.
Let it simmer.
It’s how most stories start.

## Potency Levels: Medium — The Friction Point

### What Medium Potency Conflict Is

Medium-potency conflict is where friction turns into force. This isn’t a quiet strain or a background vibe—this is conflict stepping into the light. Now, something real stands in the way. The characters start pushing back, lines are drawn, and choices have consequences. This is where arguments happen, alliances shift, and risks are taken. It’s not all-out war, but nobody’s coasting anymore.

Medium conflict is about movement and escalation: not explosive, but undeniable. The air crackles. Every decision risks a reaction, every word might tip the balance. This is the story’s heartbeat getting faster—the middle act, where things get complicated and messy.

---

### How It Shows Up in Characters

* **Direct Confrontations:** Arguments, debates, pointed questions. People call each other out, challenge assumptions, or refuse to back down.
* **Taking Sides:** Characters start forming teams, building alliances, or drawing battle lines—sometimes openly, sometimes in secret.
* **Escalating Stakes:** Actions have visible consequences. The stakes go from “might be awkward” to “something could break.”
* **Active Avoidance:** Dodging someone, ghosting, or passive-aggressive behavior—there’s real energy behind not dealing with the problem.
* **Testing Boundaries:** Characters push rules, question authority, or take calculated risks.
* **Negotiation:** Compromise, bargaining, or manipulation—people try to get what they want, but now it costs something.

---

### Story Effects of Medium-Potency Conflict

**Builds Momentum:** Conflict now drives the story forward, not just flavoring it. Every clash changes something.

**Reveals Character:** You see what people will risk or fight for, and how they handle pressure.

**Heats Up Relationships:** Tension simmers—friendships strain, romances spark or fizzle, enemies become personal.

**Sharpens Stakes:** The reader feels what’s at risk, and that losing matters.

**Links Events:** Scenes connect—one fight leads to another, consequences stack up, and plotlines intertwine.

---

### What It Feels Like to Write

* **Scenes Snap:** Dialogue is sharper, actions are bolder. There’s more energy—less coasting, more conflict.
* **Emotional Peaks:** Hope, fear, anger, relief. You get to play with the full range of emotion as people bump up against each other.
* **Chain Reaction:** Choices have ripple effects. The outcome of one scene pushes the next.
* **Real Fallout:** No more “safe” space—someone is hurt, insulted, inspired, or changed by what happens.

---

### Pop Culture Examples

**Jim Halpert vs. Dwight Schrute (The Office):**
Their rivalry moves from low-key pranks to confrontations, sabotage, and loyalty tests. Every season, the stakes get higher.

**Hermione, Ron, and Harry (Harry Potter):**
Their friendship is tested by jealousy, misunderstandings, and differing priorities—especially in the later books.

**Katniss and Peeta (The Hunger Games):**
Alliances and betrayals become real, survival depends on choices, and even love gets weaponized.

**Troy and Gabriella (High School Musical 2):**
Conflicts between friendship, ambition, and romance heat up. Choices have consequences, and loyalties are tested.

**Moana vs. Her Father (Moana):**
Their conflict moves from “don’t go past the reef” to open argument and finally, defiance and change.

**Peter Parker (Spider-Man):**
He clashes with friends, mentors, and villains—juggling loyalty, secrecy, and the urge to do good.

**The Breakfast Club:**
Medium conflict is everywhere—misunderstandings, open arguments, and shifting alliances drive every scene.

---

### When to Use Medium Potency as a Writer

* When you want the story to build heat and speed—no more drifting.
* When relationships need to be tested, bent, or redefined.
* When you want characters to be brave, messy, or reveal what matters most.
* When the plot needs a reason to keep moving—characters push, and the world pushes back.

---

### What Keeps Conflict at Medium?

* **Doubt:** No one’s sure they’re right, or if the fight is worth it.
* **Fear of Going Too Far:** People risk hurt but aren’t ready to burn it all down.
* **Social Pressure:** There’s pushback, but not open rebellion—yet.
* **Mixed Feelings:** Wanting two things at once, torn loyalties.
* **Uncertainty:** Stakes are high, but consequences aren’t catastrophic…yet.

---

### How Medium Conflict Can Change

A spark—a betrayal, disaster, or victory—can ramp conflict up to high.
If characters retreat or back down, tension can slide back to low.

Sometimes the story is about escalation, sometimes it’s about learning to pull back before everything breaks.

Medium conflict is the heat before the boil.
Write it with energy, honesty, and an eye for the ways people collide.
Let it breathe, but don’t let it stall.
It’s the engine that keeps the story burning.

Here’s the parallel entry for **High Potency Conflict: The All-Out War**—matching your word count, depth, and vibe.

---

## Potency Levels: High — The All-Out War

### What High Potency Conflict Is

High-potency conflict is chaos unleashed—a clash so intense it takes over everything. There’s no “side plot,” no safe ground, no neutral party. The lines are drawn, the bridges are burned, and what’s at stake is nothing less than everything: loyalty, identity, love, survival, maybe even the world itself. High conflict rewrites the rules, upends every relationship, and forces characters into corners. If medium conflict is a bonfire, high is a wildfire—consuming, transforming, leaving nothing untouched.

This is the level where people fight to win or to destroy, not just to be right. Motives are naked, power dynamics shift with every move, and consequences are huge and permanent. Someone’s going down. The story can’t help but race to the climax.

---

### How It Shows Up in Characters

* **Open War:** Characters take bold, irreversible actions—betrayals, ultimatums, violence, declarations of love or hate.
* **Total Sacrifice:** Nothing is held back. Reputations, relationships, and even lives are risked or lost in the struggle.
* **Personal Meltdown:** People unravel—breakdowns, confessions, rage, and regret spill out in raw, public moments.
* **Black-and-White Thinking:** All nuance is gone. It’s us vs. them, right vs. wrong, now or never.
* **Desperation Moves:** Last-ditch efforts, wild gambles, big reveals. People will do anything to win—or to stop the other side.
* **Collateral Damage:** Innocent bystanders, entire systems, or worlds get caught in the crossfire.

---

### Story Effects of High-Potency Conflict

**Explosive Plot:** Every scene is dialed up. Cliffhangers, reversals, big showdowns—there’s no downtime.

**Irreversible Consequences:** When it’s over, nothing is the same. Losses are real, victories are costly, and scars don’t fade.

**Moral Blur:** Heroes make villain moves, villains get their humanity, and lines between right and wrong get smeared.

**Audience Hooked:** Stakes are so high, the reader has to see how it ends—even if it hurts.

**Everything Breaks:** Relationships fracture, families implode, systems collapse. This is the point of no return.

---

### What It Feels Like to Write

* **Every Scene Is a Climax:** No filler, no filler—just wave after wave of escalation.
* **Dialogue Burns:** Shouts, breakdowns, confessions, lies and truths that cut deep. Nobody’s polite.
* **Characters Snap:** They betray, confess, or finally say the thing they’ve buried for years.
* **Scenes Are Unstable:** The story shakes—anyone can turn, anything can happen.

---

### Pop Culture Examples

**Breaking Bad (Walter vs. Jesse, final season):**
All loyalty is shattered, violence erupts, and the only way out is total destruction.

**Avengers: Infinity War & Endgame:**
Friendships, lives, and even the universe itself are on the line. Alliances break, heroes fall, and nobody walks away unchanged.

**Macbeth (Shakespeare):**
Bloodshed, paranoia, madness. Everyone is either a casualty or a conspirator by the end.

**Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (Obi-Wan vs. Anakin):**
Mentor and student become mortal enemies—love turns to hatred, the world splits in two.

**Game of Thrones (Red Wedding, Battle for King’s Landing):**
Every grudge, alliance, and secret explodes. Nobody is safe; nothing is sacred.

**The Godfather, Part II:**
Michael’s war with his enemies (and his own family) leaves him alone—he wins, but loses his soul.

**Hamilton (Burr vs. Hamilton):**
Rivalry, ambition, and personal grievances erupt in a duel that ends one life and breaks another.

**Scarface (final act):**
Tony Montana destroys everything around him in his quest for power—he can’t stop until it’s all gone.

---

### When to Use High Potency as a Writer

* For finales, breaking points, and revolutions.
* When you want the story to be unforgettable—even if it hurts.
* When you want to see what happens when people can’t walk away.
* For stories about obsession, downfall, or impossible stakes.

---

### What Pushes Conflict to High?

* **Betrayal:** Trust shatters, and there’s no turning back.
* **Desperation:** It’s win or die—characters have nothing left to lose.
* **Ultimate Threat:** Something too precious to risk is threatened.
* **Escalation:** Every attempt to fix things just makes it worse.
* **Truth Exposed:** Secrets come out, forcing confrontation at any cost.

---

### How High Conflict Can Change

* Someone wins, but the victory is pyrrhic—what’s left is ash.
* The conflict ends in loss, death, or exile, and survivors must rebuild.
* Rarely, someone finds grace or a new beginning—but only after everything else is gone.

High conflict is nuclear.
Use it when you want to test what’s left standing after the storm.
Let it rip. Let it hurt.
See what breaks, and what (or who) survives the fire.

**Tools for Actively Controlling Potency Levels: Quick Reference**

---

### 1. Escalation and De-escalation

* **Raise Potency:**
  Drop a bomb in their path—a deadline, new rival, higher stakes, or unexpected twist. Force a choice with real cost.
  *Ex:* Pam’s engagement in *The Office* suddenly spikes Jim’s passive longing into bold, risky action.

* **Lower Potency:**
  Offer escape routes—distractions, comfort, disappointments, or a reason to let go. Let the world cool things down.
  *Ex:* After a big heartbreak, your character checks out, tells themselves they never really cared.

---

### 2. Change the Stakes

* **Bigger Consequences = Higher Potency**
  Wanting coffee? Low. Wanting to save a life? High.
  As the risk or reward grows, so does the need.

---

### 3. Play With Resistance

* **More Resistance:**
  Block the path. Add conflict, rivals, rules, guilt, or fear.
  Want + Friction = Heat.

* **Less Resistance:**
  Remove obstacles, make the want easy—desire cools, maybe fades out.
  No friction = no story.

---

### 4. Expose or Conceal the Want

* **Expose:**
  Desire goes public—now it’s risky, vulnerable, volatile.
  *Ex:* Secret crush becomes public confession.

* **Conceal:**
  If the want stays private, it simmers—unless the world turns up the heat.

---

### 5. Mix Internal and External Pressures

* Let the inside and outside worlds collide. Maybe your character is chill… until someone else wants the same thing, or threatens to take it away. Sparks fly.

---

### 6. Let Desire Shift Over Time

* **Potency is a spectrum:**
  Quiet want at first, tension builds, crisis hits—desire peaks.
  Show how setbacks, failures, and victories change the temperature.

---

### 7. Use Symbolic Objects/Actions

* Small gesture = small want (holding a letter, scrolling a feed).
  Big gesture = big want (sending the letter, storming a stage).
  Rituals and objects can “measure” desire on the page.

---

### 8. Physical and Emotional Signals

* **Low:** silence, staring, small talk, drifting.
* **Medium:** risk, confession, argument, visible stress.
* **High:** obsession, meltdown, yelling, ultimatums, burned bridges.

---

### 9. Other Characters Can Turn the Dial

* Allies stoke desire (“Go for it!”), rivals raise the stakes, mentors warn, family guilts.
  Desire always lives in a social ecosystem.

---

**Questions to Ask as You Write:**

* What does my character want—right now?
* How bad is the burn?
* What would push them to act (or to stop)?
* What stands in their way—and does it matter?
* What’s the real cost if they fail?
* If they win, is it enough—or does a new want show up?

---

**Dial Examples:**

* *Low → Medium*: Watching from afar → crush leaves soon, so they make a move.
* *Medium → High*: Wants promotion → rival cheats, so risks it all.
* *High → Low*: Obsessed with revenge → lets go, finds peace (or just collapses).

---

**Bottom line:**
Potency is a dial, not a switch. Scene by scene, you control the heat. If the story stalls, just ask:
**“How badly do they want it—right now? What would turn it up, or cool it down?”**



CONFLICT
What It Is
Conflict is the collision point—where desire meets resistance, where every “I want” runs into a wall. If desire is the fuel, conflict is the spark that turns it volatile. It’s not just two people yelling, or an explosion in the third act. Conflict is everything that stops a character from getting what they want: the world, other people, themselves, or just plain bad luck. Strip away the trappings, and story is want vs. obstacle, hope vs. reality, need vs. limit. It can be violent or invisible. It can be a world war or the tension in a single look. But without conflict, there’s no movement, no change, no stakes—just a flatline.

At its core, conflict is friction. It’s a locked door, a closed heart, a harsh truth, an impossible choice. It’s the uncomfortable place where your character is forced to either push, break, adapt, or collapse. Sometimes conflict is external—a villain, a rival, a society that says “no.” Sometimes it’s internal—fear, guilt, shame, contradiction, memory. Most of the time, it’s both at once, grinding against each other, pushing the story forward.

Conflict isn’t a “scene” or a “moment.” It’s the backbone. If you know what someone wants, you know what they’re going to run into. Without something in the way, there’s no story—only a wish list. But with conflict, you get drama, energy, transformation, and the pain (or thrill) that makes it all real.

The Deep Dive: What Makes Conflict
Conflict isn’t just fighting. It’s not only good vs. evil or hero vs. villain. Real conflict is layered, complicated, and alive in every corner of story. There are four classic sources:

Character vs. Character: Two people want different things, and there’s not enough for both. (Harry vs. Voldemort, Katniss vs. The Capitol, Marge Gunderson vs. the killer.)

Character vs. Society: One person against the crowd, the system, the expectation. (Erin Brockovich vs. corporate power, Jo March vs. gender roles, Shrek vs. the world.)

Character vs. Nature/World: The world itself is the problem—survival, disaster, disease, fate. (Mark Watney in The Martian, the shark in Jaws, nature in The Revenant.)

Character vs. Self: The deepest, rawest, often most relatable. Fear, addiction, shame, trauma, contradiction. (BoJack Horseman, Fleabag, Elsa in Frozen, Hamlet.)

But most stories braid these together—external battles feeding inner ones, and vice versa. Conflict is the friction between desire and what blocks it, but also the friction inside the person—the parts that fight, deny, or sabotage.

Sometimes conflict is loud: a showdown, a betrayal, a fight. Sometimes it’s silent: a lie, a stare, a secret kept for years. Sometimes it’s both at once. But it always, always matters.

Why Conflict Matters
Without conflict, you have a list of things that happened, not a story. Conflict is what gives events weight—what makes a win feel like relief or triumph, what makes a loss hurt, what makes a choice matter. It’s how you keep the reader hooked, scene by scene, paragraph by paragraph.

Conflict is also what reveals character. When someone is pushed, you see what’s real—what they’ll fight for, what they’ll let go, what lines they’ll cross or hold. It exposes motive, fear, loyalty, secret hunger, true weakness. The person who smiles until someone challenges them, the friend who disappears when shit gets hard, the villain who folds when shown kindness—all revealed by conflict.

Conflict creates stakes. If nothing stands in the way, then nothing is at risk. Conflict says: this costs something. You could lose. You might get hurt. You might have to change, or admit you were wrong, or destroy something you love to get what you want.

Without conflict, readers and viewers drift. They sense nothing can go wrong. They stop caring, because the outcome is never in doubt, and the struggle is never real. With conflict, everything’s alive.

Why Most Stories Fail Without It
You know the feeling: you’re reading or watching and everything just slides by. The prose might be pretty. The characters might be quirky. But nothing hooks you, because nothing is being tested. Maybe there’s a goal, but no real obstacle—just a series of events. Maybe the “conflict” is an afterthought, or never actually threatens the main want. You close the book, leave the theater, turn off the show, and forget it ever existed.

Stories fall flat when conflict is too soft, too distant, too easy to overcome, or when it never evolves. If a character wants something and always gets it, or if the world never says “no,” you don’t have a story—you have a wish-fulfillment fantasy. And unless it’s yours, you probably don’t care.

Conflict also fails when it’s just noise—fights for no reason, drama that doesn’t come from what people actually want or fear. Real conflict is specific. It’s about this character, this moment, this risk. If conflict feels tacked on, mechanical, or disconnected from the heart of the story, the whole thing collapses.

How Conflict Is Often Misunderstood
A lot of writers think conflict means “make characters yell at each other.” Or “add a villain.” Or “put in a big set-piece.” But that’s surface. Conflict isn’t just opposition for opposition’s sake. It’s about the collision of genuine wants, needs, values, or fears. Sometimes it’s quiet. Sometimes it’s brutal. Sometimes the best conflict is inside one person—wanting and not wanting, loving and resenting at the same time.

Some writers dodge conflict because it feels artificial, or “mean,” or they don’t want their characters to suffer. But a story where nothing is risked, nothing is lost, and nothing hurts is a story that never moves. Conflict is the place where you show what matters—where the mask cracks, where the person is revealed.

Other writers mistake conflict for plot twists. They add surprises but forget to make the struggle meaningful. Conflict is about the meaning of struggle, not just the existence of it.

Conflict is not an interruption—it’s the pulse.

How Conflict Powers Everything
Desire: Without resistance, want is easy. With conflict, want gets tested, twisted, sharpened.

Theme: What your character fights for (or gives up) shows what the story really means.

Plot: Every turn, every setback, every reversal is a new collision of want and obstacle.

Scene: Every scene has a power dynamic—a negotiation, a risk, a test.

Voice: Conflict gives the writing edge, urgency, rhythm, and truth.

Conflict is why anything in a story feels real.

The Many Faces of Conflict
Conflict isn’t just “I want X, you want Y.” It’s:

Competing desires in the same person (love vs. duty, hope vs. fear).

Silent sabotage—characters who undermine themselves or others out of jealousy, shame, or panic.

Comedy born of misunderstanding or misalignment (The Office, Schitt’s Creek, Brooklyn Nine-Nine).

Tragedy from the world being what it is (12 Years a Slave, Brokeback Mountain).

The war between truth and lie (Breaking Bad, Succession, Game of Thrones).

The mess of family, friendship, romance, loyalty, betrayal, regret.

Conflict is everywhere: in the rules, the weather, the past, the body, the mind. Every story you love is built on layers of it.

The Writer’s Job
Your job is not to avoid conflict, but to lean into it. Make it real, make it hurt, make it mean something. If it’s hidden, show the cracks. If it’s obvious, raise the stakes. Track how it changes. If you know what every character wants—and what’s in the way, outside and inside—you’ll never run out of scenes, never run out of risk.

Push your characters to the wall. Don’t rescue them too soon. The reader is there for the fight.


You Know What It’s Like to Face Conflict
Let’s cut through the noise: you already understand conflict because you’ve survived it—hell, you’re probably living it right now. You know what it’s like to want something and run face-first into a wall. Maybe you’ve fought with family, lost friends, been boxed in by the system, or spent years wrestling with your own mind. You’ve held back words you wanted to say, burned bridges you wish you hadn’t, lied to protect yourself, or risked everything for something you needed. Maybe you’ve been the villain in someone else’s story, or found out too late that you were fighting yourself the whole time.

You don’t need to be taught what conflict feels like. You know what it is to want, and to be stopped. You know what it’s like to have two impossible choices, to bite your tongue, to slam a door, to wish the world were different. You’ve hurt people and been hurt, picked fights and tried to avoid them, lost battles no one else even saw. Conflict is the air you breathe as a human being; it’s the reason you get out of bed, the reason you lie awake at night, the reason you keep showing up for life even when it’s brutal.

Every time you write, you’re writing your own wars. The stories that matter—the ones that stick—are built from the friction in your own life. You don’t have to fake it or manufacture drama: you just have to be honest. Whether you’re blowing up cities or writing two people staring each other down across a table, it’s all the same. Conflict is the crackle of living. You get it. You’ve lived it. That’s why you can write it.

Every story you create is about someone colliding with the world, with someone else, or with themselves—sometimes all at once. Your job isn’t to invent conflict, it’s to recognize it and let it burn on the page.

How to Spot Conflict in the Wild
1. They SAY What the Problem Is

Sometimes, conflict walks right up and tells you its name. A character (or narrator) lays it out—what’s wrong, who’s in the way, what hurts, what’s broken, what they’re fighting for or against. This is the surface-level, no-bullshit version: the obstacle or opposition is spoken out loud, written into the dialogue, or even thrown in the reader’s face through narration. No subtext, no puzzle—just the problem, announced for all to see. You don’t have to guess where the tension is coming from; they hand it to you.

What Does It Look Like?
It could be an argument where someone shouts, “You’re always trying to control me!” It might be a whispered confession (“I’m scared I’ll never be good enough”), or a battle speech (“We will not go quietly into the night!”). Sometimes it’s a complaint, sometimes a threat, sometimes a desperate plea. Maybe it’s someone admitting they hate their job, love the wrong person, or can’t stand the person next to them. When conflict is spoken, the air shifts—everyone knows what’s at stake, what the fight is, what has to be faced.

Why Writers Use It
Letting a character say what the conflict is does a couple of things. First, it makes the stakes crystal clear for the audience—no guessing games, no ambiguity. You know who’s on what side, what the stakes are, and why everything matters. Spoken conflict draws a line in the sand. It raises the heat instantly because you know a confrontation is coming (or already here). Sometimes, having the characters admit what the fight is about forces everyone—including the audience—to stop pretending and actually deal with the mess.

What to Listen For
Direct accusations: “You lied to me.” / “This is all your fault.”

Ultimatums: “If you walk out that door, don’t come back.”

Stated fears: “I’m afraid you don’t love me anymore.”

Declarations of war: “I won’t let you win.” / “Over my dead body.”

Vulnerable admissions: “I can’t keep pretending everything’s okay.”

Announced rivalries: “I’ve always wanted to beat you.”

Simple, honest confession: “We can’t go on like this.”

Why It Matters
Spoken conflict gives you a spotlight. You know exactly what the story is wrestling with—no hidden agendas (yet). Every action, every bit of tension, every side-eye or slammed door can be traced back to this moment. The plot now has direction: you know what’s at risk, who’s got something to lose, and who’s in the way. It makes characters vulnerable, too. Saying “this is what’s wrong” is a risk; it opens the door to being hurt, challenged, or changed. The fallout is instant—once you say the fight out loud, there’s no stuffing it back in the box.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

The Lord of the Rings — Frodo to Sam: “I can’t do this, Sam.” (Says the conflict—overwhelmed, at the edge, naming the struggle directly.)

Breaking Bad — Skyler to Walt: “I’m afraid of you.” (No more pretending; the fear is the conflict.)

Frozen — Elsa: “You can’t marry a man you just met!” (Calling out the real tension, refusing to play along.)

The Hunger Games — Katniss: “If we burn, you burn with us!” (Declares open war, shifts the power.)

The Office — Jim to Michael: “You’re not my friend. You’re my boss.” (Honest conflict in the open, breaking all the subtext.)

Game of Thrones — Cersei: “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.” (Announces the whole show’s conflict in a single line.)

Spider-Man 2 — Peter Parker to Aunt May: “I’m Spider-Man. No more secrets.” (The conflict between truth and safety is spoken.)

Fleabag — Priest to Fleabag: “Why do you keep using sex to avoid real intimacy?” (Names the root conflict, making the next move unavoidable.)

Star Wars — Luke to Vader: “I’ll never join you!” (Clear, stated opposition.)

Succession — Kendall Roy: “I’m better than you.” (Every episode is built on saying the quiet part loud.)

How It Changes the Story
When the conflict is out in the open, the tension gets teeth. Everyone in the story (and the reader) knows the real terms. There’s no more playing nice. The path ahead is all about dealing with this declared war, hurt, or challenge. Sometimes, the moment a conflict is spoken is the moment everything else becomes possible—resolution, escalation, collapse.

Characters who say what the problem is can’t hide behind jokes or politeness anymore. They risk real change. The air is charged, and the fallout can be huge: relationships break, alliances shift, the truth is unavoidable.

For Writers
Don’t be afraid to let your characters name the fight. Let them say what hurts, what scares them, what they want to destroy or protect. Direct conflict doesn’t make a story less deep—it makes it urgent and honest. And the sooner you get it out there, the sooner you can let the real chaos begin.


How to Spot Conflict in the Wild
2. They SHOW What the Problem Is

Conflict doesn’t have to be shouted or spelled out. Most of the time, you’ll see it: in what characters do, what they refuse to do, the boundaries they set, the lines they cross, the ways they grind against each other (or the world). Sometimes no one ever says what’s wrong, but the actions—the friction, avoidance, sabotage, open defiance—shout it at full volume. The war is in the way they move, the choices they make, the trouble they invite or run from. Conflict leaks out, leaks in, changes the air around every character.

What Does It Look Like?
You spot it in their reactions—tense shoulders, storming out, slamming doors, silent treatments, sharp glances. Conflict is in the patterns: two people who always argue, a hero who can’t stop breaking rules, a family who only shows up at holidays to fight about the past. It’s what people won’t do—refusing to apologize, refusing to ask for help, refusing to show up. Sometimes it’s in the sabotage: a character undermines their own success, burns bridges, pushes people away before they can be left. Maybe someone picks a fight just to feel alive. Maybe a group closes ranks when an outsider appears. The fight is everywhere except the dialogue.

Why Writers Use It
Showing conflict, rather than saying it, pulls the reader into the world—no spoon-feeding, no neon signs, just tension you feel. The story gains depth and danger because the reader gets to piece it together, tracking the patterns, watching the fallout, knowing something’s going to break. This is where stories breathe: in what’s not said but what can’t be avoided. Showing conflict lets you layer subtext, complexity, and makes the audience do a little detective work (which is always more satisfying).

What to Watch For
Patterned resistance: Characters always saying no, dragging their feet, making everything harder than it needs to be.

Silent stand-offs: Tense meals, awkward car rides, long pauses.

Sabotage: Doing things that make the problem worse, even (especially) when it doesn’t make sense.

Repeated arguments: Fighting about little things when the big problem is left unsaid.

Physical actions: Slamming doors, walking away, breaking something valuable, refusing to leave or refusing to stay.

Third-party conflict: Using someone else to fight your battles—gossip, triangulation, picking sides.

Risky choices: Going behind someone’s back, defying orders, making bold moves that provoke opposition.

Small rebellions: Not answering calls, “forgetting” an important date, doing something out of spite or self-defense.

Why It Matters
Conflict shown through action is what makes a story feel real, alive, and full of stakes. You don’t need a speech to sense the heat in the room. Readers get to participate, connecting the dots, reading the air. This is how real life works: most fights aren’t announced, they’re acted out, lived through, felt in the gut. When a character shows their struggle, you can’t look away—you want to know what’s really going on, what the next explosion will be, whether anyone will make it out clean.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

Fargo — Jerry and his wife: Every scene is tense, even when nobody’s yelling. Jerry’s secrets show up in his lies, awkwardness, and desperation.

The Godfather — Michael Corleone: His choices—who he protects, who he hurts, who he refuses to become—show his conflict with his family and himself.

Mad Men — Don Draper: His constant cheating, working late, and avoiding honest conversations show an endless, internal war.

The Office — Angela and Dwight: Their secret, on-again-off-again relationship is a war of gestures, furtive glances, petty sabotage.

Fleabag: The protagonist’s actions—sabotaging relationships, chasing chaos—constantly show her inner turmoil, without needing to spell it out.

Black Panther — T’Challa and Killmonger: Most of their conflict is in what they do—choosing sides, making risky moves, breaking tradition.

Get Out — Chris: The tension is all in the way people act around him—too nice, too invasive, too interested.

The Simpsons — Bart vs. Lisa: Their fights are more about pranks, sabotage, and silent wars than about what’s actually said.

BoJack Horseman: Characters hurt each other through neglect, self-destruction, and distance.

Euphoria — Rue and Jules: They never really say what’s wrong, but their decisions—staying, leaving, running, chasing—show all the fractures.

The Crown: Every episode is a masterclass in people refusing to say what’s wrong but living out the conflict anyway—through cold shoulders, missed events, or passive-aggressive tradition.

How It Changes the Story
When conflict is shown, not told, the story fills with suspense and subtext. You don’t have the answers, but you know something’s coming. It’s more satisfying for the reader—they get to watch the storm build, feel the pressure rise, and wonder when (or if) anyone will finally snap. Sometimes this keeps the story simmering for ages; sometimes the slow-burn is the point. When someone finally says what the problem is, it lands with ten times the force, because you’ve felt it all along.

For Writers
Let your characters act out the fight. Make them sabotage their own happiness, push away the people they love, pick fights with the world or themselves. Show the grind, the friction, the tiny rebellions and epic disasters. The best stories are built on what’s acted, not announced. If you can make the reader sense the conflict without a single speech, you’re halfway to a story that lives.


How to Spot Conflict in the Wild
3. They HIDE What the Problem Is

Not all conflict comes out swinging. Sometimes it’s buried—denied, camouflaged, or kept under lock and key. This is the sneakiest, most human kind of conflict: knowing there’s a problem, but doing anything not to face it, not to let anyone else see it, maybe not even letting yourself know it’s there. The result? A story full of tension, odd silences, weird detours, and pressure that never quite releases. Hidden conflict is where real drama cooks.

What Does It Look Like?
Hidden conflict lurks in the gaps—awkward pauses, the joke that lands flat, the way two people never quite look each other in the eye. You see it in characters who dodge questions, change the subject, over-explain simple things, or go out of their way to avoid someone. Maybe they attack a “safe” target instead of the real one, or lose their shit over nothing because they can’t name what’s really wrong. Sometimes they drown in distractions—work, habits, helping others, busy-ness—to keep from thinking about the problem. Maybe they start a pointless argument just to avoid the one that matters.

This is the fight that happens under the fight. No one ever says what the real issue is, but everyone feels it—the tension, the stakes, the threat that something could snap at any second.

Why Writers Use It
Hidden conflict is a goldmine for tension and realism. Real people rarely name their fights outright, especially the big, scary ones. We hide, we deflect, we use humor, we get mean, we sabotage, we freeze. Burying the fight keeps the story humming with subtext, suspense, and surprise—it forces the audience to read between the lines, wonder when the dam will break, and stay tuned for the truth underneath all the noise.

What to Watch For
Avoidance: Characters dodge each other, skip events, or change the subject whenever the real issue comes up.

Deflection: Picking smaller, unrelated fights. (“Why are you always late?” instead of “I’m scared you’ll leave me.”)

Overcompensation: Acting too nice, too cold, too busy, too perfect to cover up the mess.

Distraction: Pouring energy into work, hobbies, caretaking—anything to keep from facing the conflict.

Passive aggression: Snide remarks, the silent treatment, doing what’s asked—but badly.

Guilt trips: Making someone else feel bad so you don’t have to talk about what’s actually wrong.

Self-sabotage: Messing things up “by accident” so the conflict never comes to a head.

Breaking routines: Sudden changes—someone stops calling, skips dinner, starts new habits overnight.

Why It Matters
Hidden conflict is where stories get real, complicated, and dangerous. It’s not just what’s said, but what’s left unsaid that twists a relationship, keeps a family at war, or turns a workplace toxic. Every scene gets a charge, because everyone is on edge, waiting for the unspoken bomb to go off. The longer the fight stays hidden, the more power it has—when it finally breaks loose, the results are explosive, heartbreaking, or cathartic as hell.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

The Sopranos — Tony and Carmela: Their fights are rarely about what’s on the surface—most arguments are stand-ins for deeper betrayal, resentment, and loneliness.

Breaking Bad — Walt and Skyler: They dance around the truth for seasons—avoiding, lying, distracting, pretending nothing’s wrong even as everything falls apart.

Succession: Every character’s real fight is buried under sarcasm, jokes, and business talk; nobody says what they mean, but you can cut the tension with a knife.

The Royal Tenenbaums: The family’s weirdness, silence, and sabotage all mask a deep, shared wound nobody will name.

The Great Gatsby: The parties and drama are distractions; the real conflict—class, love, loss—simmers beneath the surface.

Lady Bird: The fights between Lady Bird and her mom are full of jokes, avoidance, and sudden blow-ups—never directly about the real pain underneath.

Ted Lasso (Rebecca and her ex-husband): She hides her anger and heartbreak behind professionalism and little power moves.

The West Wing — CJ and her dad: The conflict isn’t named—it’s all in what isn’t said, what’s avoided, and the rituals they use to cope.

Moonlight: Chiron rarely speaks about what’s hurting him, but every scene shows what he’s running from.

How It Changes the Story
Hidden conflict is a pressure cooker. The story builds and builds, simmering with scenes where nothing seems to happen—except for everything underneath. When the truth finally comes out, everything changes: relationships break, heal, or transform. Even if it never surfaces, that unresolved tension shapes every moment, every choice, every regret.

For Writers
Write the silence. Build scenes where the real fight is always lurking just outside the frame. Let your characters distract, joke, freeze, lash out, retreat—anything but say what’s really going on. The more your story lives in the unsaid, the more it feels like real life. And when the truth finally cracks through, let it break something open.


Potency Levels: Low — The Gentle Strain
What Low Potency Conflict Is
Low-potency conflict is the quiet tension that simmers beneath the surface. It’s not a fight, not a crisis—more like a pressure in the air, a vague sense that something’s off, or an unspoken difference that keeps people from fully connecting. Maybe it’s a disagreement left unaddressed, a feeling of not quite fitting in, or a clash of values that never erupts into argument. Most of the time, neither side would call it a conflict at all. It’s the weight of politeness, the itch of unsaid things, the hesitation before reaching out.

In low-potency mode, conflict doesn’t drive the plot forward—it colors the emotional world. It creates layers, moods, a hint of friction or melancholy, a subtle sense of distance between people. It isn’t nothing; it’s the thread that might snap, the question that might get asked, the silence before the storm.

How It Shows Up in Characters
Awkward silences: Conversations stall or shift topic just before things get real.

Subtle avoidance: Characters keep busy, dodge each other, or let messages go unanswered.

Microaggressions: Small jabs, jokes, or passive comments hint at underlying issues.

Walking on eggshells: Characters act extra careful, checking themselves before they speak.

Minor irritations: Sighing, eye-rolling, snark, or gentle teasing that never turns mean.

Withdrawal: Someone pulls back—physically or emotionally—without explanation.

Routine over truth: The familiar is chosen over the honest, keeping everything running smoothly but a little off.

Story Effects of Low-Potency Conflict
Sets a Mood: The story feels a little tense, uncertain, or bittersweet. Readers sense something unresolved, even when everyone acts “fine.”

Builds Relatability: It’s real—most of life is this, not screaming matches. We all know what it’s like to keep the peace while something festers.

Foreshadows Trouble or Change: This is often the canary in the coal mine. That subtle strain hints at bigger conflicts that could break through if the right pressure hits.

Deepens Character: People with quiet struggles feel more honest. They aren’t just bouncing off plot points; their inner world matters. Their caution or frustration, even if muted, makes them more believable.

What It Feels Like to Write
You linger: Scenes last a little longer, with pauses and unsaid things hanging in the air.

Dialogue skirts the issue: People hint, joke, or sidestep the real subject.

Action is small-scale: Nobody flips a table—they just forget a birthday, or stand at the edge of a group.

Pacing is gentle: There’s room to breathe, to notice how a glance or sigh changes everything.

Pop Culture Examples
Pam Beesly (The Office):
Her engagement to Roy is all low-grade conflict—quiet disappointment, unspoken doubts, halfhearted plans. Most of it shows up in silence, stolen glances, and what she doesn’t say.

Charlotte (Lost in Translation):
Her marriage feels strained, but there are almost no fights—just silences, distant phone calls, and missed connections. The conflict is all subtext.

My Neighbor Totoro (Mei & Satsuki’s family):
The sisters and their father navigate worry and longing with only minor flare-ups—the real strain is in missing their mother and trying to stay upbeat.

Jim Hopper (Stranger Things, early episodes):
His frustration with the town and his own grief comes out as mild irritation and avoidance, never open anger—at first.

Gilmore Girls (Lorelai and her parents):
Most conflict is low-key—awkward dinners, comments left hanging, politeness barely masking deep difference.

Kiki (Kiki’s Delivery Service):
Kiki feels out of place in her new town. The conflict is all internal—doubt, loneliness, the quiet push to belong.

Steven (Steven Universe, early on):
He senses the Gems are hiding things, but his struggle is gentle—hints, questions, soft tensions as he tries to find his place.

When to Use Low Potency as a Writer
When you want to build atmosphere and intimacy before things boil over.

When your story is about relationships, coming-of-age, or the day-to-day struggles that shape people.

When you want to show how conflict isn’t always loud—sometimes it’s the quiet strain that changes everything.

When the story is about restraint, not eruption; about holding it together, not breaking apart.

What Keeps Conflict Low?
Fear: Rocking the boat might cost too much.

Politeness: People don’t want to hurt each other, so they hold back.

Habit: They’re used to avoiding problems.

Denial: If you don’t talk about it, maybe it’ll go away.

Complacency: “Good enough” feels safer than being honest.

How Low Conflict Can Change
A new pressure—a guest, a secret, a mistake—can raise the stakes from gentle strain to open confrontation.

Sometimes it stays low, and the story becomes about living with tension, letting go, or finding quiet acceptance.

Sometimes, just one honest conversation is enough to change everything.

Low conflict is the heartbeat under the words.
Write it with nuance, patience, and respect for the ways people tiptoe around each other.
Let it simmer.
It’s how most stories start.

Here’s the parallel entry for **Medium Potency Conflict: The Friction Point**—same word count, depth, and format:

## Potency Levels: Medium — The Friction Point

### What Medium Potency Conflict Is

Medium-potency conflict is where friction turns into force. This isn’t a quiet strain or a background vibe—this is conflict stepping into the light. Now, something real stands in the way. The characters start pushing back, lines are drawn, and choices have consequences. This is where arguments happen, alliances shift, and risks are taken. It’s not all-out war, but nobody’s coasting anymore.

Medium conflict is about movement and escalation: not explosive, but undeniable. The air crackles. Every decision risks a reaction, every word might tip the balance. This is the story’s heartbeat getting faster—the middle act, where things get complicated and messy.

---

### How It Shows Up in Characters

* **Direct Confrontations:** Arguments, debates, pointed questions. People call each other out, challenge assumptions, or refuse to back down.
* **Taking Sides:** Characters start forming teams, building alliances, or drawing battle lines—sometimes openly, sometimes in secret.
* **Escalating Stakes:** Actions have visible consequences. The stakes go from “might be awkward” to “something could break.”
* **Active Avoidance:** Dodging someone, ghosting, or passive-aggressive behavior—there’s real energy behind not dealing with the problem.
* **Testing Boundaries:** Characters push rules, question authority, or take calculated risks.
* **Negotiation:** Compromise, bargaining, or manipulation—people try to get what they want, but now it costs something.

---

### Story Effects of Medium-Potency Conflict

**Builds Momentum:** Conflict now drives the story forward, not just flavoring it. Every clash changes something.

**Reveals Character:** You see what people will risk or fight for, and how they handle pressure.

**Heats Up Relationships:** Tension simmers—friendships strain, romances spark or fizzle, enemies become personal.

**Sharpens Stakes:** The reader feels what’s at risk, and that losing matters.

**Links Events:** Scenes connect—one fight leads to another, consequences stack up, and plotlines intertwine.

---

### What It Feels Like to Write

* **Scenes Snap:** Dialogue is sharper, actions are bolder. There’s more energy—less coasting, more conflict.
* **Emotional Peaks:** Hope, fear, anger, relief. You get to play with the full range of emotion as people bump up against each other.
* **Chain Reaction:** Choices have ripple effects. The outcome of one scene pushes the next.
* **Real Fallout:** No more “safe” space—someone is hurt, insulted, inspired, or changed by what happens.

---

### Pop Culture Examples

**Jim Halpert vs. Dwight Schrute (The Office):**
Their rivalry moves from low-key pranks to confrontations, sabotage, and loyalty tests. Every season, the stakes get higher.

**Hermione, Ron, and Harry (Harry Potter):**
Their friendship is tested by jealousy, misunderstandings, and differing priorities—especially in the later books.

**Katniss and Peeta (The Hunger Games):**
Alliances and betrayals become real, survival depends on choices, and even love gets weaponized.

**Troy and Gabriella (High School Musical 2):**
Conflicts between friendship, ambition, and romance heat up. Choices have consequences, and loyalties are tested.

**Moana vs. Her Father (Moana):**
Their conflict moves from “don’t go past the reef” to open argument and finally, defiance and change.

**Peter Parker (Spider-Man):**
He clashes with friends, mentors, and villains—juggling loyalty, secrecy, and the urge to do good.

**The Breakfast Club:**
Medium conflict is everywhere—misunderstandings, open arguments, and shifting alliances drive every scene.

---

### When to Use Medium Potency as a Writer

* When you want the story to build heat and speed—no more drifting.
* When relationships need to be tested, bent, or redefined.
* When you want characters to be brave, messy, or reveal what matters most.
* When the plot needs a reason to keep moving—characters push, and the world pushes back.

---

### What Keeps Conflict at Medium?

* **Doubt:** No one’s sure they’re right, or if the fight is worth it.
* **Fear of Going Too Far:** People risk hurt but aren’t ready to burn it all down.
* **Social Pressure:** There’s pushback, but not open rebellion—yet.
* **Mixed Feelings:** Wanting two things at once, torn loyalties.
* **Uncertainty:** Stakes are high, but consequences aren’t catastrophic…yet.

---

### How Medium Conflict Can Change

A spark—a betrayal, disaster, or victory—can ramp conflict up to high.
If characters retreat or back down, tension can slide back to low.

Sometimes the story is about escalation, sometimes it’s about learning to pull back before everything breaks.

Medium conflict is the heat before the boil.
Write it with energy, honesty, and an eye for the ways people collide.
Let it breathe, but don’t let it stall.
It’s the engine that keeps the story burning.

Here’s the parallel entry for **High Potency Conflict: The All-Out War**—matching your word count, depth, and vibe.

## Potency Levels: High — The All-Out War

### What High Potency Conflict Is

High-potency conflict is chaos unleashed—a clash so intense it takes over everything. There’s no “side plot,” no safe ground, no neutral party. The lines are drawn, the bridges are burned, and what’s at stake is nothing less than everything: loyalty, identity, love, survival, maybe even the world itself. High conflict rewrites the rules, upends every relationship, and forces characters into corners. If medium conflict is a bonfire, high is a wildfire—consuming, transforming, leaving nothing untouched.

This is the level where people fight to win or to destroy, not just to be right. Motives are naked, power dynamics shift with every move, and consequences are huge and permanent. Someone’s going down. The story can’t help but race to the climax.

### How It Shows Up in Characters

* **Open War:** Characters take bold, irreversible actions—betrayals, ultimatums, violence, declarations of love or hate.
* **Total Sacrifice:** Nothing is held back. Reputations, relationships, and even lives are risked or lost in the struggle.
* **Personal Meltdown:** People unravel—breakdowns, confessions, rage, and regret spill out in raw, public moments.
* **Black-and-White Thinking:** All nuance is gone. It’s us vs. them, right vs. wrong, now or never.
* **Desperation Moves:** Last-ditch efforts, wild gambles, big reveals. People will do anything to win—or to stop the other side.
* **Collateral Damage:** Innocent bystanders, entire systems, or worlds get caught in the crossfire.

### Story Effects of High-Potency Conflict

**Explosive Plot:** Every scene is dialed up. Cliffhangers, reversals, big showdowns—there’s no downtime.

**Irreversible Consequences:** When it’s over, nothing is the same. Losses are real, victories are costly, and scars don’t fade.

**Moral Blur:** Heroes make villain moves, villains get their humanity, and lines between right and wrong get smeared.

**Audience Hooked:** Stakes are so high, the reader has to see how it ends—even if it hurts.

**Everything Breaks:** Relationships fracture, families implode, systems collapse. This is the point of no return.

---

### What It Feels Like to Write

* **Every Scene Is a Climax:** No filler, no filler—just wave after wave of escalation.
* **Dialogue Burns:** Shouts, breakdowns, confessions, lies and truths that cut deep. Nobody’s polite.
* **Characters Snap:** They betray, confess, or finally say the thing they’ve buried for years.
* **Scenes Are Unstable:** The story shakes—anyone can turn, anything can happen.

### Pop Culture Examples

**Breaking Bad (Walter vs. Jesse, final season):**
All loyalty is shattered, violence erupts, and the only way out is total destruction.

**Avengers: Infinity War & Endgame:**
Friendships, lives, and even the universe itself are on the line. Alliances break, heroes fall, and nobody walks away unchanged.

**Macbeth (Shakespeare):**
Bloodshed, paranoia, madness. Everyone is either a casualty or a conspirator by the end.

**Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (Obi-Wan vs. Anakin):**
Mentor and student become mortal enemies—love turns to hatred, the world splits in two.

**Game of Thrones (Red Wedding, Battle for King’s Landing):**
Every grudge, alliance, and secret explodes. Nobody is safe; nothing is sacred.

**The Godfather, Part II:**
Michael’s war with his enemies (and his own family) leaves him alone—he wins, but loses his soul.

**Hamilton (Burr vs. Hamilton):**
Rivalry, ambition, and personal grievances erupt in a duel that ends one life and breaks another.

**Scarface (final act):**
Tony Montana destroys everything around him in his quest for power—he can’t stop until it’s all gone.

### When to Use High Potency as a Writer

* For finales, breaking points, and revolutions.
* When you want the story to be unforgettable—even if it hurts.
* When you want to see what happens when people can’t walk away.
* For stories about obsession, downfall, or impossible stakes.

---

### What Pushes Conflict to High?

* **Betrayal:** Trust shatters, and there’s no turning back.
* **Desperation:** It’s win or die—characters have nothing left to lose.
* **Ultimate Threat:** Something too precious to risk is threatened.
* **Escalation:** Every attempt to fix things just makes it worse.
* **Truth Exposed:** Secrets come out, forcing confrontation at any cost.

---

### How High Conflict Can Change

* Someone wins, but the victory is pyrrhic—what’s left is ash.
* The conflict ends in loss, death, or exile, and survivors must rebuild.
* Rarely, someone finds grace or a new beginning—but only after everything else is gone.

High conflict is nuclear.
Use it when you want to test what’s left standing after the storm.
Let it rip. Let it hurt.
See what breaks, and what (or who) survives the fire.

**Tools for Actively Controlling Potency Levels: Quick Reference**

---

### 1. Escalation and De-escalation

* **Raise Potency:**
  Drop a bomb in their path—a deadline, new rival, higher stakes, or unexpected twist. Force a choice with real cost.
  *Ex:* Pam’s engagement in *The Office* suddenly spikes Jim’s passive longing into bold, risky action.

* **Lower Potency:**
  Offer escape routes—distractions, comfort, disappointments, or a reason to let go. Let the world cool things down.
  *Ex:* After a big heartbreak, your character checks out, tells themselves they never really cared.

---

### 2. Change the Stakes

* **Bigger Consequences = Higher Potency**
  Wanting coffee? Low. Wanting to save a life? High.
  As the risk or reward grows, so does the need.

---

### 3. Play With Resistance

* **More Resistance:**
  Block the path. Add conflict, rivals, rules, guilt, or fear.
  Want + Friction = Heat.

* **Less Resistance:**
  Remove obstacles, make the want easy—desire cools, maybe fades out.
  No friction = no story.

---

### 4. Expose or Conceal the Want

* **Expose:**
  Desire goes public—now it’s risky, vulnerable, volatile.
  *Ex:* Secret crush becomes public confession.

* **Conceal:**
  If the want stays private, it simmers—unless the world turns up the heat.

---

### 5. Mix Internal and External Pressures

* Let the inside and outside worlds collide. Maybe your character is chill… until someone else wants the same thing, or threatens to take it away. Sparks fly.

---

### 6. Let Desire Shift Over Time

* **Potency is a spectrum:**
  Quiet want at first, tension builds, crisis hits—desire peaks.
  Show how setbacks, failures, and victories change the temperature.

---

### 7. Use Symbolic Objects/Actions

* Small gesture = small want (holding a letter, scrolling a feed).
  Big gesture = big want (sending the letter, storming a stage).
  Rituals and objects can “measure” desire on the page.

---

### 8. Physical and Emotional Signals

* **Low:** silence, staring, small talk, drifting.
* **Medium:** risk, confession, argument, visible stress.
* **High:** obsession, meltdown, yelling, ultimatums, burned bridges.

---

### 9. Other Characters Can Turn the Dial

* Allies stoke desire (“Go for it!”), rivals raise the stakes, mentors warn, family guilts.
  Desire always lives in a social ecosystem.

---

**Questions to Ask as You Write:**

* What does my character want—right now?
* How bad is the burn?
* What would push them to act (or to stop)?
* What stands in their way—and does it matter?
* What’s the real cost if they fail?
* If they win, is it enough—or does a new want show up?

---

**Dial Examples:**

* *Low → Medium*: Watching from afar → crush leaves soon, so they make a move.
* *Medium → High*: Wants promotion → rival cheats, so risks it all.
* *High → Low*: Obsessed with revenge → lets go, finds peace (or just collapses).

---

**Bottom line:**
Potency is a dial, not a switch. Scene by scene, you control the heat. If the story stalls, just ask:
**“How badly do they want it—right now? What would turn it up, or cool it down?”**



CONFLICT
What It Is
Conflict is the collision point—where desire meets resistance, where every “I want” runs into a wall. If desire is the fuel, conflict is the spark that turns it volatile. It’s not just two people yelling, or an explosion in the third act. Conflict is everything that stops a character from getting what they want: the world, other people, themselves, or just plain bad luck. Strip away the trappings, and story is want vs. obstacle, hope vs. reality, need vs. limit. It can be violent or invisible. It can be a world war or the tension in a single look. But without conflict, there’s no movement, no change, no stakes—just a flatline.

At its core, conflict is friction. It’s a locked door, a closed heart, a harsh truth, an impossible choice. It’s the uncomfortable place where your character is forced to either push, break, adapt, or collapse. Sometimes conflict is external—a villain, a rival, a society that says “no.” Sometimes it’s internal—fear, guilt, shame, contradiction, memory. Most of the time, it’s both at once, grinding against each other, pushing the story forward.

Conflict isn’t a “scene” or a “moment.” It’s the backbone. If you know what someone wants, you know what they’re going to run into. Without something in the way, there’s no story—only a wish list. But with conflict, you get drama, energy, transformation, and the pain (or thrill) that makes it all real.

The Deep Dive: What Makes Conflict
Conflict isn’t just fighting. It’s not only good vs. evil or hero vs. villain. Real conflict is layered, complicated, and alive in every corner of story. There are four classic sources:

Character vs. Character: Two people want different things, and there’s not enough for both. (Harry vs. Voldemort, Katniss vs. The Capitol, Marge Gunderson vs. the killer.)

Character vs. Society: One person against the crowd, the system, the expectation. (Erin Brockovich vs. corporate power, Jo March vs. gender roles, Shrek vs. the world.)

Character vs. Nature/World: The world itself is the problem—survival, disaster, disease, fate. (Mark Watney in The Martian, the shark in Jaws, nature in The Revenant.)

Character vs. Self: The deepest, rawest, often most relatable. Fear, addiction, shame, trauma, contradiction. (BoJack Horseman, Fleabag, Elsa in Frozen, Hamlet.)

But most stories braid these together—external battles feeding inner ones, and vice versa. Conflict is the friction between desire and what blocks it, but also the friction inside the person—the parts that fight, deny, or sabotage.

Sometimes conflict is loud: a showdown, a betrayal, a fight. Sometimes it’s silent: a lie, a stare, a secret kept for years. Sometimes it’s both at once. But it always, always matters.

Why Conflict Matters
Without conflict, you have a list of things that happened, not a story. Conflict is what gives events weight—what makes a win feel like relief or triumph, what makes a loss hurt, what makes a choice matter. It’s how you keep the reader hooked, scene by scene, paragraph by paragraph.

Conflict is also what reveals character. When someone is pushed, you see what’s real—what they’ll fight for, what they’ll let go, what lines they’ll cross or hold. It exposes motive, fear, loyalty, secret hunger, true weakness. The person who smiles until someone challenges them, the friend who disappears when shit gets hard, the villain who folds when shown kindness—all revealed by conflict.

Conflict creates stakes. If nothing stands in the way, then nothing is at risk. Conflict says: this costs something. You could lose. You might get hurt. You might have to change, or admit you were wrong, or destroy something you love to get what you want.

Without conflict, readers and viewers drift. They sense nothing can go wrong. They stop caring, because the outcome is never in doubt, and the struggle is never real. With conflict, everything’s alive.

Why Most Stories Fail Without It
You know the feeling: you’re reading or watching and everything just slides by. The prose might be pretty. The characters might be quirky. But nothing hooks you, because nothing is being tested. Maybe there’s a goal, but no real obstacle—just a series of events. Maybe the “conflict” is an afterthought, or never actually threatens the main want. You close the book, leave the theater, turn off the show, and forget it ever existed.

Stories fall flat when conflict is too soft, too distant, too easy to overcome, or when it never evolves. If a character wants something and always gets it, or if the world never says “no,” you don’t have a story—you have a wish-fulfillment fantasy. And unless it’s yours, you probably don’t care.

Conflict also fails when it’s just noise—fights for no reason, drama that doesn’t come from what people actually want or fear. Real conflict is specific. It’s about this character, this moment, this risk. If conflict feels tacked on, mechanical, or disconnected from the heart of the story, the whole thing collapses.

How Conflict Is Often Misunderstood
A lot of writers think conflict means “make characters yell at each other.” Or “add a villain.” Or “put in a big set-piece.” But that’s surface. Conflict isn’t just opposition for opposition’s sake. It’s about the collision of genuine wants, needs, values, or fears. Sometimes it’s quiet. Sometimes it’s brutal. Sometimes the best conflict is inside one person—wanting and not wanting, loving and resenting at the same time.

Some writers dodge conflict because it feels artificial, or “mean,” or they don’t want their characters to suffer. But a story where nothing is risked, nothing is lost, and nothing hurts is a story that never moves. Conflict is the place where you show what matters—where the mask cracks, where the person is revealed.

Other writers mistake conflict for plot twists. They add surprises but forget to make the struggle meaningful. Conflict is about the meaning of struggle, not just the existence of it.

Conflict is not an interruption—it’s the pulse.

How Conflict Powers Everything
Desire: Without resistance, want is easy. With conflict, want gets tested, twisted, sharpened.

Theme: What your character fights for (or gives up) shows what the story really means.

Plot: Every turn, every setback, every reversal is a new collision of want and obstacle.

Scene: Every scene has a power dynamic—a negotiation, a risk, a test.

Voice: Conflict gives the writing edge, urgency, rhythm, and truth.

Conflict is why anything in a story feels real.

The Many Faces of Conflict
Conflict isn’t just “I want X, you want Y.” It’s:

Competing desires in the same person (love vs. duty, hope vs. fear).

Silent sabotage—characters who undermine themselves or others out of jealousy, shame, or panic.

Comedy born of misunderstanding or misalignment (The Office, Schitt’s Creek, Brooklyn Nine-Nine).

Tragedy from the world being what it is (12 Years a Slave, Brokeback Mountain).

The war between truth and lie (Breaking Bad, Succession, Game of Thrones).

The mess of family, friendship, romance, loyalty, betrayal, regret.

Conflict is everywhere: in the rules, the weather, the past, the body, the mind. Every story you love is built on layers of it.

The Writer’s Job
Your job is not to avoid conflict, but to lean into it. Make it real, make it hurt, make it mean something. If it’s hidden, show the cracks. If it’s obvious, raise the stakes. Track how it changes. If you know what every character wants—and what’s in the way, outside and inside—you’ll never run out of scenes, never run out of risk.

Push your characters to the wall. Don’t rescue them too soon. The reader is there for the fight.


You Know What It’s Like to Face Conflict
Let’s cut through the noise: you already understand conflict because you’ve survived it—hell, you’re probably living it right now. You know what it’s like to want something and run face-first into a wall. Maybe you’ve fought with family, lost friends, been boxed in by the system, or spent years wrestling with your own mind. You’ve held back words you wanted to say, burned bridges you wish you hadn’t, lied to protect yourself, or risked everything for something you needed. Maybe you’ve been the villain in someone else’s story, or found out too late that you were fighting yourself the whole time.

You don’t need to be taught what conflict feels like. You know what it is to want, and to be stopped. You know what it’s like to have two impossible choices, to bite your tongue, to slam a door, to wish the world were different. You’ve hurt people and been hurt, picked fights and tried to avoid them, lost battles no one else even saw. Conflict is the air you breathe as a human being; it’s the reason you get out of bed, the reason you lie awake at night, the reason you keep showing up for life even when it’s brutal.

Every time you write, you’re writing your own wars. The stories that matter—the ones that stick—are built from the friction in your own life. You don’t have to fake it or manufacture drama: you just have to be honest. Whether you’re blowing up cities or writing two people staring each other down across a table, it’s all the same. Conflict is the crackle of living. You get it. You’ve lived it. That’s why you can write it.

Every story you create is about someone colliding with the world, with someone else, or with themselves—sometimes all at once. Your job isn’t to invent conflict, it’s to recognize it and let it burn on the page.

How to Spot Conflict in the Wild
1. They SAY What the Problem Is

Sometimes, conflict walks right up and tells you its name. A character (or narrator) lays it out—what’s wrong, who’s in the way, what hurts, what’s broken, what they’re fighting for or against. This is the surface-level, no-bullshit version: the obstacle or opposition is spoken out loud, written into the dialogue, or even thrown in the reader’s face through narration. No subtext, no puzzle—just the problem, announced for all to see. You don’t have to guess where the tension is coming from; they hand it to you.

What Does It Look Like?
It could be an argument where someone shouts, “You’re always trying to control me!” It might be a whispered confession (“I’m scared I’ll never be good enough”), or a battle speech (“We will not go quietly into the night!”). Sometimes it’s a complaint, sometimes a threat, sometimes a desperate plea. Maybe it’s someone admitting they hate their job, love the wrong person, or can’t stand the person next to them. When conflict is spoken, the air shifts—everyone knows what’s at stake, what the fight is, what has to be faced.

Why Writers Use It
Letting a character say what the conflict is does a couple of things. First, it makes the stakes crystal clear for the audience—no guessing games, no ambiguity. You know who’s on what side, what the stakes are, and why everything matters. Spoken conflict draws a line in the sand. It raises the heat instantly because you know a confrontation is coming (or already here). Sometimes, having the characters admit what the fight is about forces everyone—including the audience—to stop pretending and actually deal with the mess.

What to Listen For
Direct accusations: “You lied to me.” / “This is all your fault.”

Ultimatums: “If you walk out that door, don’t come back.”

Stated fears: “I’m afraid you don’t love me anymore.”

Declarations of war: “I won’t let you win.” / “Over my dead body.”

Vulnerable admissions: “I can’t keep pretending everything’s okay.”

Announced rivalries: “I’ve always wanted to beat you.”

Simple, honest confession: “We can’t go on like this.”

Why It Matters
Spoken conflict gives you a spotlight. You know exactly what the story is wrestling with—no hidden agendas (yet). Every action, every bit of tension, every side-eye or slammed door can be traced back to this moment. The plot now has direction: you know what’s at risk, who’s got something to lose, and who’s in the way. It makes characters vulnerable, too. Saying “this is what’s wrong” is a risk; it opens the door to being hurt, challenged, or changed. The fallout is instant—once you say the fight out loud, there’s no stuffing it back in the box.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

The Lord of the Rings — Frodo to Sam: “I can’t do this, Sam.” (Says the conflict—overwhelmed, at the edge, naming the struggle directly.)

Breaking Bad — Skyler to Walt: “I’m afraid of you.” (No more pretending; the fear is the conflict.)

Frozen — Elsa: “You can’t marry a man you just met!” (Calling out the real tension, refusing to play along.)

The Hunger Games — Katniss: “If we burn, you burn with us!” (Declares open war, shifts the power.)

The Office — Jim to Michael: “You’re not my friend. You’re my boss.” (Honest conflict in the open, breaking all the subtext.)

Game of Thrones — Cersei: “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.” (Announces the whole show’s conflict in a single line.)

Spider-Man 2 — Peter Parker to Aunt May: “I’m Spider-Man. No more secrets.” (The conflict between truth and safety is spoken.)

Fleabag — Priest to Fleabag: “Why do you keep using sex to avoid real intimacy?” (Names the root conflict, making the next move unavoidable.)

Star Wars — Luke to Vader: “I’ll never join you!” (Clear, stated opposition.)

Succession — Kendall Roy: “I’m better than you.” (Every episode is built on saying the quiet part loud.)

How It Changes the Story
When the conflict is out in the open, the tension gets teeth. Everyone in the story (and the reader) knows the real terms. There’s no more playing nice. The path ahead is all about dealing with this declared war, hurt, or challenge. Sometimes, the moment a conflict is spoken is the moment everything else becomes possible—resolution, escalation, collapse.

Characters who say what the problem is can’t hide behind jokes or politeness anymore. They risk real change. The air is charged, and the fallout can be huge: relationships break, alliances shift, the truth is unavoidable.

For Writers
Don’t be afraid to let your characters name the fight. Let them say what hurts, what scares them, what they want to destroy or protect. Direct conflict doesn’t make a story less deep—it makes it urgent and honest. And the sooner you get it out there, the sooner you can let the real chaos begin.


How to Spot Conflict in the Wild
2. They SHOW What the Problem Is

Conflict doesn’t have to be shouted or spelled out. Most of the time, you’ll see it: in what characters do, what they refuse to do, the boundaries they set, the lines they cross, the ways they grind against each other (or the world). Sometimes no one ever says what’s wrong, but the actions—the friction, avoidance, sabotage, open defiance—shout it at full volume. The war is in the way they move, the choices they make, the trouble they invite or run from. Conflict leaks out, leaks in, changes the air around every character.

What Does It Look Like?
You spot it in their reactions—tense shoulders, storming out, slamming doors, silent treatments, sharp glances. Conflict is in the patterns: two people who always argue, a hero who can’t stop breaking rules, a family who only shows up at holidays to fight about the past. It’s what people won’t do—refusing to apologize, refusing to ask for help, refusing to show up. Sometimes it’s in the sabotage: a character undermines their own success, burns bridges, pushes people away before they can be left. Maybe someone picks a fight just to feel alive. Maybe a group closes ranks when an outsider appears. The fight is everywhere except the dialogue.

Why Writers Use It
Showing conflict, rather than saying it, pulls the reader into the world—no spoon-feeding, no neon signs, just tension you feel. The story gains depth and danger because the reader gets to piece it together, tracking the patterns, watching the fallout, knowing something’s going to break. This is where stories breathe: in what’s not said but what can’t be avoided. Showing conflict lets you layer subtext, complexity, and makes the audience do a little detective work (which is always more satisfying).

What to Watch For
Patterned resistance: Characters always saying no, dragging their feet, making everything harder than it needs to be.

Silent stand-offs: Tense meals, awkward car rides, long pauses.

Sabotage: Doing things that make the problem worse, even (especially) when it doesn’t make sense.

Repeated arguments: Fighting about little things when the big problem is left unsaid.

Physical actions: Slamming doors, walking away, breaking something valuable, refusing to leave or refusing to stay.

Third-party conflict: Using someone else to fight your battles—gossip, triangulation, picking sides.

Risky choices: Going behind someone’s back, defying orders, making bold moves that provoke opposition.

Small rebellions: Not answering calls, “forgetting” an important date, doing something out of spite or self-defense.

Why It Matters
Conflict shown through action is what makes a story feel real, alive, and full of stakes. You don’t need a speech to sense the heat in the room. Readers get to participate, connecting the dots, reading the air. This is how real life works: most fights aren’t announced, they’re acted out, lived through, felt in the gut. When a character shows their struggle, you can’t look away—you want to know what’s really going on, what the next explosion will be, whether anyone will make it out clean.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

Fargo — Jerry and his wife: Every scene is tense, even when nobody’s yelling. Jerry’s secrets show up in his lies, awkwardness, and desperation.

The Godfather — Michael Corleone: His choices—who he protects, who he hurts, who he refuses to become—show his conflict with his family and himself.

Mad Men — Don Draper: His constant cheating, working late, and avoiding honest conversations show an endless, internal war.

The Office — Angela and Dwight: Their secret, on-again-off-again relationship is a war of gestures, furtive glances, petty sabotage.

Fleabag: The protagonist’s actions—sabotaging relationships, chasing chaos—constantly show her inner turmoil, without needing to spell it out.

Black Panther — T’Challa and Killmonger: Most of their conflict is in what they do—choosing sides, making risky moves, breaking tradition.

Get Out — Chris: The tension is all in the way people act around him—too nice, too invasive, too interested.

The Simpsons — Bart vs. Lisa: Their fights are more about pranks, sabotage, and silent wars than about what’s actually said.

BoJack Horseman: Characters hurt each other through neglect, self-destruction, and distance.

Euphoria — Rue and Jules: They never really say what’s wrong, but their decisions—staying, leaving, running, chasing—show all the fractures.

The Crown: Every episode is a masterclass in people refusing to say what’s wrong but living out the conflict anyway—through cold shoulders, missed events, or passive-aggressive tradition.

How It Changes the Story
When conflict is shown, not told, the story fills with suspense and subtext. You don’t have the answers, but you know something’s coming. It’s more satisfying for the reader—they get to watch the storm build, feel the pressure rise, and wonder when (or if) anyone will finally snap. Sometimes this keeps the story simmering for ages; sometimes the slow-burn is the point. When someone finally says what the problem is, it lands with ten times the force, because you’ve felt it all along.

For Writers
Let your characters act out the fight. Make them sabotage their own happiness, push away the people they love, pick fights with the world or themselves. Show the grind, the friction, the tiny rebellions and epic disasters. The best stories are built on what’s acted, not announced. If you can make the reader sense the conflict without a single speech, you’re halfway to a story that lives.


How to Spot Conflict in the Wild
3. They HIDE What the Problem Is

Not all conflict comes out swinging. Sometimes it’s buried—denied, camouflaged, or kept under lock and key. This is the sneakiest, most human kind of conflict: knowing there’s a problem, but doing anything not to face it, not to let anyone else see it, maybe not even letting yourself know it’s there. The result? A story full of tension, odd silences, weird detours, and pressure that never quite releases. Hidden conflict is where real drama cooks.

What Does It Look Like?
Hidden conflict lurks in the gaps—awkward pauses, the joke that lands flat, the way two people never quite look each other in the eye. You see it in characters who dodge questions, change the subject, over-explain simple things, or go out of their way to avoid someone. Maybe they attack a “safe” target instead of the real one, or lose their shit over nothing because they can’t name what’s really wrong. Sometimes they drown in distractions—work, habits, helping others, busy-ness—to keep from thinking about the problem. Maybe they start a pointless argument just to avoid the one that matters.

This is the fight that happens under the fight. No one ever says what the real issue is, but everyone feels it—the tension, the stakes, the threat that something could snap at any second.

Why Writers Use It
Hidden conflict is a goldmine for tension and realism. Real people rarely name their fights outright, especially the big, scary ones. We hide, we deflect, we use humor, we get mean, we sabotage, we freeze. Burying the fight keeps the story humming with subtext, suspense, and surprise—it forces the audience to read between the lines, wonder when the dam will break, and stay tuned for the truth underneath all the noise.

What to Watch For
Avoidance: Characters dodge each other, skip events, or change the subject whenever the real issue comes up.

Deflection: Picking smaller, unrelated fights. (“Why are you always late?” instead of “I’m scared you’ll leave me.”)

Overcompensation: Acting too nice, too cold, too busy, too perfect to cover up the mess.

Distraction: Pouring energy into work, hobbies, caretaking—anything to keep from facing the conflict.

Passive aggression: Snide remarks, the silent treatment, doing what’s asked—but badly.

Guilt trips: Making someone else feel bad so you don’t have to talk about what’s actually wrong.

Self-sabotage: Messing things up “by accident” so the conflict never comes to a head.

Breaking routines: Sudden changes—someone stops calling, skips dinner, starts new habits overnight.

Why It Matters
Hidden conflict is where stories get real, complicated, and dangerous. It’s not just what’s said, but what’s left unsaid that twists a relationship, keeps a family at war, or turns a workplace toxic. Every scene gets a charge, because everyone is on edge, waiting for the unspoken bomb to go off. The longer the fight stays hidden, the more power it has—when it finally breaks loose, the results are explosive, heartbreaking, or cathartic as hell.

Where You’ll See It
Pop Culture Examples:

The Sopranos — Tony and Carmela: Their fights are rarely about what’s on the surface—most arguments are stand-ins for deeper betrayal, resentment, and loneliness.

Breaking Bad — Walt and Skyler: They dance around the truth for seasons—avoiding, lying, distracting, pretending nothing’s wrong even as everything falls apart.

Succession: Every character’s real fight is buried under sarcasm, jokes, and business talk; nobody says what they mean, but you can cut the tension with a knife.

The Royal Tenenbaums: The family’s weirdness, silence, and sabotage all mask a deep, shared wound nobody will name.

The Great Gatsby: The parties and drama are distractions; the real conflict—class, love, loss—simmers beneath the surface.

Lady Bird: The fights between Lady Bird and her mom are full of jokes, avoidance, and sudden blow-ups—never directly about the real pain underneath.

Ted Lasso (Rebecca and her ex-husband): She hides her anger and heartbreak behind professionalism and little power moves.

The West Wing — CJ and her dad: The conflict isn’t named—it’s all in what isn’t said, what’s avoided, and the rituals they use to cope.

Moonlight: Chiron rarely speaks about what’s hurting him, but every scene shows what he’s running from.

How It Changes the Story
Hidden conflict is a pressure cooker. The story builds and builds, simmering with scenes where nothing seems to happen—except for everything underneath. When the truth finally comes out, everything changes: relationships break, heal, or transform. Even if it never surfaces, that unresolved tension shapes every moment, every choice, every regret.

For Writers
Write the silence. Build scenes where the real fight is always lurking just outside the frame. Let your characters distract, joke, freeze, lash out, retreat—anything but say what’s really going on. The more your story lives in the unsaid, the more it feels like real life. And when the truth finally cracks through, let it break something open.


Potency Levels: Low — The Gentle Strain
What Low Potency Conflict Is
Low-potency conflict is the quiet tension that simmers beneath the surface. It’s not a fight, not a crisis—more like a pressure in the air, a vague sense that something’s off, or an unspoken difference that keeps people from fully connecting. Maybe it’s a disagreement left unaddressed, a feeling of not quite fitting in, or a clash of values that never erupts into argument. Most of the time, neither side would call it a conflict at all. It’s the weight of politeness, the itch of unsaid things, the hesitation before reaching out.

In low-potency mode, conflict doesn’t drive the plot forward—it colors the emotional world. It creates layers, moods, a hint of friction or melancholy, a subtle sense of distance between people. It isn’t nothing; it’s the thread that might snap, the question that might get asked, the silence before the storm.

How It Shows Up in Characters
Awkward silences: Conversations stall or shift topic just before things get real.

Subtle avoidance: Characters keep busy, dodge each other, or let messages go unanswered.

Microaggressions: Small jabs, jokes, or passive comments hint at underlying issues.

Walking on eggshells: Characters act extra careful, checking themselves before they speak.

Minor irritations: Sighing, eye-rolling, snark, or gentle teasing that never turns mean.

Withdrawal: Someone pulls back—physically or emotionally—without explanation.

Routine over truth: The familiar is chosen over the honest, keeping everything running smoothly but a little off.

Story Effects of Low-Potency Conflict
Sets a Mood: The story feels a little tense, uncertain, or bittersweet. Readers sense something unresolved, even when everyone acts “fine.”

Builds Relatability: It’s real—most of life is this, not screaming matches. We all know what it’s like to keep the peace while something festers.

Foreshadows Trouble or Change: This is often the canary in the coal mine. That subtle strain hints at bigger conflicts that could break through if the right pressure hits.

Deepens Character: People with quiet struggles feel more honest. They aren’t just bouncing off plot points; their inner world matters. Their caution or frustration, even if muted, makes them more believable.

What It Feels Like to Write
You linger: Scenes last a little longer, with pauses and unsaid things hanging in the air.

Dialogue skirts the issue: People hint, joke, or sidestep the real subject.

Action is small-scale: Nobody flips a table—they just forget a birthday, or stand at the edge of a group.

Pacing is gentle: There’s room to breathe, to notice how a glance or sigh changes everything.

Pop Culture Examples
Pam Beesly (The Office):
Her engagement to Roy is all low-grade conflict—quiet disappointment, unspoken doubts, halfhearted plans. Most of it shows up in silence, stolen glances, and what she doesn’t say.

Charlotte (Lost in Translation):
Her marriage feels strained, but there are almost no fights—just silences, distant phone calls, and missed connections. The conflict is all subtext.

My Neighbor Totoro (Mei & Satsuki’s family):
The sisters and their father navigate worry and longing with only minor flare-ups—the real strain is in missing their mother and trying to stay upbeat.

Jim Hopper (Stranger Things, early episodes):
His frustration with the town and his own grief comes out as mild irritation and avoidance, never open anger—at first.

Gilmore Girls (Lorelai and her parents):
Most conflict is low-key—awkward dinners, comments left hanging, politeness barely masking deep difference.

Kiki (Kiki’s Delivery Service):
Kiki feels out of place in her new town. The conflict is all internal—doubt, loneliness, the quiet push to belong.

Steven (Steven Universe, early on):
He senses the Gems are hiding things, but his struggle is gentle—hints, questions, soft tensions as he tries to find his place.

When to Use Low Potency as a Writer
When you want to build atmosphere and intimacy before things boil over.

When your story is about relationships, coming-of-age, or the day-to-day struggles that shape people.

When you want to show how conflict isn’t always loud—sometimes it’s the quiet strain that changes everything.

When the story is about restraint, not eruption; about holding it together, not breaking apart.

What Keeps Conflict Low?
Fear: Rocking the boat might cost too much.

Politeness: People don’t want to hurt each other, so they hold back.

Habit: They’re used to avoiding problems.

Denial: If you don’t talk about it, maybe it’ll go away.

Complacency: “Good enough” feels safer than being honest.

How Low Conflict Can Change
A new pressure—a guest, a secret, a mistake—can raise the stakes from gentle strain to open confrontation.

Sometimes it stays low, and the story becomes about living with tension, letting go, or finding quiet acceptance.

Sometimes, just one honest conversation is enough to change everything.

Low conflict is the heartbeat under the words.
Write it with nuance, patience, and respect for the ways people tiptoe around each other.
Let it simmer.
It’s how most stories start.

Here’s the parallel entry for **Medium Potency Conflict: The Friction Point**—same word count, depth, and format:

## Potency Levels: Medium — The Friction Point

### What Medium Potency Conflict Is

Medium-potency conflict is where friction turns into force. This isn’t a quiet strain or a background vibe—this is conflict stepping into the light. Now, something real stands in the way. The characters start pushing back, lines are drawn, and choices have consequences. This is where arguments happen, alliances shift, and risks are taken. It’s not all-out war, but nobody’s coasting anymore.

Medium conflict is about movement and escalation: not explosive, but undeniable. The air crackles. Every decision risks a reaction, every word might tip the balance. This is the story’s heartbeat getting faster—the middle act, where things get complicated and messy.

---

### How It Shows Up in Characters

* **Direct Confrontations:** Arguments, debates, pointed questions. People call each other out, challenge assumptions, or refuse to back down.
* **Taking Sides:** Characters start forming teams, building alliances, or drawing battle lines—sometimes openly, sometimes in secret.
* **Escalating Stakes:** Actions have visible consequences. The stakes go from “might be awkward” to “something could break.”
* **Active Avoidance:** Dodging someone, ghosting, or passive-aggressive behavior—there’s real energy behind not dealing with the problem.
* **Testing Boundaries:** Characters push rules, question authority, or take calculated risks.
* **Negotiation:** Compromise, bargaining, or manipulation—people try to get what they want, but now it costs something.

---

### Story Effects of Medium-Potency Conflict

**Builds Momentum:** Conflict now drives the story forward, not just flavoring it. Every clash changes something.

**Reveals Character:** You see what people will risk or fight for, and how they handle pressure.

**Heats Up Relationships:** Tension simmers—friendships strain, romances spark or fizzle, enemies become personal.

**Sharpens Stakes:** The reader feels what’s at risk, and that losing matters.

**Links Events:** Scenes connect—one fight leads to another, consequences stack up, and plotlines intertwine.

---

### What It Feels Like to Write

* **Scenes Snap:** Dialogue is sharper, actions are bolder. There’s more energy—less coasting, more conflict.
* **Emotional Peaks:** Hope, fear, anger, relief. You get to play with the full range of emotion as people bump up against each other.
* **Chain Reaction:** Choices have ripple effects. The outcome of one scene pushes the next.
* **Real Fallout:** No more “safe” space—someone is hurt, insulted, inspired, or changed by what happens.

---

### Pop Culture Examples

**Jim Halpert vs. Dwight Schrute (The Office):**
Their rivalry moves from low-key pranks to confrontations, sabotage, and loyalty tests. Every season, the stakes get higher.

**Hermione, Ron, and Harry (Harry Potter):**
Their friendship is tested by jealousy, misunderstandings, and differing priorities—especially in the later books.

**Katniss and Peeta (The Hunger Games):**
Alliances and betrayals become real, survival depends on choices, and even love gets weaponized.

**Troy and Gabriella (High School Musical 2):**
Conflicts between friendship, ambition, and romance heat up. Choices have consequences, and loyalties are tested.

**Moana vs. Her Father (Moana):**
Their conflict moves from “don’t go past the reef” to open argument and finally, defiance and change.

**Peter Parker (Spider-Man):**
He clashes with friends, mentors, and villains—juggling loyalty, secrecy, and the urge to do good.

**The Breakfast Club:**
Medium conflict is everywhere—misunderstandings, open arguments, and shifting alliances drive every scene.

---

### When to Use Medium Potency as a Writer

* When you want the story to build heat and speed—no more drifting.
* When relationships need to be tested, bent, or redefined.
* When you want characters to be brave, messy, or reveal what matters most.
* When the plot needs a reason to keep moving—characters push, and the world pushes back.

---

### What Keeps Conflict at Medium?

* **Doubt:** No one’s sure they’re right, or if the fight is worth it.
* **Fear of Going Too Far:** People risk hurt but aren’t ready to burn it all down.
* **Social Pressure:** There’s pushback, but not open rebellion—yet.
* **Mixed Feelings:** Wanting two things at once, torn loyalties.
* **Uncertainty:** Stakes are high, but consequences aren’t catastrophic…yet.

---

### How Medium Conflict Can Change

A spark—a betrayal, disaster, or victory—can ramp conflict up to high.
If characters retreat or back down, tension can slide back to low.

Sometimes the story is about escalation, sometimes it’s about learning to pull back before everything breaks.

Medium conflict is the heat before the boil.
Write it with energy, honesty, and an eye for the ways people collide.
Let it breathe, but don’t let it stall.
It’s the engine that keeps the story burning.

Here’s the parallel entry for **High Potency Conflict: The All-Out War**—matching your word count, depth, and vibe.

---

## Potency Levels: High — The All-Out War

### What High Potency Conflict Is

High-potency conflict is chaos unleashed—a clash so intense it takes over everything. There’s no “side plot,” no safe ground, no neutral party. The lines are drawn, the bridges are burned, and what’s at stake is nothing less than everything: loyalty, identity, love, survival, maybe even the world itself. High conflict rewrites the rules, upends every relationship, and forces characters into corners. If medium conflict is a bonfire, high is a wildfire—consuming, transforming, leaving nothing untouched.

This is the level where people fight to win or to destroy, not just to be right. Motives are naked, power dynamics shift with every move, and consequences are huge and permanent. Someone’s going down. The story can’t help but race to the climax.

---

### How It Shows Up in Characters

* **Open War:** Characters take bold, irreversible actions—betrayals, ultimatums, violence, declarations of love or hate.
* **Total Sacrifice:** Nothing is held back. Reputations, relationships, and even lives are risked or lost in the struggle.
* **Personal Meltdown:** People unravel—breakdowns, confessions, rage, and regret spill out in raw, public moments.
* **Black-and-White Thinking:** All nuance is gone. It’s us vs. them, right vs. wrong, now or never.
* **Desperation Moves:** Last-ditch efforts, wild gambles, big reveals. People will do anything to win—or to stop the other side.
* **Collateral Damage:** Innocent bystanders, entire systems, or worlds get caught in the crossfire.

---

### Story Effects of High-Potency Conflict

**Explosive Plot:** Every scene is dialed up. Cliffhangers, reversals, big showdowns—there’s no downtime.

**Irreversible Consequences:** When it’s over, nothing is the same. Losses are real, victories are costly, and scars don’t fade.

**Moral Blur:** Heroes make villain moves, villains get their humanity, and lines between right and wrong get smeared.

**Audience Hooked:** Stakes are so high, the reader has to see how it ends—even if it hurts.

**Everything Breaks:** Relationships fracture, families implode, systems collapse. This is the point of no return.

---

### What It Feels Like to Write

* **Every Scene Is a Climax:** No filler, no filler—just wave after wave of escalation.
* **Dialogue Burns:** Shouts, breakdowns, confessions, lies and truths that cut deep. Nobody’s polite.
* **Characters Snap:** They betray, confess, or finally say the thing they’ve buried for years.
* **Scenes Are Unstable:** The story shakes—anyone can turn, anything can happen.

---

### Pop Culture Examples

**Breaking Bad (Walter vs. Jesse, final season):**
All loyalty is shattered, violence erupts, and the only way out is total destruction.

**Avengers: Infinity War & Endgame:**
Friendships, lives, and even the universe itself are on the line. Alliances break, heroes fall, and nobody walks away unchanged.

**Macbeth (Shakespeare):**
Bloodshed, paranoia, madness. Everyone is either a casualty or a conspirator by the end.

**Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (Obi-Wan vs. Anakin):**
Mentor and student become mortal enemies—love turns to hatred, the world splits in two.

**Game of Thrones (Red Wedding, Battle for King’s Landing):**
Every grudge, alliance, and secret explodes. Nobody is safe; nothing is sacred.

**The Godfather, Part II:**
Michael’s war with his enemies (and his own family) leaves him alone—he wins, but loses his soul.

**Hamilton (Burr vs. Hamilton):**
Rivalry, ambition, and personal grievances erupt in a duel that ends one life and breaks another.

**Scarface (final act):**
Tony Montana destroys everything around him in his quest for power—he can’t stop until it’s all gone.

---

### When to Use High Potency as a Writer

* For finales, breaking points, and revolutions.
* When you want the story to be unforgettable—even if it hurts.
* When you want to see what happens when people can’t walk away.
* For stories about obsession, downfall, or impossible stakes.

---

### What Pushes Conflict to High?

* **Betrayal:** Trust shatters, and there’s no turning back.
* **Desperation:** It’s win or die—characters have nothing left to lose.
* **Ultimate Threat:** Something too precious to risk is threatened.
* **Escalation:** Every attempt to fix things just makes it worse.
* **Truth Exposed:** Secrets come out, forcing confrontation at any cost.

---

### How High Conflict Can Change

* Someone wins, but the victory is pyrrhic—what’s left is ash.
* The conflict ends in loss, death, or exile, and survivors must rebuild.
* Rarely, someone finds grace or a new beginning—but only after everything else is gone.

High conflict is nuclear.
Use it when you want to test what’s left standing after the storm.
Let it rip. Let it hurt.
See what breaks, and what (or who) survives the fire.

**Tools for Actively Controlling Potency Levels: Quick Reference**

---

### 1. Escalation and De-escalation

* **Raise Potency:**
  Drop a bomb in their path—a deadline, new rival, higher stakes, or unexpected twist. Force a choice with real cost.
  *Ex:* Pam’s engagement in *The Office* suddenly spikes Jim’s passive longing into bold, risky action.

* **Lower Potency:**
  Offer escape routes—distractions, comfort, disappointments, or a reason to let go. Let the world cool things down.
  *Ex:* After a big heartbreak, your character checks out, tells themselves they never really cared.

---

### 2. Change the Stakes

* **Bigger Consequences = Higher Potency**
  Wanting coffee? Low. Wanting to save a life? High.
  As the risk or reward grows, so does the need.

---

### 3. Play With Resistance

* **More Resistance:**
  Block the path. Add conflict, rivals, rules, guilt, or fear.
  Want + Friction = Heat.

* **Less Resistance:**
  Remove obstacles, make the want easy—desire cools, maybe fades out.
  No friction = no story.

---

### 4. Expose or Conceal the Want

* **Expose:**
  Desire goes public—now it’s risky, vulnerable, volatile.
  *Ex:* Secret crush becomes public confession.

* **Conceal:**
  If the want stays private, it simmers—unless the world turns up the heat.

---

### 5. Mix Internal and External Pressures

* Let the inside and outside worlds collide. Maybe your character is chill… until someone else wants the same thing, or threatens to take it away. Sparks fly.

---

### 6. Let Desire Shift Over Time

* **Potency is a spectrum:**
  Quiet want at first, tension builds, crisis hits—desire peaks.
  Show how setbacks, failures, and victories change the temperature.

---

### 7. Use Symbolic Objects/Actions

* Small gesture = small want (holding a letter, scrolling a feed).
  Big gesture = big want (sending the letter, storming a stage).
  Rituals and objects can “measure” desire on the page.

---

### 8. Physical and Emotional Signals

* **Low:** silence, staring, small talk, drifting.
* **Medium:** risk, confession, argument, visible stress.
* **High:** obsession, meltdown, yelling, ultimatums, burned bridges.

---

### 9. Other Characters Can Turn the Dial

* Allies stoke desire (“Go for it!”), rivals raise the stakes, mentors warn, family guilts.
  Desire always lives in a social ecosystem.

**Questions to Ask as You Write:**

* What does my character want—right now?
* How bad is the burn?
* What would push them to act (or to stop)?
* What stands in their way—and does it matter?
* What’s the real cost if they fail?
* If they win, is it enough—or does a new want show up?

**Dial Examples:**

* *Low → Medium*: Watching from afar → crush leaves soon, so they make a move.
* *Medium → High*: Wants promotion → rival cheats, so risks it all.
* *High → Low*: Obsessed with revenge → lets go, finds peace (or just collapses).

**Bottom line:**
Potency is a dial, not a switch. Scene by scene, you control the heat. If the story stalls, just ask:
**“How badly do they want it—right now? What would turn it up, or cool it down?”**
