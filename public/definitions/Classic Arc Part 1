Ordinary World
You don’t start the story with fireworks. You start with whatever the character calls normal. That might mean safety. That might mean tension held by habit. It might mean a version of themselves they’ve learned to carry without complaint.

The Ordinary World isn’t boring. It’s familiar. That’s the point. It’s the version of life the reader needs to understand so they’ll recognize what’s being risked. You’re showing the stakes—not by announcing them, but by showing what’s settled.

In your life, you’ve had an Ordinary World a hundred times. The job you hated but kept. The relationship you stayed in because it was predictable. The version of yourself you presented to keep everything quiet.

You only see it clearly when it’s behind you.

This part of the story is the lie of stillness. Things aren’t changing—yet. That illusion is what gives the rest of the story contrast. Because change only matters if we know what it’s disturbing.

What It Does in a Story
The Ordinary World gives you a frame. Not just for the plot, but for the character’s inner life. Who are they before the question shows up? Before they get knocked off their axis? Before they start reaching for more—or running from it?

This section gives the reader a sense of gravity. A center. The plot will move outward from here, but if you skip this part—or flatten it—you lose all emotional measurement.

This is where the character’s baseline is established. Not as a stat sheet. As a rhythm. If this part is done well, the rest of the story will feel like disruption, not just escalation. The reader should feel what’s being lost, ignored, escaped, or resisted.

What It Feels Like
Numb but functional

Overworked or under-challenged

Comfortable but shrinking

Rigid, too quiet, or falsely whole

Enclosed by expectation

Low-stakes repetition

This isn’t about sadness. This is about scale. The Ordinary World is too small—or too settled—to hold what’s coming. Sometimes the character knows that. Sometimes they don’t. But the reader should sense it even if nobody says it.

✶ This step is not about happiness or misery. It’s about what is, right now, before the story disrupts it.

Tools You Can Use
These are the literary tools that can shape this part of your story without shouting “Ordinary World” to the reader:

1. Tone
Your voice should mirror the emotional climate of the character. Let the style of your writing carry the emotional posture. Dull can be a tone. Dry can be a tone. Let repetition or brevity show us what “settled” feels like.

2. Setting as Structure
The world should reflect the character’s state—if it’s rigid, let them live in lines and clocks. If it’s stagnant, show stillness. Use weather, space, geography, light, and sound to reinforce the status quo.

3. Motif
This is a good place to introduce the image, phrase, or idea that will echo later. It doesn’t need meaning yet. Just presence. Something that seems unimportant now but will gain weight as the arc continues.

4. Proximity
Who’s near the character? What does their space look like? This device shows us what roles they perform: child, worker, ghost, friend, burden. We don’t need dialogue. Just proximity reveals a lot.

5. Contrast in Action
Start hinting at what’s off—one moment of friction inside the settled routine. A gesture too sharp. A silence too long. One character who sees through it. You’re setting up the break before the break.

Extended Example
Let’s take Ratatouille further.

Remy isn’t a hero yet. He’s a rat in a nest. He respects his father. He follows the rules. He loves flavor, but he hides it. He literally hides—inside walls, under floors, behind others.

The Ordinary World isn’t miserable. It’s survivable. But it flattens him. Every day is a repetition of “don’t be seen, don’t be different, don’t want more.” We see that in how he steals food. In how he moves. In how his talents are framed as risk.

The world isn’t wrong. It’s just wrong for him. That’s the story.

What makes this beat work is that the audience understands his world before it explodes. We see the pressures, the culture, the family logic. So when it does fall apart, we know what he lost and what he never had.

You can do this with any setting—rural, urban, fantastical. It’s not about what genre you’re in. It’s about letting the reader sit in the character’s skin before they’re changed.

Mistakes to Watch For
❌ Starting with Action That Doesn’t Belong
A random chase or explosion just to “hook the reader” often weakens this step. If your action doesn’t grow out of the world itself, it’s noise.

❌ Backstory Dump
Readers don’t need a dossier. They need patterns. Let behavior reveal what kind of world this is. Let setting imply history. Avoid stopping the flow to explain everything.

❌ Making It Too Neutral
This world has a tone. Give it texture. Let it have weight. Don’t just make it “normal”—make it the kind of normal this person knows. That’s what gives your arc uniqueness.

Questions to Ask While Writing
What part of this world feels “final” to the character—even if it’s not?

Who benefits from this character staying exactly who they are?

What would surprise the character if you removed it from their life?

How does their space reflect who they think they are?

What details keep showing up that the character doesn’t seem to notice?

What This Step Says to You
You’ve lived in your own Ordinary Worlds. Sometimes you thought they were all there was. Sometimes you knew they’d have to crack. Maybe you stayed longer than you should have. Maybe you left too soon. Either way, you know this step.

Use that.

Use the feeling of keeping things steady when you know something’s off. Use the sound of a fridge humming in a dark room after everyone leaves. Use the way you dressed when you were pretending to be fine.

You’re not just building a foundation for your character. You’re writing a world someone might still be stuck in.

Treat it with care. Then get ready to break it.

The Ordinary World is set. The character’s life has a rhythm, a shape, a weight—whether it’s comfortable, suffocating, or somewhere in between. You’ve shown the reader what’s normal for them, what they’re holding onto, and what’s holding them in place. Now the story’s waiting for the crack, but it’s not here yet. This phase, the lingering in the Ordinary World, is about deepening the reader’s understanding of the character’s reality so the coming disruption feels personal and inevitable. It’s about making the world feel lived-in, so when the Call to Adventure hits, the stakes are clear.The Function of Lingering in the Ordinary WorldThe Ordinary World’s primary function is to establish the character’s baseline, but the lingering phase—before the Call arrives—serves to solidify that foundation. It’s not just about showing where the character is; it’s about showing why they stay there, what they’re protecting, and what they’re blind to. This phase sets up the emotional and narrative contrast that will make the Call matter. Without it, the Call is just an event; with it, the Call becomes a challenge to everything the character knows.This lingering also builds anticipation. The reader should feel the tension of a world that’s too small, too fragile, or too rigid to last. Even if the character doesn’t see it, the story should hint that something’s coming—a shift, a fracture, a question. This phase is about planting seeds of unease or possibility, so when the Call arrives, it feels like it was always meant to break through.Finally, this phase grounds the story in the character’s personal reality. It’s not enough to say they live in a small town or a bustling city. You need to show how their specific life—their routines, their relationships, their fears—shapes their world. This makes the reader care about what’s at stake when the story starts to move.Practical, Personal, and Specific Ways to Deepen the Ordinary WorldTo make this phase practical and personal, focus on the small, specific details that define the character’s life. These aren’t just background—they’re the texture of their reality. Here’s how to do it:Show a Specific Daily Ritual
Pick one routine that defines the character’s normal and make it vivid. If your character is a librarian who’s stuck in a rut, don’t just say they shelve books. Show them running their fingers along the spines of the same novels every morning, checking for dust, or re-alphabetizing a section they know is already perfect. Maybe they always pause at a specific book they’ve never read but always meant to. This ritual isn’t just a habit—it’s a window into what keeps them tethered to this world.
Highlight a Personal Relationship That Anchors Them
The Ordinary World is shaped by who the character interacts with. Choose one relationship—friend, parent, coworker, neighbor—and show a specific interaction that reveals the dynamic. If your character is a single mom working retail, maybe her teenage son always leaves his dishes in the sink, and she washes them without saying anything, even though it stings. Or maybe her coworker cracks the same tired joke every shift, and she laughs because it’s easier than arguing. These moments show what the character accepts as normal, even if it’s not ideal.
Use a Specific Object as a Touchstone
Give the character something they interact with daily that carries emotional weight. It could be a chipped mug they drink from every morning, a photo they glance at on their desk, or a worn-out pair of shoes they refuse to replace. If your character is a college student, maybe they carry a backpack with a frayed strap their dad fixed with duct tape years ago. Every time they sling it over their shoulder, it’s a reminder of home—and the weight of staying the same. This object grounds the Ordinary World in something tangible.
Show a Specific Flaw or Blind Spot
The character’s not perfect, and the Ordinary World is where their flaws feel safe or invisible. Be specific about what they’re ignoring or justifying. If your character is a freelance coder who avoids confrontation, maybe they let a client shortchange them again, telling themselves it’s not worth the fight. Show them clicking “send” on an invoice they know won’t be paid in full, their jaw tight but silent. This moment reveals what they’re willing to tolerate—and sets up what the Call will challenge.
Plant a Specific Hint of What’s Coming
The Ordinary World should feel stable but not airtight. Drop one small detail that suggests the world isn’t as settled as it seems. If your character is a factory worker, maybe they notice a new machine being installed, but no one explains why. Or they overhear a coworker whispering about layoffs. It’s not the Call yet—just a ripple that makes the reader feel the ground shifting. For the character, it’s a blip they dismiss; for the reader, it’s a signal that change is close.

The Emotional and Narrative WeightLingering in the Ordinary World is about making the character’s life feel real and fragile. The reader should sense that this world, as familiar as it is, can’t hold forever. The character might feel safe, trapped, or somewhere in between, but their emotions should be clear through their actions, not just stated. If they’re a teacher who loves their job but feels unseen, show them grading papers late at night, circling the same mistake on every test, wondering if anyone notices their effort. The weight comes from the gap between what they do and what they feel.This phase also sets up the character’s arc by showing what they’re holding onto. Whether it’s a dream they’ve buried, a fear they avoid, or a role they play, the Ordinary World is where you establish what they’ll have to let go of—or fight for—when the Call arrives. The reader should feel the tension of a life that’s about to be disrupted, even if the character doesn’t see it coming.Examples in ActionIn The Devil Wears Prada, Andy’s Ordinary World is her unglamorous life as a recent grad. She’s in a cramped apartment, eating takeout with her boyfriend, applying for jobs she doesn’t really want. The specific details—her outdated resume, the way she laughs off her boyfriend’s teasing about her ambition—make her world feel lived-in. When the Call (the job at Runway) arrives, we understand what she’s risking: her comfort, her values, her relationships.In a more grounded example, imagine a story about a carpenter in a small town. His Ordinary World is the workshop where he’s worked for 20 years, sanding boards to the same radio station every day. He always eats lunch at the same diner, where the waitress knows his order. But there’s a specific detail: he keeps a sketch of a chair he designed but never built, tucked in a drawer. That sketch, and his habit of glancing at it when he thinks no one’s looking, shows his buried dream—and hints at the Call that might force him to face it.In Mad Max: Fury Road, Furiosa’s Ordinary World is the Citadel, a brutal but structured place. We see her competence, her role as an Imperator, the way she navigates the hierarchy. But there’s a specific moment—her glance at the women she’s transporting—that hints at her unease, her hidden rebellion. It’s subtle but personal, setting up the Call that will push her to act.Mistakes to Avoid Making It Too Generic
A vague “small town” or “busy city” isn’t enough. The Ordinary World needs specific details that tie to the character’s life—a favorite coffee mug, a coworker’s nickname, a street they avoid. Without these, the world feels like a backdrop, not a life. Skipping the Emotional Texture
The Ordinary World isn’t just a setting—it’s a feeling. Don’t just describe the character’s job or house. Show how they feel about it through their actions—a sigh when they lock the door, a pause before they answer a question. This makes the world personal. Overloading with Details
You don’t need to describe every corner of their life. Pick a few specific, meaningful details—a routine, a relationship, an object—and let them carry the weight. Too much detail drowns the reader; too little leaves the world flat.Questions to Ask While WritingWhat’s one specific routine that defines the character’s daily life?
Who or what in their world makes them feel safe—or trapped?
What’s one object they interact with that carries emotional weight?
What’s one flaw or blind spot they don’t see, but the reader does?
What’s one small detail that hints the world is about to change?What This Means for YouYou’ve lived in Ordinary Worlds. The apartment where you stayed too long. The job where you knew every routine by heart. The version of yourself you wore like a uniform, even when it didn’t fit anymore. You know the feeling of a life that’s familiar but heavy—the way you folded laundry to avoid thinking, or the way you kept your keys in the same spot every day, like it would hold everything together.That’s what you’re writing here. The small, specific things that make a life feel real. The way your character checks their phone before bed, or the way they avoid a certain room. The way they smile at someone they don’t like, just to keep the peace. You know those moments because you’ve lived them.Your character’s in that space now. Their world feels solid, but it’s not. Write the details that make it theirs. Write the weight of staying still. Write the life they’re about to lose—or fight for—when the Call comes.
