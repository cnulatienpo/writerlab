PACING PART 1: THE BASICS

What is pacing? It’s the speed and rhythm at which a story unfolds. Pacing controls tension, emotion, and reader engagement.

I. Why Pacing Matters
Pacing shapes the reader’s experience. Fast pacing creates excitement; slow pacing builds suspense or emotion.

II. Types of Pacing
1. Fast: Short sentences, quick scenes, action-heavy.
2. Slow: Long sentences, introspection, detailed description.

III. Pacing in Action
Vary pacing to match story needs. Speed up for action, slow down for emotion or revelation.

IV. Exercise
Write a scene twice: once fast-paced, once slow-paced.
