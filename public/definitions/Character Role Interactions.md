CHARACTER ROLE INTERACTIONS

What are role interactions? They’re the ways characters influence, challenge, and change each other through their roles in the story.

I. Why Role Interactions Matter
Role interactions create conflict, growth, and surprise. They reveal character through action and reaction.

II. Types of Interactions
1. Conflict: Clashing goals or values.
2. Alliance: Working together for a common cause.
3. Betrayal: Broken trust, shifting loyalties.
4. Sacrifice: One character gives up something for another.
5. Revelation: Hidden truths come to light.

III. Interactions in Action
Show how interactions change relationships. Who gains or loses trust? Who learns or grows?

IV. Interaction and Arc
Major interactions should push characters along their arcs—toward growth, regression, or revelation.

V. Exercise
Write a scene where a role interaction changes the course of the story.
