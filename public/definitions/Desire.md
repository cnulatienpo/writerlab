DESIRE

What is desire? It’s the driving force behind every character’s actions. Desire creates goals, conflict, and momentum.

I. Why Desire Matters
Desire makes characters active, not passive. It gives purpose to choices and stakes to conflict.

II. Types of Desire
1. Survival: Stay alive, protect loved ones.
2. Love: Win affection, keep a relationship.
3. Power: Gain control, status, or influence.
4. Justice: Right a wrong, seek revenge.
5. Truth: Uncover secrets, solve mysteries.

III. Desire vs. Need
Desire is what the character wants; need is what they truly require to grow or heal.

IV. Desire in Action
Show desire through pursuit, sacrifice, and risk. What lines will your character cross—or refuse to cross?

V. Exercise
Write a scene where your character’s desire puts them in conflict with another’s. What happens?
