FLAT CHARACTER

What is a flat character? It’s a character who doesn’t change or grow. Flat characters serve a purpose, but aren’t the focus of the story.

I. Why Flat Characters Matter
Flat characters provide contrast, support, or obstacles for dynamic characters. They can be comic relief, mentors, or villains.

II. Flat vs. Dynamic
Flat characters don’t have arcs. They’re defined by a single trait or role.

III. Flat Characters in Action
Use flat characters to highlight the growth of dynamic ones.

IV. Exercise
Write a scene where a flat character’s presence changes the dynamic character’s path.
