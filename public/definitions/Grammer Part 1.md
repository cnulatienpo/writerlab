GRAMMAR PART 1: THE BASICS

What is grammar? It’s the system of rules that govern language—how words combine to create meaning.

I. Why Grammar Matters
Grammar makes writing clear, precise, and powerful. It’s the difference between confusion and communication.

II. The Parts of Speech
1. Noun: Person, place, thing, or idea.
2. Verb: Action or state of being.
3. Adjective: Describes a noun.
4. Adverb: Describes a verb, adjective, or other adverb.
5. Pronoun: Replaces a noun.
6. Preposition: Shows relationship (in, on, under).
7. Conjunction: Connects words or clauses.
8. Interjection: Expresses emotion (wow, ouch).

III. Grammar in Action
Use grammar to create rhythm, emphasis, and style. Break rules for effect, but know them first.

IV. Exercise
Write a sentence using all eight parts of speech.
