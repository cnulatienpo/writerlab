NARRATIVE DEVICES PART 1: THE BASICS

What is a narrative device? It’s a technique or structure used to tell a story—flashbacks, unreliable narrators, frame stories, etc.

I. Why Devices Matter
Devices shape how readers experience the story. They create suspense, surprise, or emotional impact.

II. Common Devices
1. Flashback: A scene set in the past.
2. Foreshadowing: Hints of what’s to come.
3. Unreliable Narrator: A narrator whose version can’t be trusted.
4. Frame Story: A story within a story.
5. Nonlinear Structure: Events out of chronological order.

III. Devices in Action
Use devices to reveal character, theme, or backstory in creative ways.
