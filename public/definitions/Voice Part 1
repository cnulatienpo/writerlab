🩸 WHAT IS VOICE?
Voice is the raw, undeniable energy that happens when you say what only you can say, in a way that only you can say it.

It’s not the words.
It’s the wiring underneath the words.
It’s the system your brain runs on before you censor it, before you dress it up in what’s “good,” “right,” or “marketable.”

It’s not “style.”
Style is what you wear.
Voice is your fucking DNA.

💥 VOICE IS NOT SAFE
Voice is:

Aggressive

Messy

Vulnerable

Petty

Too much

Not enough

Wrong for the assignment

Disrespectful of the rules

That’s why people kill it.
Or hide it.
Or revise it out until what’s left is a workshop Frankenstein with perfect posture and zero soul.

But the greats? They don’t do that.

🧠 WHO HAS A VOICE?
Let’s talk about some loud bastards.

🐍 William S. Burroughs
Voice like: cut-up paranoia, junkie lucidity, insect logic
Burroughs invented the feeling of reality melting in your hand like heroin-slick paper. He wrote like he was decoding transmissions from a broken god. If you read a sentence and it feels like your brain is glitching—that’s voice.

“Language is a virus from outer space.”
That’s not metaphor. That’s his operating system.

🔫 Hunter S. Thompson
Voice like: speed-fueled invective, political bar fight, circus mind
He didn’t “report.” He detonated his presence into every scene. Every line was drenched in his disgust, his ecstasy, his roar against hypocrisy.

“I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me.”

His voice became genre. That’s how strong it was.

🥃 Irvine Welsh
Voice like: acid-rinsed dialect, street-soaked rage, nihilistic poetry
Welsh writes how people actually speak—not just in accent, but in desire. In fuck-ups. In pain. And he never cleans it up. He doesn’t “translate” working-class Scots into literature. He forces literature to crawl to his corner.

“Ah feel that fuckin gid aboot it ah’m gaun tae git masel an injury.”
And you do feel it. Because he believes in the rhythm of his people more than the rules of English.

💣 Henry Rollins
Voice like: vein-popping clarity, righteous obsession, physical truth
Rollins is a body in motion. His writing voice punches. Not because he’s angry, but because he means it. He turns guilt, shame, loneliness, masculinity, and violence into mantras. His voice is a pressure cooker of discipline and inner war.

“No such thing as spare time, no such thing as free time, no such thing as down time. All you got is life time. Go.”

His voice isn’t elegant. It’s honest. It moves.

🎤 WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON?
They all write from inside the experience

They never flatten their perspective to match the market

They use every tool—grammar, rhythm, syntax, punctuation—as expression

They are all unmistakably themselves

They are not just authors.
They are literary weapons.

⚙️ VOICE IS WHAT EVERYTHING ELSE SERVES
You’re learning tools—scene work, structure, dialogue—not to write “better.”
You’re learning tools so you can aim your voice harder.

Want to write emotionally broken characters? Voice gives them breath.
Want to build surreal worlds? Voice tells us what’s real inside them.
Want to scream about injustice, beauty, death, shame, survival? Voice is the fuse.

Everything else is just wiring.
Voice is the voltage.

🧨 YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE
This isn’t about developing a voice.
It’s about stripping away the bullshit that covers it.

You already speak a certain way.

You have rhythm in your rage.

You pause in certain places when you're scared.

You repeat yourself when you’re trying to believe something.

You whisper truths inside your own lies.

That’s voice.
Start noticing it. Start honoring it.

✍️ EXERCISES TO FIND IT (OR FUCKING PROTECT IT)
Write a page where you are completely unlikable.
Don’t soften it. Let your pettiness, lust, boredom, wrath, confusion come out.

Write in your real voice.
The way you talk in your head. Not “writer you.” You.

Write about something you hate so much it feels like fire.
No metaphors. Just truth. Let it burn. Then find the rhythm.

Take a clean paragraph you wrote. Fuck it up.
Add run-ons. Add violence. Add obsession. Add weird grammar. Break it. Now read both. Which one feels alive?

Steal from your heroes. Then go louder.
Pick a Burroughs passage. Mimic it. Now rewrite it in your world, your pain, your meter. Let it mutate.

📛 RULES DON’T MATTER. TRUTH DOES.
The truth is:
You don’t learn to write to follow rules.
You learn to write so you can finally, finally, say the thing that’s been eating you alive.

You don’t need permission.
You don’t need polish.
You need nerve.
You need to trust that your exact voice—with all its chaos, fury, pattern, and stank—is the most valuable thing you have.

So yeah.
Everything else in writing? Just tools.

Voice is the thing you’re here to fucking use them for. build your own literary language.

 VOICE, PART TWO
How to Find It, Use It, and Not Kill It Along the Way
☠️ Part One: The Murder of Voice (Why Most Writers Sound the Same)
Before we build anything, I want to show you the crime scene.

Every writing class you’ve ever taken, every article you’ve ever read, every critique group full of "I like it, but..."—they all taught you to smooth your voice out.

Make it cleaner.
Make it smarter.
Make it “more professional.”
Make it not-you.

That’s how voice dies.

You start censoring yourself line by line. You start swapping your rhythm for theirs. You start writing like you’re apologizing for existing.

Let me say this clearly:

Voice is not a skill to acquire.
It’s a resistance to erasure.

You already have one. You’ve just been taught to bury it.

So our job?
We unbury it.

🧱 Part Two: Voice Is Built on Decisions
Let’s get into the practical side.

Every single choice you make on the page is a voice decision. Not style. Voice.

Let’s take a basic sentence:

The boy walked down the road.

Now let’s run it through a few different voices.

💊 Hunter S. Thompson style

The kid barreled down the dust-slick road like a jailbreaker on speed, muttering to himself, twitching, possibly armed.

👁️ Irvine Welsh style

The wee cunt stumbled doon the road, ripped aff his tits, smirkin like he’d just shagged the Queen.

🦴 Henry Rollins style

Boy. Road. Movement. Get there. Don’t stop. No excuses.

🧠 You, if you’re honest

He walked like he was trying not to think about the last thing she said. He wasn’t good at not thinking.

Each one is telling you:

What matters to this writer

What kind of world we’re in

How thoughts form in the narrator’s head

Your voice shows up in:

What details you include

What you skip

What words you reach for first

How your sentences move

Where you breathe

You don’t need to "find" your voice.
You need to start choosing on purpose.

🧠 Part Three: The Voice Inventory
Let’s build a voice map for you. I want you to answer these for yourself—not with the “right” answer. Just say what’s real.

What pisses you off so bad you can’t stay quiet?

What do you think everyone is pretending not to see?

What does shame feel like in your body?

What’s the realest sentence you’ve ever written? (Even if it’s not good.)

When you tell stories out loud, what parts do you rush? What parts do you linger on?

When you read your old stuff, what sentences make you go: "fuck yeah that’s me"?

Write these down.
This is your fuel.
This is what your voice burns on.

🎯 Part Four: Get Specific or Die
Here’s what every beginner gets wrong: they write in generalizations.
But real voice lives in the specific. Not in metaphors, not in genre, not in abstraction.

Watch:

She was angry.
(That’s not voice. That’s a billboard.)

She wanted to kick through the drywall until her toes bled, but her mother was watching.
(Now we’re getting somewhere.)

She stared at the tiny crack in the windowsill paint and thought, “If I scream now, I’ll never stop.”
(That’s voice. That’s interior truth.)

If you want your voice to show up, you have to stop summarizing your feelings and start writing them from inside the skin.

🧪 Part Five: Experiments That Will Scare You (Good)
Alright, time to do something.
Here’s a series of writing experiments to crack your voice wide open.

🔨 1. Write One Page Without Looking Back
Set a timer: 10 minutes

Pick any moment in your life or a scene you’ve imagined

Write it fast. No line edits. No deleting.

Let your instincts run the page.

Then read it back. Ask:

What words did I repeat?

Where did I get loud? Quiet?

Where did I flinch?

That's the raw stuff. That’s you.

🥀 2. Write the Page You’re Ashamed to Write
The one about:

The thing you never told anyone

The thing that still hurts when you think about it

The part of you that doesn’t fit in the “writer” box

Now don’t make it beautiful.
Make it true. Voice doesn’t come from good writing. It comes from real wiring.

🧱 3. Write a Monologue You’d Never Say Out Loud
Make a character say:

What you believe about love but are scared to admit

What you believe about violence, about justice, about men, about family, about death

Use your words, your patterns, your rhythm.

No filler. Just straight blood.

📡 4. Steal a Sentence, Break It, Make It Yours
Take this:

“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money…”

Now rewrite it in your own language.
Example:

Those two motherfuckers never cleaned up their own mess. Just left shit broken and lit another cigar.

See what I mean?
Voice is how you say it—not how smart it sounds.

🧠 Part Six: Patterns That Might Be Yours
Let me give you a cheat sheet. These are the kinds of voice traits I’ve seen in raw, powerful writers like you. You don’t need to “pick” one—you probably have two or three mixed together.

1. The Bare-Knuckle Voice
Short, clipped. Angry even when it’s calm. Says exactly what it means, then shuts up.
Examples: Henry Rollins, Raymond Carver, Denis Johnson

“He left. She didn’t stop him. The room got smaller.”

2. The Viscera Voice
Long, emotional, flooded with detail. Goes deep, stays deep.
Examples: Sylvia Plath, Ocean Vuong, Faulkner

“She wept into the smell of bleach and plastic—the room too white, her throat too sore to scream.”

3. The Street Prophet Voice
Rhythmic, furious, smart as hell but doesn’t give a fuck if you think so.
Examples: Irvine Welsh, James Baldwin, June Jordan, Kathy Acker

“I told them the system was broke but they thought I meant the vending machine.”

4. The Ritual Voice
Symbol-heavy. Repetitive. Like a prayer or a curse.
Examples: Clarice Lispector, Cormac McCarthy, Anne Carson

“He dreamed of blood. He dreamed of light. He dreamed of the end, again.”

5. The Comic Mask Voice
Jokes on the surface, horror underneath. Protects the wound by laughing.
Examples: Lorrie Moore, Kurt Vonnegut, Paul Beatty

“I didn’t cry at the funeral. I mean, it wasn’t my favorite cousin.”

Which ones feel like home?
Which ones make you say: I didn’t know I was allowed to write like that?

That’s your voice talking back.

🛠️ Part Seven: Using Tools Without Losing Your Self
Let’s say you start learning structure. Or pacing. Or worldbuilding.
Here’s the danger: you start shaping your work to fit the tool, instead of using the tool to fit your voice.

So here’s the fix.

Any time you learn a writing skill, ask:

How does this amplify what I already do?

How would I break this rule on purpose?

If I do it my way, does it still work?

Example:

A traditional scene opens with a setting, then introduces conflict.

Your voice might not care about location. It might start with a scream, a smell, or a lie.

Cool.
Do that.

Then tuck the setting in later, when the reader is already bleeding with you.

That’s using craft in service of voice.

Not the other way around.

🎇 Part Eight: Voice Is a Practice, Not a Product
You’re never “done” finding your voice.
You’re just getting closer to the parts of yourself you were told to shut up.

It’s not a brand.
It’s not a style guide.
It’s a living, shifting language that grows as you do.

Write enough and it will start showing up even when you’re tired.
Even when you’re afraid.
Especially when you’ve got nothing left but the truth.

✊ Part Nine: Final Reminders
Your voice will sound “wrong” at first. That’s how you know it’s real.

Someone will always tell you to tone it down. Don’t.

Someone will say “but who wants to read that?” Ignore them.

If a sentence makes you nervous, it’s probably alive.

Your job isn’t to be understood. It’s to be unmistakable.

And look—
I know you’re doing this alone.
But you’re not alone in doing it.

People like you—the ones who can’t stand to fake it anymore—they’re the ones who change what writing is.

So fuck the workshop version.
Fuck the safe draft.
Give us the voice you were born with, before anyone tried to shame it out of you.

Then write until it rips the page open.


# finding your voice 

## 🌪 Step One: What Reality *Feels* Like to You

This is the ground floor. Before plot, before character, before scene. This is you. Raw.

Every story is built on a reality. But not the kind you find in a newspaper. The kind that lives *under your skin.* Your job is not to mirror the world back as it appears. Your job is to tell us how it *feels* to be alive inside your mind.

Magical realism said: "This is what poverty and grief and memory feel like in Colombia."

What does *your* world feel like?

When you're not trying to explain yourself to outsiders?
When you're not translating?
When you're dreaming?
When you're dissociating?
When you're spiraling?

**This is your emotional physics.**

Not rules of plot. Rules of perception.

### Write it out:

Don't give me story ideas. Give me *feelings, patterns, truths* that live in your bones.

Examples:

* "Time never moves forward. It folds and returns."
* "People vanish even when they’re right in front of you."
* "Every kindness is paid for in blood."
* "God is language. And He’s gone."
* "Memory doesn't exist until someone else mentions it."
* "Nothing is real until you leave it behind."
* "Pain becomes architecture. It builds the rooms you live in."

These are not metaphors. These are **operating systems.**
They tell us how your universe functions. What can and can’t happen. What things mean when no one's pretending.

This is the soil your genre will grow in. Write 10. Then 10 more. Don’t analyze. Just dump them. They can be abstract or concrete. Personal or mythic.

**They are your truth. That’s what makes them sacred.**

---

## 🔥 Step Two: Write What Other Genres *Can’t* Hold

Most genres are boxes. Useful boxes. But still boxes. They make assumptions about what kind of story is being told, who gets to speak, and what counts as truth.

But your story—if you’re being real—*leaks.*
It doesn’t fit inside the normal walls. It spills.

Ask yourself:

* Where does horror fall short? Does it let you grieve?
* Where does drama feel fake? Does it sanitize the violence?
* Where does memoir feel dead? Does it erase the dream logic?
* Where does realism fail? Does it ignore the way pain distorts perception?

If you’ve ever written a scene and thought, “This doesn’t belong anywhere,” *good.* That means it belongs to you.

### Exercises:

1. **Make a list of scenes that broke the form.**

   * Things you wrote that felt too weird, too raw, too unfilmable.
   * Scenes where the emotion was real, but the structure betrayed it.

2. **Write a scene that would get you kicked out of a writing workshop.**

   * Too long. Too short. No arc. All repetition. All silence. No tidy ending.

3. **Write the moment that realism can’t handle.**

   * Maybe someone dies, but no one reacts. Maybe God walks in wearing a hoodie. Maybe time stops. Maybe nothing happens and *that* is the horror.

Those scenes? That’s the birth of a new form.
That’s heat. That’s what your genre will hold.

---

## 🧱 Step Three: Build Recurring Tools (Symbols, Moves, Mechanics)

Once you know what reality feels like to you, and what existing genres can’t hold, it’s time to build your *toolkit.*

Genres don’t just have vibes. They have **repeatable techniques** you can use again and again to create meaning.

Start tracking your own:

### 1. **Symbols**

What images or objects show up over and over in your work?

* Crows?
* Bathrooms?
* Neon lights?
* Dying animals?
* Unread letters?
* Clothing left behind?
* Broken glass?

These aren’t decorations. These are your *verbs.* They do the emotional lifting.

### 2. **Narrative Moves**

What structural patterns feel natural to you?

* Do you start with silence?
* Do you loop time?
* Do you switch POV mid-sentence?
* Do you avoid dialogue because it's all a lie?
* Do you interrupt every scene with memory, sound, religion?

Every time you write something that feels *right,* write down what you just did.
That’s your **native form.**

### 3. **Core Tension**

Every writer has one primary wound they write around. One friction that powers the voice.

What’s yours?

* Truth vs Power?
* Belonging vs Erasure?
* Order vs Chaos?
* Faith vs Doubt?
* Visibility vs Safety?
* Intimacy vs Violence?

Your genre is going to stage this war over and over, using different masks.

### 4. **Mechanics**

These are the craft choices that you return to like muscle memory.

* Long run-on sentences that never breathe
* Sentences that *snap*
* Paragraphs that feel like spirals
* Repetition as ritual
* Lists instead of dialogue
* Second person when you’re most afraid

Collect these. Use them like spells.

**These are your genre’s building blocks.**
When someone reads five different things you’ve written and starts to notice the same emotional weather, the same narrative tricks, the same haunted images?

You didn’t just write stories.

> You built a language.

---

## ⚖️ Keep Going

Your job is not to invent something completely new.
Your job is to be *so relentlessly yourself* on the page that the shape of your voice becomes its own architecture.

That’s what genre really is:

> A set of **repeatable artistic laws** that express a particular **emotional reality.**

Start small.
Write from your real perception.
Notice what recurs.
Name nothing yet.
Keep going.

And when it starts to feel like *your stories are obeying rules no one else understands?*

That means you’re getting close.
