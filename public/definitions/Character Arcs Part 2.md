CHARACTER ARCS PART 2: DEEPENING THE ARC

I. The Role of Relationships
No character changes in a vacuum. Relationships are the crucible for transformation. Allies, mentors, antagonists, and love interests all force the character to confront their flaws and beliefs.

II. The Mirror Character
Introduce a character who reflects the protagonist’s flaw or opposite trait. Their interactions highlight what the protagonist must change (or risk becoming).

III. The Shadow
The shadow is the dark path the protagonist could take. It’s the embodiment of their worst impulses or the consequences of refusing to change.

IV. The Arc’s Impact on Plot
The character’s internal journey should drive external events. Their choices, shaped by their arc, create the story’s turning points.

V. Subverting the Arc
Sometimes, the most powerful arcs are those that defy expectations. A character might regress, remain unchanged, or change in unexpected ways.

VI. Exercise
Write a scene where your protagonist faces their shadow. How do they react? What does it reveal about their arc?
