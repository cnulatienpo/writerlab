DYNAMIC CHARACTERS

What is a dynamic character? It’s a character who changes over the course of the story. Dynamic characters grow, regress, or transform.

I. Why Dynamic Characters Matter
Change is the heart of story. Dynamic characters keep readers invested and make arcs meaningful.

II. Types of Change
1. Growth: Overcoming flaws, learning lessons.
2. Regression: Succumbing to flaws, losing hope.
3. Transformation: Becoming someone new, for better or worse.

III. Dynamic vs. Static
Dynamic characters change; static characters stay the same. Both have a place, but dynamic arcs drive most stories.

IV. Dynamic Arcs in Action
Show change through choices, relationships, and consequences. What triggers the transformation?

V. Exercise
Map your protagonist’s change. What causes it? What’s the result?
