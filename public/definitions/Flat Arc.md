FLAT ARC

What is a flat arc? It’s a character arc where the protagonist doesn’t change, but changes the world around them. Their core belief is tested, but remains intact.

I. Why Flat Arcs Matter
Not all stories are about transformation. Sometimes, the hero’s strength is their steadfastness.

II. Flat Arc in Action
The protagonist’s truth challenges others’ lies. They inspire, heal, or disrupt the world.

III. Flat vs. Dynamic Arcs
Flat arcs are rare, but powerful. They work best when the world, not the hero, needs to change.

IV. Exercise
Write a scene where your protagonist’s belief changes someone else.
