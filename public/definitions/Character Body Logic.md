CHARACTER BODY LOGIC

What is body logic? It’s the way a character’s physicality reveals their inner world. How they move, react, and inhabit space tells us as much as their words.

I. Why Body Logic Matters
Readers believe what they see. A character’s posture, gestures, and habits are windows into their psyche.

II. The Body-Mind Connection
Emotions manifest physically. Fear tightens muscles, joy loosens them. Show the body’s response to internal states.

III. Signature Gestures
Give each character a unique physical habit—a nervous tic, a confident stride, a way of fiddling with objects.

IV. Action as Subtext
Sometimes, what a character does says more than what they say. Use body language to convey subtext and tension.

V. Exercise
Describe your character entering a room. What does their body reveal that their words don’t?
