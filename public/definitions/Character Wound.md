CHARACTER WOUND

What is a wound? It’s the deep emotional hurt that shapes your character’s fears, flaws, and choices. The wound is the ghost that haunts them.

I. Why Wounds Matter
Wounds create vulnerability and drive arcs. They explain why characters act, react, and resist change.

II. Types of Wounds
1. Loss: Death, abandonment, or betrayal.
2. Trauma: Abuse, violence, or disaster.
3. Shame: Humiliation, failure, or rejection.
4. Guilt: Regret over past actions.
5. Injustice: Being wronged or oppressed.

III. Wound in Action
Show wounds through flashbacks, triggers, or self-sabotage. How does the wound shape the character’s present?

IV. Healing the Wound
The arc is often about facing and healing the wound—or failing to.

V. Exercise
Write a scene where your character’s wound is exposed. How do they cope?
