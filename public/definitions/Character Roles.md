CHARACTER ROLES

What are character roles? They’re the functions characters serve in the story—protagonist, antagonist, mentor, sidekick, etc.

I. Why Roles Matter
Roles create structure and expectation. They help readers understand each character’s place in the story.

II. Common Roles
1. Protagonist: The main character, drives the story.
2. Antagonist: Opposes the protagonist, creates conflict.
3. Mentor: Guides the protagonist, offers wisdom.
4. Sidekick: Supports the protagonist, adds depth.
5. Love Interest: Creates romantic tension or stakes.

III. Subverting Roles
Twist expectations by flipping roles. The mentor betrays, the sidekick saves the day, the antagonist becomes an ally.

IV. Roles and Arcs
Roles can change as characters grow. A sidekick may become a leader; an antagonist may seek redemption.

V. Exercise
Assign roles to your main cast. How do their roles evolve over the story?
