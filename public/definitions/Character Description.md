CHARACTER DESCRIPTION

What is character description? It’s how you paint a vivid, memorable image of your character in the reader’s mind. But it’s more than just hair color and height—it’s about revealing personality, status, and story through detail.

I. Why Description Matters
Readers want to see, hear, and feel your characters. Description grounds them in the world and makes them real.

II. The Three Layers of Description
1. Physical: Height, build, features, clothing.
2. Behavioral: Gestures, habits, posture.
3. Psychological: What their appearance reveals about their inner world.

III. Avoiding Cliché
Skip generic details ("She had blue eyes"). Focus on what’s unique, telling, or surprising.

IV. Description in Action
Show character through action. How do they move, react, or interact with their environment?

V. Exercise
Describe your character meeting someone for the first time. What details stand out? What do they reveal?
