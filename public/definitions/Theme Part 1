PART ONE: What Is Theme?
There are two kinds of writers. Not personality types. Not genres. Just this:

Theme-First Writers and Theme-Discovery Writers.

Theme-First Writers:
“I write because I need to say this.”

They’ve got something burning a hole in their gut. A thesis. A wound. A belief that’s too big to fit in a single sentence. It might sound like:

“People don’t care until it happens to them.”

“Power always corrupts.”

“I want to show what it’s like to survive with dignity when nobody wants you to.”

Theme-first writers begin with an itch to prove something, or at least hold it up to the light. They’re not always sure of the whole story yet—but the reason to write is already alive. They don’t necessarily know the ending, but they know the why.

Theme-Discovery Writers:
“I write to figure out what the hell I’m trying to say.”

They don’t start with a thesis. They start with a situation, a character, a feeling, or a mess. They chase tension, images, scenes that make their skin crawl or their chest hurt. They trust that meaning will emerge if they stay close to what feels real. These writers often uncover their theme by accident—halfway through the draft, or even after the first revision. They look back and realize, oh. This was always about X.

They aren’t wrong for not knowing upfront. They’re usually deeper than they seem. Theme-discovery writing often feels more human, more raw, because it wasn’t filtered through a message. It became one.

Is one better?
No. They serve different gods. Theme-first writing is driven by conviction; it builds like an argument or an elegy. Theme-discovery writing is driven by curiosity; it unfolds like a secret.

But they land in the same place: Theme is what your story means. Not the plot. Not the pitch. The meaning.

So whether you knew it before you wrote the first line or not until your third draft—theme is there. The only question is: will you shape it, or let it shape you?

What Theme Is Not
Let’s kill a few misconceptions real quick.

Theme is not a moral of the story.
It’s not “the lesson.” This isn’t a fable. Stories aren’t after-school specials unless you write them like one.

Theme is not a one-liner.
You can’t slap “betrayal” or “grief” on your manuscript and say you’re done. That’s a topic. A word. Theme needs tension. It’s what you’re doing with grief. What you’re saying through betrayal.

Theme is not something you tack on after.
Even if you discover it late, theme was always there—it just hadn’t been named yet. Trying to “add theme” like spice on a bland dish is a good way to end up with bullshit.

So if it’s not a lesson, not a topic, not an afterthought…
What is it?

Theme Is an Anchor
Theme isn’t just what you say. It’s what grounds the story.

Good stories wander. That’s fine. But great stories return. No matter how many characters or subplots or set pieces—if the story keeps snapping back to something, that’s your theme.

It’s the weight that holds the story down so it doesn’t float off and lose meaning.

But here’s the trick: theme doesn’t always come in one shape. Most writers work with a mix of anchors, even if they don’t realize it. Some are emotional. Some are philosophical. Some are ethical. Some come from pain. Some come from rage. Some are spiritual, even if you don’t believe in anything.

Let’s break it down. Most themes fall into at least one of these three types:

1. Emotional Theme – The Feeling You Can’t Shake
This is the gut-level theme. The ache. The itch. It’s not an argument—it’s a question or confession.

Examples:

“What if love isn’t enough?”

“I miss my brother.”

“I still don’t understand why they left.”

“What does it mean to be seen?”

It might show up in dialogue, sure—but it also lives in the atmosphere of the piece. Emotional theme is the vibe you keep returning to, even when the scene changes. It’s in the silences. The patterns. The look on someone’s face when they almost say what they mean and don’t.

How to know if you’re working with an emotional theme:
You can’t stop writing about a certain kind of feeling or relationship.

The best parts of your draft are soaked in longing, anger, or confusion—but you don’t have a moral to attach to it yet.

When you describe your story to a friend, you say things like, “It’s about feeling trapped,” or “It’s about wanting to go home but not knowing where that is anymore.”

This theme is emotional truth, not intellectual clarity. It’s not neat. It’s not resolved. And that’s exactly why it works.

2. Philosophical Theme – The Argument You’re Making
This is the version of theme most people are familiar with: the claim. The belief. The statement the story is making about life.

Examples:

“Power always corrupts.”

“Violence never truly solves anything.”

“We become what we pretend to be.”

“Mercy is stronger than revenge.”

Philosophical themes don’t have to be preachy, but they are positions. They emerge through contrast. A story about mercy means nothing unless there’s cruelty to compare it to. A story about freedom has to show you cages.

You can arrive at this theme in two ways:

Build the story to prove the point (theme-first), or

Let the point emerge from the story you’re telling (theme-discovery).

Either way, the philosophical theme gives your story spine. It lets your reader argue with the work—or nod in agreement.

It turns your story into a conversation with the world.

3. Moral Dilemma / Meaning Crisis – The Impossible Question
This is where things get heavy.

This anchor isn’t about feeling or philosophy. It’s about collision. Something in the story can’t be answered cleanly. That’s the whole point. This type of theme thrives on contradiction. It asks: What’s the right thing to do when everything’s wrong?

Examples:

“Is it worse to be alone, or to belong to something you hate?”

“If I can’t stop the harm, am I complicit?”

“Is it possible to be good in a corrupt system?”

“What does justice look like when you’ve already survived the worst?”

This kind of theme is foundational for tragedy, necessary for moral fiction, and powerful for character-driven drama.

When you’re working with this kind of anchor, you’re not offering a solution. You’re setting the stage for confrontation—with the world, with other characters, or with the self.

Signs this is your theme anchor:
The protagonist is forced to choose between two bad options.

Your story keeps circling a hard question with no clean answer.

The ending isn’t satisfying because it resolves the question—but because it respects it.

This type of theme leaves readers chewing glass in a good way. It haunts. It lingers. It doesn’t hand you a key; it shows you the locked door.

Most Stories Mix These
You don’t have to pick one anchor and ignore the others. That’s not how it works.

You might start with a moral dilemma, but discover it’s driven by a deeper emotional truth. Or maybe your story starts as an emotional portrait, but eventually crystallizes into a hard philosophical stance. You might layer all three.

Example:

The Godfather

Emotional Theme: Family matters more than anything.

Philosophical Theme: Power isolates and corrupts.

Moral Dilemma: Can loyalty to family justify becoming a monster?

Example:

Everything Everywhere All At Once

Emotional Theme: I miss you. I wish I’d known you better.

Philosophical Theme: Nothing matters—so we choose what does.

Moral Dilemma: How do you protect someone’s future when they want to disappear?

Most stories worth telling are layered like this. They’re not about a single message—they’re built around clashing truths. That’s why they work.

How Theme Shapes the Story
Theme isn't just background noise. It moves things.

Here’s how a strong theme reshapes the entire structure:

Story Element	With No Theme	With a Clear Theme
Characters	Just doing stuff	Choices echo the central tension
Plot	A string of events	Events test or reveal the story’s core question
Tone	Inconsistent or flat	Carries a specific emotional undercurrent
Ending	Arbitrary or abrupt	Feels inevitable, even if unexpected
Dialogue	Filler or generic	Reveals philosophy, emotion, or tension

Theme is what makes your story feel cohesive instead of just long. It’s what gives scenes weight. Even small moments can land hard if they’re resonating against something bigger.

What If You Don’t Know Your Theme?
That’s not a problem. But it is a responsibility.

If you don’t know your theme, you still need to stay alert for it. Look for what keeps repeating. Look for what you don’t want to admit the story is about. Ask:

What do I keep returning to?

What parts feel the most alive or uncomfortable?

What contradiction is my story refusing to resolve?

You don’t need to pin it down in the first draft. But if you’re moving into revision and still don’t know what your story means, then you’re just polishing a mirror with no reflection in it.

You don’t need a theme to start. But you do need one to finish.

In Summary (But Not the TED Talk Kind)
Theme-first writers come in hot with something to say.

Theme-discovery writers come in open, and find it along the way.

Theme is what your story means, not just what happens.

The three biggest types of thematic anchors are:

Emotional (“I miss you.”)

Philosophical (“This is what I believe.”)

Moral/Existential (“There’s no clean answer.”)

Most great stories use all three.

Theme shows up in how your characters act, how your story ends, what scenes you choose, and what lingers.

You can’t fake it. But you also don’t have to force it.

All you have to do… is notice what your story is really doing.
Then decide if you want to lean in, sharpen it, or let it haunt you a little longer.
