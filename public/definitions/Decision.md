DECISION

What is a decision? It’s the moment a character chooses a path, risk, or belief. Decisions reveal character, drive plot, and create consequences.

I. Why Decisions Matter
Every story turns on decisions. They create forks in the road, escalate conflict, and shape arcs.

II. Types of Decisions
1. Moral: Right vs. wrong, loyalty vs. betrayal.
2. Strategic: Risk vs. reward, action vs. inaction.
3. Emotional: Heart vs. head, desire vs. duty.

III. Decision in Action
Show decisions in high-stakes moments. What’s at risk? What does the choice cost?

IV. Regret and Reversal
Characters may regret, reverse, or double down on decisions. This creates complexity and realism.

V. Exercise
Write a scene where your character faces a tough decision. What do they choose? Why?
