DIALOGUE PART 2: ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

I. Subtext
The best dialogue is layered. What’s left unsaid is as important as what’s spoken.

II. Voice
Each character should sound unique. Word choice, rhythm, and slang reveal personality.

III. Conflict in Dialogue

V. Exercise
Write a scene where the real meaning is hidden beneath the words.
