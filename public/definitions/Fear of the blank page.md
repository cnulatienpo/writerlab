FEAR OF THE BLANK PAGE

What is blank page fear? It’s the anxiety, doubt, or paralysis that strikes when you face an empty page. Every writer knows it.

I. Why It Happens
Perfectionism, fear of failure, or overwhelm. The pressure to "get it right" can freeze creativity.

II. How to Beat It
1. Lower the bar: Write badly on purpose. You can fix it later.
2. Set a timer: Write for 10 minutes, no stopping.
3. Start in the middle: Skip the beginning if it’s too daunting.
4. Use prompts: Jumpstart ideas with questions or images.
5. Rituals: Music, candles, or a favorite pen can signal "it’s time."

III. The Power of Momentum
Action beats anxiety. Once you start, the fear fades.

IV. Exercise
Write a page of nonsense. The only rule: don’t stop.
