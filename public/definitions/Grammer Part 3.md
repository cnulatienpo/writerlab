GRAMMAR PART 3: STYLE AND VOICE

I. Style
Style is how you use grammar, word choice, and rhythm to create a unique voice.

II. Voice
Voice is the personality of your writing. It’s shaped by sentence length, word choice, and punctuation.

III. Breaking the Rules
Great writers bend or break grammar rules for effect. Fragments, run-ons, and unusual punctuation can create mood or emphasis.

IV. Consistency
Be consistent in tense, point of view, and style. Inconsistency confuses readers.

V. Exercise
Write a paragraph in your protagonist’s voice. Break one grammar rule for effect.
