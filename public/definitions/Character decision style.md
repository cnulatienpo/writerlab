CHARACTER DECISION STYLE

What is decision style? Itâ€™s the unique way a character approaches choices, risks, and dilemmas. Decision style reveals personality, values, and even hidden fears.

I. Why Decision Style Matters
Every choice is a window into character. Do they leap before they look? Overthink? Seek advice? Avoid decisions? The pattern is as telling as the decision itself.

II. Types of Decision Styles
1. The Impulsive: Acts on gut instinct, often regrets later.
2. The Analyst: Weighs every option, risks paralysis.
3. The Delegator: Lets others decide, avoids responsibility.
4. The Contrarian: Chooses the unexpected, rebels against norms.
5. The Avoider: Dodges decisions, lets fate or others decide.

III. Decision Style in Action
Show decision style in high-stakes moments. Does your character freeze, act rashly, or consult a mentor? How do they handle regret?

IV. Evolving Decision Styles
Arcs can shift decision style. A fearful avoider may become decisive; an impulsive risk-taker may learn caution.

V. Exercise
Write a scene where your character faces a tough choice. How does their decision style shape the outcome?
