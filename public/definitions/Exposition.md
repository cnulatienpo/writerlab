EXPOSITION

What is exposition? It’s the delivery of background information—about the world, characters, or situation—needed to understand the story.

I. Why Exposition Matters
Exposition grounds readers in the story’s reality. It provides context, stakes, and meaning.

II. Types of Exposition
1. Direct: Narration, description, or summary.
2. Indirect: Revealed through dialogue, action, or subtext.

III. Exposition in Action
Show, don’t tell. Weave exposition into scenes, not info-dumps.

IV. The Exposition Trap
Too much exposition slows pace and bores readers. Reveal only what’s necessary, when it’s needed.

V. Exercise
Write a scene that delivers exposition through action or dialogue, not narration.
