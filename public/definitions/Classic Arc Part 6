Tests, Allies, Enemies
Now that the threshold’s been crossed, the story doesn’t wait politely. It reacts.

This is where the protagonist enters the second world in full. No more warm-up. No more theoreticals. This is when things start to happen. Fast, sharp, messy, confusing, revealing. They’re in it now.

The second world isn’t always literal. It might be a new town, a new job, a relationship, a war zone, a dream, a secret, a shift in the self. Whatever it is, it’s structured differently than what came before. It doesn’t play by the rules the character is used to.

This stage is about orientation through chaos. The protagonist doesn’t know how this new world works yet—but they’re about to find out the hard way.

What It Does in a Story
This part builds muscle. It tests reflexes. It develops rhythm. It gives the protagonist room to make mistakes, take hits, form bonds, and notice cracks in everything they assumed.

The stakes aren’t at their peak yet—but they’re real now.

This is also where secondary characters start to show their function. People the protagonist meets aren’t just extras—they’re mirrors, foils, teachers, liars, defenders, tools, traps. How your character reacts to these people helps define who they are becoming.

Every event in this section teaches the character something—even if they don’t understand it yet.

It’s not about the lesson being clear. It’s about the pressure being undeniable.

What It Feels Like
Trying to fake it and getting caught

Reading a room wrong

Meeting someone and instantly knowing: I need them

Losing something and not knowing how much it matters yet

Misjudging an ally

Trusting an enemy

Touching something you shouldn’t have

Realizing no one’s going to explain the rules

This isn’t the moment for total failure or total victory. This is friction. This is the first time the character’s new self gets scuffed up.

It should feel overwhelming—but survivable.

Tools You Can Use
1. Short, Tense Scenes
You can pack a lot of character work into compressed moments. Fights. Interviews. Tasks. Conversations that don’t go as planned. Let these scenes be pointed. Start late. End early.

2. Foil Characters
Introduce someone who reflects a different version of your protagonist. They might be who the protagonist could become—or someone they used to be. Their presence throws things into sharp relief.

3. First Betrayal or First Loyalty
Let someone surprise the protagonist. Show that relationships in this world aren’t predictable. This begins to erode the character’s sense of control.

4. Skill vs. Instinct
Force the character to rely on instinct, because their old skills don’t work here. Or let them use a new skill they didn’t know they had. Either way, let their identity bend.

5. Embedded Rules
This world has codes, hierarchies, social expectations. Let the protagonist break one by accident. Let them pay for it. That tells us more than exposition ever could.

Literary Devices That Work Here
✦ Irony
Let the protagonist make a choice they believe is right—and have it go wrong. This builds tension and character growth without lecturing.

✦ Dialogue as Conflict
Don’t explain the new world. Talk through it. Let characters argue, correct, dismiss, manipulate, or teach the protagonist in real time.

✦ Symbolism through Repetition
Introduce a small object, phrase, gesture, or ritual that keeps coming back with changed meaning. This anchors the world and signals evolution.

✦ Tone Play
If the story has been heavy, inject some absurdity. If it’s been quiet, insert a burst of chaos. The second world should feel different.

Extended Examples
In Mad Max: Fury Road, this stage begins when Furiosa and Max must co-exist in motion. They’re not allies yet. They don’t trust each other. They fight. They test each other. But they start to function. Max earns the rig. Furiosa watches his choices. Every test matters.

In The Hunger Games, Katniss enters the Capitol—that’s the second world. The colors, the training center, the tributes, the rules of the game. She meets allies (Rue, Peeta). She misjudges Haymitch. She learns who watches her. Nothing is safe, but it’s all structured. This section teaches her how to play—and what it’ll cost.

In Finding Nemo, Marlin hits the second world when he leaves the reef. His tests are constant: jellyfish, sharks, forgetting how to breathe, Dory. Every new face challenges his control. Every small win destabilizes his assumptions.

In Euphoria, Rue’s second world is sobriety. Her tests? Every moment of honesty. Every lie. Every person she used to manipulate now becoming her mirror. She keeps failing—but that’s the shape of this section.

You get the point. The new world has claws, but it also offers possibility. That’s what makes this part dynamic.

Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Turning this into a montage
Yes, a fast pace can work—but don’t just breeze through a bunch of stuff happening. The tests must reveal something—they’re not filler. Don’t write scenes that could be skipped without losing emotional traction.

❌ Giving away the endgame
Don’t let allies or enemies spell everything out. Keep the world unpredictable. Characters should withhold, lie, protect themselves. The protagonist is learning through experience, not lectures.

❌ Flattening characters into roles
Your “ally” doesn’t have to be loyal. Your “enemy” doesn’t have to be evil. Complexity here makes the middle act worth reading. Let people change.

Questions to Ask While Writing
What does this new world reward? What does it punish?

Who challenges the protagonist without meaning to?

What does the protagonist assume about others—and how is it wrong?

What does their first real win cost them?

What do they refuse to learn even though it’s now obvious?

Who do they wish they could trust—but can’t?

Variants and Structural Notes
❖ “New Squad” Structure
The protagonist meets a team. There’s tension, rivalry, laughter, chemistry. It’s not a family—but it might become one. Think Guardians of the Galaxy, Pitch Perfect, Inception.

❖ “Falling Upward”
Things go suspiciously well at first. They win something too easily. Gain approval. This lulls the protagonist into overconfidence—then breaks it. Think The Devil Wears Prada, Whiplash, Mean Girls.

❖ “Outnumbered”
The character is one of few (or alone) in the new world. Everyone else speaks a different language, literally or socially. They’re isolated—but watching carefully. Think Lost in Translation, Arrival, District 9.

❖ “False Ally”
Someone helps. Someone teaches. But it’s not real. Their motives are corrupt, conditional, or selfish. The betrayal won’t come until later—but the seeds start here. Think The Prestige, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Gone Girl.

What This Step Says to You
You’ve lived through this part. The part after you crossed a line—and had to figure out how the new world worked.

Maybe it was a job. A breakup. A city. Sobriety. Grief. Coming out. Getting pulled in. Getting out.

You didn’t know the rules. You tested people and got burned. You trusted the wrong one. Or the right one. Or nobody.

You were a mess. But you moved.

That’s what this section is. It’s not clarity. It’s motion. It’s watching yourself adapt before you’ve even accepted that you’re here.

Write that. Write the awkwardness, the anger, the hope you don’t want to admit is building.

This isn’t the hero being heroic.

It’s the character getting scuffed.

Which means it’s alive.

The character’s in the new world now, past the threshold, and there’s no easing them into it. The Tests, Allies, Enemies phase is raw, unpredictable, and relentless—it’s where the story starts to carve the character into something new. They’re not just reacting anymore; they’re being shaped by the world’s pressure, its people, and their own choices. This phase isn’t about resolution—it’s about friction, growth, and discovery. You’ve shown the reader the stakes; now you’re showing how the character handles them when the rules are unclear and the ground keeps shifting.The Function of Tests, Allies, EnemiesThis phase’s primary function is to test the character’s adaptability and reveal who they are under pressure. The new world isn’t a passive backdrop—it’s a crucible. Every test, every interaction with an ally or enemy, forces the character to confront their assumptions, skills, and flaws. This is where their old self starts to fray, and the reader sees glimpses of who they might become. It’s not about winning or losing yet—it’s about learning the cost of surviving in this world.The phase also builds the story’s relationships and conflicts. Allies and enemies aren’t just plot devices; they’re mirrors that reflect the character’s strengths, weaknesses, or potential. They complicate the journey, making it personal. A test might be a literal challenge (a fight, a task), but it’s just as likely to be emotional or social—a betrayal, a moment of trust, a misstep that reveals how out of place the character is. These moments establish the world’s rules and stakes, not through exposition but through experience.Finally, this phase keeps the story’s momentum alive. After the threshold, the narrative can’t stall. The tests, allies, and enemies drive the character forward, even if they’re stumbling. The reader should feel the chaos of the new world but also the possibility of growth, connection, or danger. This is where the story proves it’s worth following.Practical, Personal, and Specific Ways to Write This PhaseTo make this phase practical and personal, focus on grounding the tests, allies, and enemies in the character’s specific reality. These aren’t generic obstacles or archetypes—they’re tailored to the character’s fears, hopes, and blind spots. Here’s how to do it:Design a Specific Test That Hits a Weakness
Pick a challenge that targets something the character’s not good at—or thinks they’re not good at. If your character is a shy accountant who just joined a startup, don’t just throw them into a vague “work challenge.” Make it a meeting where they have to pitch an idea to a skeptical team, their voice cracking as they fumble through notes they stayed up all night preparing. Show their hands shaking as they pass out handouts, or their relief when someone nods but doesn’t ask questions. This test isn’t just about the pitch—it’s about their fear of being seen as inadequate.
Introduce an Ally with a Specific Connection
Allies should feel like real people, not just helpers. Give them a specific trait or moment that ties them to the character’s life. If your character is a high school dropout working in a diner, maybe their ally is a regular customer who’s a retired teacher. She leaves an extra tip and a handwritten note saying, “You’re smarter than you act.” It’s not a grand gesture, but it’s personal—it hits the character’s insecurity about their education. Show them pocketing the note, unsure whether to keep it or toss it. This makes the ally feel like part of their world, not a plot device.
Make an Enemy Specific to the Character’s Flaw
Enemies don’t have to be villains—they just have to oppose the character in a way that stings. Tie the enemy to something the character’s avoiding. If your character is a musician who doubts their talent, their enemy might be a rival bandmate who always gets the solo. Show a specific moment: maybe the rival smirks when the character misses a note during rehearsal, or they “forget” to tell the character about a gig. The enemy’s actions should feel personal, like a jab at the character’s self-worth, not just generic antagonism.
Show a Specific Cost of a Test
Every test should have a consequence, even if it’s small. If your character is a delivery driver navigating a shady new route, don’t just say they got lost. Show them pulling over to check their GPS, their hands sweaty because they’re late and their boss already warned them about tardiness. Maybe they drop a package in their rush, or they notice a creepy figure watching from a corner. The cost—a late delivery, a damaged package, a moment of fear—makes the test feel real and ties it to their life.
Use a Specific Detail to Show the World’s Rules
The new world has its own logic, and the character learns it by screwing up. Be specific about the rule they break and how it backfires. If your character is a new intern at a law firm, maybe they speak up in a meeting when they’re supposed to stay quiet, and a senior lawyer cuts them off with a sharp, “We don’t do that here.” Show them shrinking in their chair, their coffee going cold as the meeting moves on without them. This moment teaches them—and the reader—how this world works, without needing a lecture.

The Emotional and Narrative WeightThis phase is where the character starts to feel the new world’s edges. They’re not in control, and every test, ally, or enemy reminds them of that. The emotional weight comes from their struggle to adapt—whether they’re fumbling, fighting, or faking it. If your character is a single parent starting a new job, show them trying to charm their coworkers but misreading the room, their laugh too loud at a joke no one else finds funny. The reader should feel their awkwardness, their hope, their fear of failing.The narrative weight comes from the way these moments build the story’s stakes. Each test reveals something about the world’s dangers or possibilities. Each ally or enemy complicates the character’s path, making it harder to stay the same. The reader should sense that the character’s old self is slipping, even if they’re fighting to hold onto it.Examples in ActionIn Everything Everywhere All At Once, Evelyn’s Tests, Allies, Enemies phase is the multiverse chaos after she crosses the threshold. She’s tested by bizarre tasks (eating chapstick, screaming in public), allies like Waymond who push her to see herself differently, and enemies like Jobu Tupaki who challenge her reality. A specific moment: when Evelyn tries to fight in a new universe and fails spectacularly, her confusion is palpable—she’s not a hero yet, just a woman out of her depth.In a grounded example, imagine a story about a barista who just moved to a big city. Her new world is the bustling coffee shop. A test: she spills a latte on a rude customer’s laptop, her hands shaking as she mops it up. An ally: the shift manager who covers for her but whispers, “Don’t let it happen again.” An enemy: the coworker who smirks and tells the manager behind her back. These specific moments—tied to her inexperience and fear of failing—make the phase feel personal.In Star Wars: A New Hope, Luke’s Tests, Allies, Enemies phase begins on Tatooine after Obi-Wan’s call. He’s tested by the Sand People attack, allies with Obi-Wan who saves him, and faces enemies like the stormtroopers searching for the droids. A specific moment: when Luke tries to fix R2-D2 but fumbles, showing his inexperience, Obi-Wan’s calm correction grounds their bond.Mistakes to Avoid Making Tests Too Generic
A random fight or obstacle feels hollow. Tie each test to the character’s specific flaws or fears—like a public failure for someone who craves approval. Specific tests make the story theirs. Flat Allies or Enemies
Allies and enemies should have their own motives, not just serve the plot. A specific trait—a nervous tic, a sharp comment—makes them real and their impact personal. Skipping the Emotional Fallout
Every test should leave a mark. Don’t let the character brush it off. Show them replaying a failure in their head or clutching an ally’s kind words like a lifeline.Questions to Ask While WritingWhat’s one specific test that hits the character’s weakest spot?
Who’s one ally who sees something in them they don’t see themselves?
What’s one enemy action that feels like a personal attack?
What’s one rule of the new world they learn the hard way?
What’s one small moment where they surprise themselves—good or bad?What This Means for YouYou’ve been in this phase. The new job where you misread a coworker’s smile and trusted the wrong person. The move to a new city where you got lost on the first day and felt like an idiot. The time you tried something new and failed—or succeeded and didn’t know how to handle it. You know the feeling of being out of your depth, of meeting people who change you, of realizing the rules aren’t what you thought.That’s what your character’s going through. The moment they say the wrong thing and feel the room shift. The moment someone helps them and they don’t know why. The moment they realize they’re not who they were, but they’re not sure who they’re becoming. Write those moments. Write the coffee spill, the nervous laugh, the stranger’s glance that lingers too long.
