CHARACTER ROLE DYNAMICS

What are role dynamics? They’re the shifting relationships and power balances between characters. Role dynamics create tension, conflict, and growth.

I. Why Role Dynamics Matter
No character exists in isolation. Their role in the story changes as they interact with others—ally, rival, mentor, antagonist.

II. Types of Role Dynamics
1. Mentor/Student: One guides, the other learns.
2. Rival/Ally: Competition turns to partnership (or vice versa).
3. Parent/Child: Authority, rebellion, legacy.
4. Leader/Follower: Who takes charge, who resists?
5. Outsider/Insider: Belonging vs. exclusion.

III. Role Dynamics in Action
Show how relationships evolve. Who gains power? Who loses it? How do alliances shift?

IV. Dynamic Arcs
Role dynamics can drive subplots and character arcs. A mentor may become a rival; an ally may betray.

V. Exercise
Write a scene where a role dynamic shifts. What triggers the change?
