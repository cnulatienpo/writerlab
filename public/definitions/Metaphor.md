METAPHOR

What is a metaphor? It’s a figure of speech that compares two unlike things, saying one is the other. Metaphors create vivid imagery and deeper meaning.

I. Why Metaphors Matter
Metaphors make writing memorable. They reveal character, theme, and emotion in a single image.

II. Types of Metaphors
1. Direct: "Her eyes were stars."
2. Implied: "He barked orders."
3. Extended: A metaphor that runs through a scene or story.

III. Metaphor in Action
Use metaphors to show emotion, theme, or transformation. Don’t overdo it—too many can confuse.

IV. Exercise
Write a scene using an extended metaphor for your protagonist’s journey.
