CONFLICT

What is conflict? It’s the engine of story—the clash of opposing forces, desires, or values. Conflict creates tension, stakes, and momentum.

I. Why Conflict Matters
No conflict, no story. Conflict drives change, reveals character, and keeps readers invested.

II. Types of Conflict
1. Internal: Character vs. self (doubt, fear, desire).
2. External: Character vs. character, society, nature, fate, or technology.
3. Philosophical: Clash of ideas, beliefs, or worldviews.

III. Conflict in Action
Show conflict through choices, obstacles, and consequences. How do characters respond to pressure?

IV. Escalation
Conflict should intensify, forcing characters to adapt or break.

V. Resolution
Conflict ends with change—victory, defeat, compromise, or transformation.

VI. Exercise
Write a scene where conflict escalates. What’s at stake? Who wins?
