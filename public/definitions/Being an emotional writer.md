Most people think being a “good writer” means having ideas just pour out of you like you’re some kind of genius factory, like cleverness alone can carry you through. Arrange those ideas well enough—get your scenes in order, make sure the grammar doesn’t embarrass you, slap it up on Amazon—and boom, applause and money roll in. Easy, right? Except none of that’s the heartbeat. The real driving force behind writing is something else. It’s this gnarly, raw emotional engine you have to learn to fuel and keep running.

Think of yourself in the driver’s seat, yeah? You’re steering, sure, but the car won’t move unless the engine is firing on all cylinders. That engine—this “emotional labor,” or whatever we want to call it—is the real powerhouse of your writing. The mechanical stuff, the scene logistics, the plot points—that’s the chassis, the tires, the steering wheel. Necessary, but ultimately meaningless if the engine’s dead. No soul in the tank means no motion, no momentum, no meaning.

Now, what’s it like to be that engine? To write with your soul on the line? It’s messy and unpredictable. It’s not always tears or dramatic breakdowns, but it often feels like your guts are being pulled outside your body and stretched on some cruel rack. Writing like this can be exhausting and scary—it’s like crying, but in words; it’s like sweating out a sickness. But it’s not just pain. It can also be wild laughter at the absurdity of your own mess, or a quiet relief like after a brutal therapy session. It’s paradoxical: you might be shaking with rage and grief, and five pages later cracking up at how ridiculous it all sounds.

 Is it like therapy? Yeah. Sort of. You’re sitting across from the hardest client you’ll ever face—yourself. And you’re trying to get them to open up, confess, reveal the parts they usually bury deep or hide behind humor or bravado. But unlike therapy, where you pay someone else to hear you out, here you’re the one writing and the one reading. You’re your own witness, your own judge, your own breaker and healer.

Expect to feel vulnerable, to stare into the abyss of your own darkness and weirdness, and to sometimes want to run away screaming. Expect the process to demand more from you than you thought you had. And expect moments of utter clarity where you finally say, “Okay, this is what I’m really trying to say, and it fucking hurts.” That moment is gold. It’s the diamond in the muck.

But also expect this: when you write honestly, you don’t just change the page. You change yourself. Writing like this is a kind of self-excavation. You dig deeper than your usual day-to-day thoughts. You uncover things you didn’t even know were there. And when those truths hit the page, they hit you too. They bruise you. They shape you. They keep you honest.

So if you want to be a writer who moves people—not just entertains them—you have to be willing to pay that price. It’s not just a creative hobby; it’s a kind of emotional alchemy. You take your pain, your shame, your joy, your anger, and you turn it into something that others can see themselves in. That’s what makes writing matter.

No magic shortcuts here. No trick or formula that skips the real work. The cleverness you thought would carry you? It’s just the spark to light the engine. The engine itself is built from honesty, risk, and that terrible, beautiful willingness to show up and get gutted on the page.
