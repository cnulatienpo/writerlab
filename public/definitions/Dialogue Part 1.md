DIALOGUE PART 1: THE BASICS

What is dialogue? It’s the spoken (or unspoken) exchange between characters. Dialogue reveals character, advances plot, and creates subtext.

I. Why Dialogue Matters
Dialogue brings characters to life. It’s how they express wants, fears, and secrets.

II. The Three Functions of Dialogue
1. Reveal: Show character, backstory, or motivation.
2. Advance: Move the plot forward.
3. Subvert: Hide meaning beneath the surface (subtext).

III. Dialogue in Action
Show, don’t tell. Use dialogue to create tension, humor, or surprise.

IV. Avoiding Exposition
Don’t use dialogue to dump information. Let characters speak naturally, with their own voice.

V. Exercise
Write a scene of pure dialogue. What’s left unsaid?
