CHARACTER BACKSTORY

What is backstory? It’s the sum of everything that happened to your character before page one. It’s the invisible architecture that shapes their fears, desires, and decisions.

I. Why Backstory Matters
Backstory explains why your character is the way they are. It gives context to their flaws, wounds, and motivations. But too much backstory can bog down the narrative—reveal it strategically.

II. The Backstory Iceberg
Only 10% of backstory should be on the page. The rest is for you, the writer, to know. Hint at the depths beneath the surface.

III. Backstory Delivery Methods
1. Flashback: A vivid memory interrupts the present.
2. Dialogue: Characters reveal bits of their past.
3. Subtext: Actions and choices hint at history.
4. Symbolism: Objects or places evoke memories.

IV. The Backstory Wound
Every character has a wound—a defining trauma or loss. This wound shapes their arc and drives their actions.

V. Exercise
Write a scene where your character’s backstory wound surfaces in the present. How does it affect their choices?
