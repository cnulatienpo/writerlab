CHARACTER TRUTH

What is truth? It’s the core belief or realization a character must face. Truth is the antidote to the character’s lie—the false belief that holds them back.

I. Why Truth Matters
The journey from lie to truth is the heart of the character arc. Truth brings growth, healing, or sometimes pain.

II. Types of Truth
1. Self-Acceptance: Embracing flaws and strengths.
2. Forgiveness: Letting go of guilt or anger.
3. Responsibility: Owning one’s actions and choices.
4. Love: Realizing the value of connection.
5. Purpose: Discovering meaning or calling.

III. Truth in Action
Show truth through revelation, confession, or decisive action. How does the character change when they accept the truth?

IV. Truth and Arc
The arc is the journey toward (or away from) truth. Some characters reject the truth, leading to tragedy.

V. Exercise
Write a scene where your character confronts a painful truth. What do they do?
