METAPHORS PART 2: ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

I. Mixed Metaphors
Avoid mixing metaphors in the same sentence or scene. It confuses the image ("He sailed through the exam with flying colors").

II. Dead Metaphors
Metaphors that have lost their impact through overuse ("the heart of the matter"). Use fresh images.

III. Thematic Metaphors
Use metaphors to reinforce theme. A recurring image can unify a story.

IV. Exercise
Identify a dead metaphor in your writing. Replace it with a fresh, original image.
