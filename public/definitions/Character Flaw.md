CHARACTER FLAW

What is a flaw? It’s the imperfection that makes your character human. Flaws create conflict, drive arcs, and make readers care.

I. Why Flaws Matter
Perfect characters are boring. Flaws create tension, obstacles, and opportunities for growth.

II. Types of Flaws
1. Fear: Afraid of failure, intimacy, or the unknown.
2. Pride: Overconfidence, arrogance, or stubbornness.
3. Guilt: Haunted by past mistakes.
4. Self-Doubt: Insecurity, imposter syndrome.
5. Obsession: Fixation on a goal or person.

III. Flaw in Action
Show flaws through mistakes, regrets, and self-sabotage. How do flaws create problems—or unexpected strengths?

IV. Flaw and Arc
The arc is often about confronting and overcoming (or succumbing to) the flaw.

V. Exercise
Write a scene where your character’s flaw causes trouble. How do they react?
