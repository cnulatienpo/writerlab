CHARACTER DRIVE

What is drive? It’s the engine that propels your character through the story. Drive is what they want most—and what they’ll do to get it.

I. Why Drive Matters
Drive creates momentum. A character with a strong drive is active, not passive. Their pursuit of a goal shapes every scene.

II. Types of Drive
1. Survival: Stay alive at all costs.
2. Love: Win or protect someone’s heart.
3. Power: Gain control, status, or influence.
4. Justice: Right a wrong, seek revenge.
5. Truth: Uncover secrets, solve mysteries.

III. Drive vs. Motivation
Drive is the goal; motivation is the why. A character may want power (drive) because they were powerless as a child (motivation).

IV. Drive in Action
Show drive through choices, sacrifices, and risks. What lines will your character cross—or refuse to cross?

V. Exercise
Write a scene where your character’s drive puts them in conflict with another’s. What happens?
