CHARACTER IDENTITY

What is identity? It’s the core of who your character believes they are. Identity shapes choices, relationships, and arcs.

I. Why Identity Matters
Identity is the lens through which your character sees the world. It’s shaped by culture, upbringing, trauma, and triumph.

II. Identity in Conflict
Stories test identity. What happens when your character’s self-image is challenged, shattered, or remade?

III. Identity and Theme
The character’s journey often mirrors the story’s theme. As they change, so does their understanding of themselves.

IV. Identity in Action
Show identity through choices, language, and relationships. What lines won’t your character cross? What masks do they wear?

V. Exercise
Write a scene where your character’s identity is put to the test. What do they do?
