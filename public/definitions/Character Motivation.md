CHARACTER MOTIVATION

What is motivation? It’s the reason behind every action your character takes. Motivation is the "why" that drives the "what."

I. Why Motivation Matters
Motivation makes characters believable. Readers may not agree with their choices, but they must understand them.

II. Types of Motivation
1. Love: Seeking connection, approval, or protection.
2. Fear: Avoiding pain, loss, or danger.
3. Revenge: Righting a wrong, settling a score.
4. Ambition: Achieving power, status, or recognition.
5. Redemption: Making up for past mistakes.

III. Motivation vs. Drive
Drive is the goal; motivation is the reason. A character may want revenge (drive) because they lost someone (motivation).

IV. Motivation in Action
Show motivation through choices, sacrifices, and justifications. What will your character do—or refuse to do—for their goal?

V. Exercise
Write a scene where your character’s motivation is revealed through action, not dialogue.
