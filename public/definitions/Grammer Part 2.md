GRAMMAR PART 2: SENTENCE STRUCTURE

I. The Sentence
A sentence is a complete thought. It has a subject and a predicate.

II. Types of Sentences
1. Simple: One independent clause ("She runs.")
2. Compound: Two independent clauses joined by a conjunction ("She runs, and he walks.")
3. Complex: One independent and one or more dependent clauses ("She runs because she’s late.")
4. Compound-Complex: Two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause ("She runs, and he walks because he’s tired.")

III. Sentence Fragments
A fragment is an incomplete sentence. Use with care for style, but don’t confuse the reader.

IV. Run-Ons and Comma Splices
Run-on: Two sentences joined without punctuation ("She runs he walks.")
Comma splice: Two sentences joined by a comma ("She runs, he walks.")
Fix with a period, semicolon, or conjunction.

V. Exercise
Write one of each sentence type about your protagonist.
