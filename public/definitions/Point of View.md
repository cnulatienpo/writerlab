POINT OF VIEW

What is point of view? It’s the perspective from which a story is told—first person, third person, omniscient, etc.

I. Why POV Matters
POV shapes what readers know, feel, and believe. It controls intimacy, suspense, and theme.

II. Types of POV
1. First Person: "I"—inside one character’s mind.
2. Third Person Limited: "He/She"—inside one character at a time.
3. Third Person Omniscient: All-knowing narrator.
4. Second Person: "You"—rare, direct address.

III. POV in Action
Choose POV to match story needs. Switch POV with care—clarity is key.

IV. Exercise
Write a scene in two different POVs. How does it change?
