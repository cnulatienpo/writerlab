1. What’s your happy place as a writer?
I want a detailed template, a prompt, a pile of tropes, or a fill-in-the-blanks outline to riff on—don’t make me invent it all from scratch.

Everything is up for grabs; I collect, swipe, and remix the best bits from everywhere.

I need to feel the scene in my body—acting it out, using my voice, or just letting the drama run wild.

If it’s not connected—theme, symbol, echoes—I lose interest. I crave structure, patterns, secret puzzles.

Freedom to explore and get lost; plans and outlines kill the fun.

If it bleeds, it leads—I want to write what I feel, ugly or beautiful.

My tool is a wild new challenge or rule—give me constraints, or I get bored fast.

I need to know the world’s lore, every character’s backstory, and have a spreadsheet for the plot.

I’m just catching whatever the characters or story want to say, like a radio tuned to their frequency.

I want my writing to mean something—a big idea, a worldview, a cause to shout about.

2. What makes you rage-quit writing?
Boring, flat scenes where nobody moves or cares.

A world that makes no sense—plot holes, lore gaps, or contradictions.

People asking me endless questions about plot and character and expecting me to have all the answers instead of giving me something to start with. Please, stop with the questions—I need a scaffold, not an interrogation.

Writing that doesn’t have a point—no message, no soul, just noise.

Being told “don’t steal.” Sorry, I will.

If I have to repeat myself or follow the same routine, I’ll combust.

A mess of random scenes with no structure, no connections, no payoff.

Being forced to outline or stick to a plan when I just want to wander.

Being told to dial it down or write something less “emotional.”

When the voice in my head goes quiet, the characters stop talking, and the page is dead.

3. How do you get unstuck?
Give myself a challenge: “Write backwards, only questions, 100 words max—go!”

Ask the story or characters what’s next and wait until they tell me.

Jump to a wild new scene, a strange direction, or another story altogether.

Draw diagrams, use sticky notes, color-code for echoes and motifs.

Swipe an idea from a movie, book, or stranger on the train—then twist it.

Consult my plot spreadsheet, lore docs, or backstory bible until it clicks.

Act out the scene, voice the dialogue, move until it’s real.

Spin the trope wheel, fill in a prompt, or use an outline to give me a starting place—never blank, never endless questions.

Ask myself what I’m really trying to say and make it bigger, louder, or clearer.

Dump my feelings into a poem, journal, or messy monologue and sort it out later.

4. Pick a tool.
Anything that lets me transcribe the story “as it arrives”—voice memo, notebook, Ouija board.

Playlist, mood journal, and tissues—feeling is the engine.

A secret stash of lines, images, and setups to remix at will.

A soapbox, a manifesto, or a whiteboard for my Big Idea.

Random constraint spinner, challenge jar, or “weird rules” app.

A voice recorder or a full-length mirror to act out scenes.

A blank page—no plan, no map, no pressure.

Color-coded index cards, structure tracker, mind map.

Trope-a-matic, detailed template, prompt generator, fill-in-the-blanks structure—just give me a skeleton to work from!

Worldbuilder spreadsheet, family tree, plot outline with tabs for everything.

5. When writing is good, what’s actually happening?
Every piece fits—the world makes sense, the plot is tight, nothing is random.

Patterns are firing, structure is singing, every scene is an echo or a twist.

I’m racing through a detailed outline, prompt, or trope and turning it into something new—I never start from nothing.

I’m assembling a Frankenstein’s monster out of the best bits from everywhere.

I lose myself in the scene—voice, movement, feeling alive.

I’m swimming in raw feeling and don’t care how it looks yet.

I’m wandering, taking risks, stumbling onto treasure I never planned for.

Pulling off a writing dare or trick, showing off what weird rules can do.

Capturing the story as it “arrives”—it doesn’t feel like work, it feels like listening.

Every sentence glows with my message, theme, or Big Question.
