{
  "1": "Blueprint Writer / Scaffold-Builder: You love a plan. Nothing gets you going like a clear outline, worksheet, or template. You'd rather build on a strong skeleton than reinvent the wheel.",
  "2": "Remixer / Thief: Why invent when you can remix? You collect, borrow, and twist everything, building something new out of what already works.",
  "3": "Actor: Writing is a performance for you. You live in dialogue, act out scenes, and channel your characters.",
  "4": "Patterner: You're all about structure, motif, and hidden connections. You see echoes and patterns nobody else notices.",
  "5": "Explorer: You hate being boxed in. Discovery writing, leaping into the unknown, and finding surprise is your game.",
  "6": "Feeler: For you, writing is feeling. If it doesn't move you, why bother? You bleed on the page.",
  "7": "Tester: You crave rules—but only so you can break them. Challenges, dares, and weird constraints are your fuel.",
  "8": "Worldbuilder: Lore, backstory, spreadsheets—your universes have depth. You want every character, place, and plot point documented.",
  "9": "Transcriber: The story flows through you like a radio signal. You just need to catch it as it arrives.",
  "10": "Thematist / Meaning-Driven: Big ideas drive you. If your story doesn't say something real, you lose interest fast."
