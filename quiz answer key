Answer Key for the Writer Type Quiz
Each question has answer choices numbered 1–10, each mapping to one writer type.
When the player submits, count how many times each number was picked.
The number with the highest count = the player’s writer type.

How to Score
Tally up the player’s selections (e.g., [2, 1, 5, 1, 1] = 1 is picked most).

The number that appears the most = that’s the player’s main writer type.

If there’s a tie, let the player pick between those tied types, or assign “Hybrid” and let them choose.
